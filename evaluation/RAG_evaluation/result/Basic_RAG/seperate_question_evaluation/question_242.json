  "question": "How do schools obtain emergency Albuterol supplies, and what are the medical documentation requirements for student medications at school?",
  "generated_answer": "Schools can obtain emergency Albuterol supplies by having their medical director (a licensed physician, a physician's assistant, or nurse practitioner) get a prescription for Albuterol solution from Beverly Hills Pharmacy (Phone: 314.381.8600 or Fax: 314.381.6844). For student medications at school, medical documentation requirements include a signed Parent Consent/Administration Form and a completed Physician/Prescription Medication Form for prescription medications, and a signed parent consent for over-the-counter medications. All orders must be renewed each school year. Students with proper physician orders and parental consent may carry inhalers and EpiPens.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "To obtain emergency Albuterol, schools in St. Louis City/County (MO) or St. Clair/Madison Counties (IL) can receive a free first round from Beverly Hills Pharmacy with a prescription from their Medical Director. Schools without a Medical Director can get assistance from Dr. Jim Wedner or Dr. David Campbell. For student medications at school, parents must provide a medication consent form (Form 1A) signed by both parent and physician for prescription medications, which must be in original pharmacy containers. Non-prescription medications require the original container and signed parent permission form. Students cannot carry medications without written agreement between the school district and parent, authorized by the student's physician.",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the information provided in relation to the ground truth answer.\n\n1. **Obtaining Emergency Albuterol Supplies**: The ground truth specifies that schools in specific locations (St. Louis City/County, MO, or St. Clair/Madison Counties, IL) can receive a free first round of emergency Albuterol from Beverly Hills Pharmacy with a prescription from their Medical Director. It also provides alternatives for schools without a Medical Director. The generated answer simplifies this by stating that a medical director can get a prescription for Albuterol solution from Beverly Hills Pharmacy, providing contact information. While it captures the essence of involving a medical director and Beverly Hills Pharmacy, it lacks specificity about the locations and the process for schools without a Medical Director. Thus, it partially covers this aspect but introduces contact information not present in the ground truth, which could be considered slightly irrelevant.\n\n2. **Medical Documentation Requirements for Student Medications**: The ground truth outlines that parents must provide a medication consent form (Form 1A) signed by both parent and physician for prescription medications, which must be in original pharmacy containers. For non-prescription medications, the original container and a signed parent permission form are required. The generated answer mentions a signed Parent Consent/Administration Form and a completed Physician/Prescription Medication Form for prescription medications, and a signed parent consent for over-the-counter medications. This information is largely consistent with the ground truth, though the specific form names differ. The generated answer also mentions that all orders must be renewed each school year, which is not mentioned in the ground truth but could be considered relevant administrative information.\n\n3. **Relevance and Coverage**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about obtaining emergency Albuterol supplies and the medical documentation requirements for student medications at school. However, it introduces some details (like contact information for Beverly Hills Pharmacy and the renewal of orders) not found in the ground truth, which could be seen as slightly irrelevant or additional information. The coverage of vital information is good, but not complete, especially regarding the specifics of the Albuterol supply process for all eligible schools.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is largely correct but contains some irrelevant or additional information not specified in the ground truth. It does not fully capture the nuances of the process for obtaining emergency Albuterol supplies for all schools as outlined in the ground truth but does provide a generally accurate overview of the medical documentation requirements.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
