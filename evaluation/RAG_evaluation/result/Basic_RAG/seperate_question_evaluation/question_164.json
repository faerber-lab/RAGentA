  "question": "What is the maximum weight that the glass and timber pillar was able to withstand during testing?",
  "generated_answer": "The glass and timber pillar was able to withstand a maximum load of about 390 kN (39 tonnes) during testing.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The glass and timber pillar was compression-tested up to about 390 kN (39 tonnes), which was the maximum that the test equipment could deliver, without any failure occurring. The buckling failure load is estimated to be 5-10 times higher than this.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claims made in the answer and check if they are supported by the passages.\n\nThe answer claims: \"The glass and timber pillar was able to withstand a maximum load of about 390 kN (39 tonnes) during testing.\"\n\nThis claim is directly supported by Passage 1, which states: \"It was loaded to about 390 kN (39 tonnes), which was the maximum that the test equipment could deliver, without any failure occurring.\"\n\nThere are no other claims in the answer that need to be verified against the passages. Since the single claim made in the answer is directly supported by one of the passages, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer states that the glass and timber pillar was able to withstand a maximum load of about 390 kN (39 tonnes) during testing. This directly corresponds to a key piece of information from the ground truth answer, which mentions that the pillar was compression-tested up to about 390 kN (39 tonnes). However, the ground truth also provides additional information that the buckling failure load is estimated to be 5-10 times higher than this tested maximum. The generated answer does not include this additional detail, which means it covers only part of the vital information from the ground truth. Despite this, the core of the question\u2014regarding the maximum weight the pillar was able to withstand during testing\u2014is addressed.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question without including any unnecessary information. It focuses solely on the maximum load the pillar withstood during testing, which is precisely what the question asks. There is no extraneous information that could be considered irrelevant to the question posed.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in the sense that it accurately reports the maximum load withstood by the pillar during testing. However, it lacks the additional context provided in the ground truth about the estimated buckling failure load. Since the question specifically asks for the maximum weight the pillar was able to withstand during testing and not about the estimated failure load, the omission of the latter does not make the answer incorrect but rather incomplete in terms of the full scope of information provided in the ground truth.\n\nConsidering the continuous scale provided:\n- The answer is not incorrect (-1), as it correctly states the maximum load withstood during testing.\n- It does not contain irrelevant information, which would have led to a score of 1.\n- It is not a case of no answer provided (0).\n- It is correct and directly relevant to the question asked, but since it doesn't cover all aspects of the ground truth (like the estimated failure load), one might argue it's not completely comprehensive. However, given the question's focus, the answer is directly on point.\n\nTherefore, considering the answer directly addresses the question without unnecessary information and is factually correct about the maximum load, but acknowledging the scale and the aspects of coverage and relevance:\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
