  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claims made in the answer and check if they are supported by the passages.\n\nThe answer claims: \"The recommended number of people needed to safely install pin fixed or side mounted glass panels is three. This is because it is a three-person job to ensure the glass is handled safely and to prevent potential damage to the glass or injury to the installers.\"\n\nFrom the passages, we find support for this claim in PASSAGE 4, which states: \"For pin fixed/side mounted glass: - Glass panel installation is a three-person job, don\u2019t attempt this solo as you\u2019ll potentially damage the glass or yourself!\"\n\nThis directly supports the claim made in the answer regarding the recommended number of people for safely installing pin fixed or side mounted glass panels.\n\nSince the claim in the answer is directly supported by one of the passages without any contradictory information in the other passages, the faithfulness of the answer can be considered as fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": 2.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer states that the recommended number of people needed to safely install pin fixed or side mounted glass panels is three. This directly aligns with the ground truth answer, which also specifies that it is a three-person job to prevent potential damage to the glass or injury. Therefore, the generated answer covers the vital information from the ground truth, which is the number of people required for safe installation.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing the recommended number of people needed for the installation. It also provides a brief justification for why three people are recommended, which is to ensure the glass is handled safely and to prevent potential damage or injury. This justification is relevant to understanding why the specific number is recommended, although the question itself only asks for the number of people. The additional information about safety and prevention of damage does not detract from the answer but rather supports the reasoning behind the recommendation. However, it could be argued that the question only seeks the number, making the justification slightly beyond what is strictly necessary.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in terms of the information it provides about the number of people needed. It fully covers the vital information from the ground truth answer and is relevant to the question asked. However, it includes a slight expansion on the reasoning, which might be considered as providing more information than strictly requested.\n\nSince the answer is correct, completely relevant to the question, and provides the necessary information without omitting any vital details or including misleading information, but includes a minor elaboration, the score should reflect its accuracy and direct relevance to the question.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
