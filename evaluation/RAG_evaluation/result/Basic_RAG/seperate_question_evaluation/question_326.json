  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The documents provided do not contain specific information about the weight load capacity of Panasonic's exoskeleton.\n   - **Support**: Partially supported. While the passages do mention Panasonic's exoskeleton, they do provide some information about its weight load capacity, specifically in Passage 1, which mentions that the suit enables the wearer to carry 33 pounds of extra load. Additionally, Passage 2 discusses another Panasonic exoskeleton model, the Power Loader, which can lift weights up to 100 Kg (220 lbs) and with force improvements, up to 227 Kg (500 lbs).\n\n2. **Claim**: Panasonic's exoskeleton can carry an additional 33 pounds (approximately 15 kg) of load.\n   - **Support**: Fully supported by Passage 1.\n\n3. **Claim**: For more precise information, you would need to refer to Panasonic's official product specifications or contact their customer support.\n   - **Support**: This claim is not directly supported by any passage but is a reasonable suggestion given the context.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer has both fully supported and partially supported claims. The critical information about the weight load capacity of Panasonic's exoskeleton is directly supported by Passage 1, but the implication that the documents lack specific information about the weight load capacity is not entirely accurate due to the details provided in Passages 1 and 2. The suggestion to refer to official product specifications or customer support for precise information, while reasonable, is not directly supported by the passages.\n\nConsidering the balance of support and the importance of the claims, the faithfulness score would lean towards partial support, as the answer does provide accurate information from the passages but also makes a claim about the lack of specific information that is not entirely accurate.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.5",
  "correctness_score": 1.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer mentions that Panasonic's exoskeleton can carry an additional 33 pounds of load, which is directly taken from the ground truth answer. However, it misses the part about the company testing a larger suit designed to help carry loads as heavy as 220 pounds. This means the generated answer covers only a portion of the vital information provided in the ground truth. The coverage is partial, as it includes one key piece of information but omits another.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about the weight load capacity of Panasonic's exoskeleton by providing the 33-pound figure. However, it also includes a statement about the documents provided and the suggestion to refer to Panasonic's official product specifications or contact their customer support for more precise information. This additional information, while not incorrect, is not directly relevant to answering the question based on the ground truth provided. It introduces a layer of uncertainty and a call for further action that is not necessary given the context of the question and the ground truth answer.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is correct in the sense that it provides some accurate information about the weight load capacity of Panasonic's exoskeleton. However, it lacks complete coverage of the ground truth information and includes some irrelevant details. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 2, which requires the answer to be both correct and completely relevant without unnecessary information.\n\nGiven the analysis, the most appropriate score would reflect that the answer is correct but contains irrelevant information and does not fully cover the vital information from the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
