  "question": "How does the legal enforcement of meal breaks in California workplaces differ from the practical reality of meal breaks in hospital settings?",
  "generated_answer": "The documents provided do not contain specific information about the legal enforcement of meal breaks in California workplaces or the practical reality of meal breaks in hospital settings. Therefore, I cannot provide a comparison based on the given documents.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "In California, employers must make meal breaks available and can face financial penalties (one hour of regular pay per violation) if they don't comply with break requirements. However, in hospital settings, nurses routinely miss meals to care for patients, as shown by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality study. While California law requires breaks to be uninterrupted and duty-free, the practical reality in healthcare is that nurses often resort to quick snacks from vending machines or need to modify their meal patterns due to unpredictable patient care demands, even though this isn't ideal for their health and performance.",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not cover any of the vital information from the ground truth. It states that the documents provided do not contain specific information about the legal enforcement of meal breaks in California workplaces or the practical reality of meal breaks in hospital settings. However, the question itself implies that such information should be known or is available, and the ground truth answer provides detailed insights into both the legal requirements and the practical realities. Since the generated answer does not address the actual differences between the legal enforcement and the practical reality in hospital settings, its coverage of the vital information is zero.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is not directly addressing the question. Instead of providing information about how the legal enforcement of meal breaks in California workplaces differs from the practical reality in hospital settings, it deflects by stating that the necessary information is not available in the provided documents. This response does not contain any relevant information that would help answer the question, making it irrelevant to the query posed.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer falls into the category of \"No answer provided\" because it does not attempt to address the question with any substance. It simply states that the information is not available, without making any effort to provide the comparison requested in the question.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0",
