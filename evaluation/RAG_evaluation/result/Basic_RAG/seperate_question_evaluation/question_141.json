  "question": "According to social psychology research, how does the presence of others affect task performance?",
  "generated_answer": "The presence of others can have different effects on task performance depending on the nature of the task and the individual's familiarity with it. According to social psychology research, the presence of others can lead to social facilitation, where individuals perform better on tasks they are already good at, due to increased arousal and the desire to impress or compete. This is supported by studies such as those by Norman Triplett and Robert Zajonc.\n\nHowever, the presence of others can also lead to social inhibition, where individuals perform worse on tasks they are not as skilled at, due to increased anxiety or distraction. This is because the presence of others can increase arousal, which can be beneficial for simple, well-learned tasks but detrimental for complex, unfamiliar tasks.\n\nAdditionally, factors such as evaluation apprehension, distraction, and the nature of the social interaction (e.g., competition vs. cooperation) can influence how the presence of others affects task performance. For example, if individuals feel they are being evaluated, they may experience increased pressure, which can either enhance or impair performance depending on the task and individual differences.\n\nIn summary, the presence of others can either facilitate or inhibit task performance, depending on the task difficulty, individual skill level, and the psychological state induced by the presence of others.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "According to Zajonc's research, when a task is simple and people feel capable, their performance improves in the presence of others. However, if they feel less capable or the task is challenging, performance declines due to increased anxiety. Studies by Sanna and Shotland found that people's perception of how others would evaluate them either stimulated better performance in expectation of approval or led to poor performance in expectation of negative evaluation.",

The passages consistently discuss the dual effects of the presence of others on task performance (social facilitation and social inhibition), the role of arousal, task difficulty, individual skill level, and the nature of social interaction. Therefore, the faithfulness of the answer to the information provided in the passages is high.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers several key points from the ground truth. It mentions that the presence of others can have different effects on task performance, depending on the nature of the task and the individual's familiarity with it. This aligns with the ground truth's explanation of performance improvement in simple tasks when individuals feel capable and decline in challenging tasks or when they feel less capable. The generated answer specifically references social facilitation for tasks individuals are good at and social inhibition for tasks they are not skilled at, which parallels the ground truth's discussion on performance changes due to the presence of others. However, the generated answer does not explicitly mention the studies by Sanna and Shotland or the specific dynamics of expectation of approval or negative evaluation as mentioned in the ground truth. Despite this, it does touch on evaluation apprehension, which is related. Therefore, the coverage is substantial but not complete.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is directly addressing the question about how the presence of others affects task performance, according to social psychology research. It provides explanations and examples that are relevant to the question, discussing the impact of the presence of others on performance in a way that is consistent with the principles of social psychology. The mention of Norman Triplett and Robert Zajonc adds relevance by grounding the explanation in actual research. The discussion on evaluation apprehension, distraction, and the nature of social interaction (competition vs. cooperation) also stays relevant to the question by exploring factors that influence task performance in the presence of others. However, some might argue that the detailed exploration of these factors introduces a level of complexity that, while relevant, expands the answer beyond the most direct and simple response to the question.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is largely correct and directly addresses the question. It covers the main points about how the presence of others can affect task performance, though it does so with some additional detail and without referencing every specific study or dynamic mentioned in the ground truth. The information provided is relevant and enhances the understanding of the topic, even if it includes a broader discussion than the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
