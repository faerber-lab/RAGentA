  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claims made in the answer and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\nThe answer states, \"I don't have enough information to answer the question about garlic chile spray and harissa paste storage time.\"\n\nClaim 1: Lack of information about garlic chile spray storage time.\n- The passages provide a recipe and method for making a garlic and chile spray (Passage 8), which includes instructions on how to prepare and use it, but they do not specifically mention the storage time for this spray.\n\nClaim 2: Lack of information about harissa paste storage time.\n- Passage 3 directly addresses the storage of harissa paste, stating it can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, with a layer of oil covering the harissa to keep it fresh.\n\nGiven the information in the passages:\n- There is no direct information provided about the storage time for garlic chile spray.\n- There is specific information provided about the storage time for harissa paste.\n\nSince the answer claims a lack of information for both garlic chile spray and harissa paste storage times, but the passages actually provide information on the storage time for harissa paste, the answer is not fully supported by the passages. However, it is partially supported because there is indeed a lack of information about the storage time for the garlic chile spray.\n\nTherefore, the faithfulness score should reflect that the answer is partially supported by the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not provide any specific information regarding the storage time of garlic chile spray or harissa paste. It simply states a lack of information, which means it does not cover any portion of the vital information present in the ground truth answer. The ground truth provides specific storage conditions and durations for both products, which are entirely absent in the generated answer.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is somewhat relevant in the sense that it directly addresses the question by stating an inability to provide an answer. However, it does not offer any useful information towards answering the query about the storage times of garlic chile spray and harissa paste. The relevance is limited to acknowledging the question without providing a solution or any related information.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not provide any correct information about the storage times of garlic chile spray and harissa paste. It does not cover any vital information from the ground truth and only marginally addresses the question by indicating a lack of information.\n\nSince the generated answer does not contain any correct information and essentially states that it cannot provide an answer, it aligns with the description of \"No answer provided.\" However, because it explicitly states an inability to answer rather than providing incorrect information, it fits best with a score that reflects a lack of useful response.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0.0",
