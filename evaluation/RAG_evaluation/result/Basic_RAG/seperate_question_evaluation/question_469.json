In contrast, the generated answer lists several organizations but does not directly mention clinics like the Transnational Legal Clinic.

Additionally, it lists other organizations that provide support services, such as HealthRight International Human Rights Clinic, TASSC, and the International Rescue Committee (IRC), which are relevant to supporting survivors of torture and human rights abuses.\n\n**Coverage**: The generated answer covers a significant portion of the vital information from the ground truth, especially regarding support for torture survivors in the United States. However, it introduces a broader range of organizations than those specifically mentioned in the ground truth, which may not all be directly relevant to the exact question asked.\n\n**Relevance**: While the generated answer directly addresses the question by providing legal resources and support mechanisms for international human rights advocacy and torture survivors, it contains a considerable amount of information that, although related, is not directly mentioned in the ground truth.

However, it contains a significant amount of additional information that, while not incorrect, makes the answer less focused than the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
