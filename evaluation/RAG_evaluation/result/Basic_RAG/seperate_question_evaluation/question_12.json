The passages do provide some information about Lee Brice's nominations and participation in the ACM Awards but lack specific details about Holly Dunn's involvement or achievements related to the ACM Awards.\n\nSince the answer does not make any claims that are contradicted by the passages and acknowledges the lack of information for a direct comparison, it demonstrates a level of faithfulness to the content of the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not provide any specific information about Lee Brice and Holly Dunn's recognition or nominations from the ACM Awards. It simply states a lack of information, which means it fails to cover any vital information present in the ground truth. The ground truth provides detailed information about the awards and nominations both artists received, which is entirely absent in the generated answer.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The question asks for a comparison between Lee Brice and Holly Dunn in the context of the ACM Awards. The generated answer does not provide any comparison or relevant information about their achievements or recognition from the ACM Awards. Instead, it offers an apology for not having enough information, which does not address the question directly.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not provide any correct or relevant information regarding the comparison between Lee Brice and Holly Dunn in the context of the ACM Awards. It does not cover any portion of the vital information from the ground truth and does not directly address the question without unnecessary information. The closest evaluation based on the provided scale would be \"0: No answer provided,\" as the generated answer essentially states that it cannot provide an answer due to a lack of information, without offering any relevant details.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0.0",
