  "faithfulness_evaluation": "The answer provided is \"I don't have enough information.\" To evaluate the faithfulness of this answer, we need to determine if the passages provide sufficient information to compare the purposes of Yale Bulldogs sports team and Tyndale House in terms of their institutional missions.\n\n1. **Yale Bulldogs Sports Team Mission**: The passages primarily discuss the history, activities, and achievements of Yale's athletic teams, including the Bulldogs. However, they do not explicitly state the mission of the Yale Bulldogs sports team. Instead, they focus on the team's performances, traditions, and the university's support for athletics. There is no direct statement about the mission or purpose of the sports team in relation to the university's overall mission or values.\n\n2. **Tyndale House Mission**: Passage 2 clearly outlines Tyndale's mission statement, which includes the pursuit of truth, excellence in teaching, learning, and research, and serving the church and the world for the glory of God. It also details Tyndale's roots in the Protestant Evangelical tradition and its commitment to biblical principles.\n\n3. **Comparison**: To compare the purposes of the Yale Bulldogs sports team and Tyndale House, one would need information on how the sports team's activities align with or reflect Yale University's broader mission and values, and then compare this with Tyndale House's mission. While Passage 2 provides a clear mission statement for Tyndale, the passages do not offer a comparable statement for the Yale Bulldogs or explicitly link the team's purpose to Yale's institutional mission.\n\nGiven this analysis, the answer \"I don't have enough information\" is supported because the passages do not provide a direct comparison or sufficient information to evaluate how the purposes of the Yale Bulldogs sports team and Tyndale House align with their respective institutional missions.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
