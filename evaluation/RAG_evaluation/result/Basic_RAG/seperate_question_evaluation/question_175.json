  "question": "injury rate soccer compared american football which sport more injuries",
  "generated_answer": "Based on the provided documents, American football generally has a higher injury rate compared to soccer. American football is classified as a contact sport with a high risk of injuries, including knee injuries, concussions, and cervical spine injuries. The documents mention that American football is ranked as the third most dangerous sport due to the sheer numbers of injuries, with 212,000 children seen in emergency rooms for football injuries in 2009.\n\nIn contrast, while soccer is also a contact sport, the injury rate is lower than that of American football. Soccer players are more likely to suffer musculoskeletal injuries to the lower body, but the overall injury rate is less severe. The documents state that soccer is ranked as the sixth most dangerous sport, with 88,000 soccer players between the ages of 5 and 14 seen in emergency rooms for sports injuries in 2009.\n\nYouth football has a lower injury rate compared to high school, college, and professional levels, with fewer catastrophic injuries. Organized football among 5-15-year-olds has 12% fewer injuries per capita than organized soccer in the same age range.\n\nTherefore, American football has a higher injury rate compared to soccer.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Both soccer and American football are considered high-risk sports, but football appears to have higher injury risk. While soccer shows significant injury rates (35.3 injuries per 1000 hours during games), American football is described as 'the most risky sport' with most injuries due to collisions. Football has higher risks of catastrophic injuries, particularly from head contact in blocking and tackling, and poses significant risks of long-term osteoarthritis of the knee and hip from major injuries.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: American football generally has a higher injury rate compared to soccer.\n   - **Support**: Passage 2 mentions that football was ranked as the third most dangerous sport in 2011 by the Bleacher Report, due to the sheer numbers of football-related injuries, with 212,000 children seen in emergency rooms for football injuries in 2009. In contrast, soccer was ranked sixth, with 88,000 soccer players between the ages of 5 and 14 seen in emergency rooms for sports injuries in 2009. This supports the claim.\n\n2. **Claim**: American football is classified as a contact sport with a high risk of injuries, including knee injuries, concussions, and cervical spine injuries.\n   - **Support**: Passage 1 states that football players are more likely to suffer injuries to the cervical spine, which can be catastrophic or life-threatening, and Passage 2 notes that knee injuries are relatively common among football players. This supports the claim.\n\n3. **Claim**: Soccer players are more likely to suffer musculoskeletal injuries to the lower body.\n   - **Support**: Passage 2 indicates that the types of injuries most commonly sustained by soccer players are musculoskeletal injuries to the lower body. This supports the claim.\n\n4. **Claim**: Youth football has a lower injury rate compared to high school, college, and professional levels, with fewer catastrophic injuries.\n   - **Support**: Passage 3 states that the injury rate in Youth Football is less than one-third the injury rate in high school football, less than one-fifth the injury rate in college football, and less than one-ninth the injury rate in professional football. It also mentions that there is an absence of catastrophic head and neck injuries and disruptive joint injuries found at higher levels. This supports the claim.\n\n5. **Claim**: Organized football among 5-15 year-olds has 12% fewer injuries per capita than organized soccer in the same age range.\n   - **Support**: Passage 3 directly states this, providing support for the claim.\n\nGiven the analysis, all claims made in the answer are directly supported by the passages. Therefore, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers the main point from the ground truth that American football has a higher injury rate compared to soccer. It also mentions that both are contact sports with risks of various injuries, which aligns with the ground truth. However, the generated answer introduces specific statistics (e.g., 212,000 children seen in emergency rooms for football injuries, 88,000 soccer players between the ages of 5 and 14 seen in emergency rooms) and rankings of sports by danger (American football as the third most dangerous and soccer as the sixth) that are not present in the ground truth. These statistics and rankings, while potentially relevant to the broader topic of injury rates in sports, do not directly contribute to the comparison of injury rates between soccer and American football as described in the ground truth. The ground truth specifically mentions the injury rate per 1000 hours during games for soccer and describes American football as having higher risks of catastrophic injuries and long-term health issues, which the generated answer does not fully capture.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by stating that American football has a higher injury rate compared to soccer. However, it includes information about the ranking of sports by danger, specific numbers of emergency room visits, and comparisons of injury rates across different age groups and levels of play (youth, high school, college, professional), which, while related to the topic of sports injuries, are not directly relevant to the specific comparison of injury rates between soccer and American football as presented in the ground truth. This additional information makes the answer less focused on the core question.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in stating that American football has a higher injury rate than soccer, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it contains irrelevant information (such as specific injury numbers and sport danger rankings) that does not directly pertain to the comparison as described in the ground truth. Therefore, the answer is correct but includes unnecessary details.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
