  "question": "How do the approaches to experience and age limitations compare between the International Criminal Court's judicial selection and Wellbody Clinic's traditional birth attendant program?",
  "generated_answer": "The documents provided do not contain specific information on age limitations or experience requirements for the Wellbody Clinic's traditional birth attendant program. Therefore, a direct comparison between the International Criminal Court's judicial selection and the Wellbody Clinic's traditional birth attendant program in terms of age limitations and experience requirements cannot be made based on the given information.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The approaches are notably different. The International Criminal Court panel suggests implementing age limits for judges and strictly requires specific types of professional experience, such as courtroom experience for List A candidates, even rejecting candidates with extensive related expertise but without direct involvement in criminal proceedings. In contrast, Wellbody Clinic takes a more inclusive approach with traditional birth attendants, valuing their experience regardless of formal training or age, focusing instead on their community connections and cultural knowledge. The clinic recognizes that TBAs' years of experience in their communities, even without formal medical training, make them valuable assets in providing maternal healthcare services when properly integrated with trained medical staff.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The documents provided do not contain specific information on age limitations or experience requirements for the Wellbody Clinic's traditional birth attendant program.\n   - **Support**: There is no mention of the Wellbody Clinic or its traditional birth attendant program in any of the provided passages. Therefore, the claim that the documents do not contain specific information on this topic is supported by the absence of any relevant information.\n\n2. **Claim**: A direct comparison between the International Criminal Court's judicial selection and the Wellbody Clinic's traditional birth attendant program in terms of age limitations and experience requirements cannot be made based on the given information.\n   - **Support**: Since there is no information provided about the Wellbody Clinic's program, and the passages do discuss aspects of the International Criminal Court's judicial selection (such as experience requirements but not directly age limitations for judges), this claim is also supported. The passages do mention age in the context of retirement and service limits in other contexts (e.g., Passage 4 and Passage 8), but not specifically for the ICC judges in a way that allows for a direct comparison with a non-existent dataset on the Wellbody Clinic.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer's claims are supported by the passages in the sense that they accurately reflect the absence of information regarding the Wellbody Clinic and the specific details about age limitations and experience requirements for the ICC judges that would allow for a comparison.\n\nHowever, the passages do provide some information on age and experience in various legal and judicial contexts, which indirectly supports the notion that such considerations are relevant in legal and professional settings. But since the answer specifically addresses the comparison between the ICC and the Wellbody Clinic, and given that the Wellbody Clinic is not mentioned at all, the support is more about the absence of information than the presence of directly comparative data.\n\nTherefore, considering the continuous scale from -1 to 1, where 1 represents full support and -1 represents no support, the answer's faithfulness to the provided passages would lean towards full support because it correctly identifies the lack of information necessary for a comparison and does not make unsubstantiated claims beyond what the passages provide.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not cover any of the vital information from the ground truth. It states that the documents provided do not contain specific information on age limitations or experience requirements for the Wellbody Clinic's traditional birth attendant program, which directly leads to an inability to compare the two programs as requested by the question. However, the ground truth answer provides detailed information on both programs, indicating that such a comparison can indeed be made. The generated answer fails to address the core of the question, which is how the approaches to experience and age limitations compare between the two programs.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is not directly addressing the question. Instead of providing information or insights into the comparison of the approaches between the International Criminal Court's judicial selection and Wellbody Clinic's traditional birth attendant program, it deflects by stating that the necessary information is not available. This response does not contribute to understanding the differences or similarities between the two programs regarding experience and age limitations.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not provide any relevant information to answer the question. It does not cover the vital information from the ground truth and is not relevant to the question asked. The most fitting evaluation would be that the answer is essentially non-responsive to the query posed, as it does not engage with the substance of the question.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0",
