  "question": "Which system offers better screen resolution support: Elite XTS simulator or Arcam AVR850 receiver?",
  "generated_answer": "The documents provided do not contain specific information about the screen resolution support of the Elite XTS simulator or the Arcam AVR850 receiver. Therefore, I cannot determine which system offers better screen resolution support based on the given information.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Both systems support 4K resolution. The Elite XTS supports Full HD 1080P wide screens and 4K displays, which was an improvement from older versions. Similarly, the Arcam AVR850 features HDMI2.0a with HDCP2.2 4K Ultra HD support.",

Therefore, I cannot determine which system offers better screen resolution support based on the given information.\"\n\nClaim 1: The documents do not contain specific information about the screen resolution support of the Elite XTS simulator.\n- Support: Passage 2 mentions that the Elite XTS supports \"Full HD 1080P wide screens and also 4K,\" which directly addresses its screen resolution support.\n\nClaim 2: The documents do not contain specific information about the screen resolution support of the Arcam AVR850 receiver.\n- Support: Passage 1 and Passage 6 mention that the Arcam AVR850 features \"4K Ultra HD support,\" indicating its screen resolution capability.\n\nClaim 3: The answer cannot determine which system offers better screen resolution support based on the given information.\n- Given the information from Claim 1 and Claim 2, both systems' screen resolution support is mentioned. The Elite XTS supports up to 4K, and the Arcam AVR850 also supports 4K Ultra HD. This implies that both have similar top-end resolution support, but the answer suggests it cannot make this determination due to a lack of information.\n\nBased on the analysis:\n- The answer incorrectly states that the documents do not contain specific information about the screen resolution support of both systems. \n- However, it correctly implies that determining which is \"better\" might be subjective or require more detailed comparison, but this is not the main point of contention since both are capable of 4K resolution.\n\nGiven this, the faithfulness of the answer is compromised because it claims a lack of information where some relevant details are actually provided. However, the critical aspect of comparing which system offers \"better\" screen resolution support is nuanced and not directly answerable based on the passages alone, as both seem to support 4K resolutions.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not provide any specific information about the screen resolution support of either the Elite XTS simulator or the Arcam AVR850 receiver. It states that the documents provided do not contain specific information on this topic, which is incorrect because the ground truth answer explicitly mentions that both systems support 4K resolution and provides additional details about their capabilities (e.g., Full HD 1080P wide screens for the Elite XTS). Therefore, the coverage of vital information from the ground truth in the generated answer is zero, as it fails to mention any relevant details about the screen resolution support of the two systems.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is not directly addressing the question. Instead of providing information about which system offers better screen resolution support or even comparing their resolution support capabilities, it deflects by stating a lack of information in the documents. This response does not contain any unnecessary information related to the question's topic but fails to provide a relevant answer. The question seeks a comparison or statement about the screen resolution capabilities of the two systems, which the generated answer does not deliver.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer falls into the category of \"No answer provided\" because it does not offer any information that addresses the question directly. It claims a lack of information without providing any relevant details that could be used to assess the comparative screen resolution support of the Elite XTS simulator and the Arcam AVR850 receiver.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0.0",
