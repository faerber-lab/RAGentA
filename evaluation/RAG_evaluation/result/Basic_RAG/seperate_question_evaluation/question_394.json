  "ground_truth_answer": "Camera inspection systems evolved in parallel with digital printing technology to maintain quality control. Modern systems use advanced 16K line scan cameras, optimized software, latest PC hardware, and Windows 64-bit operating systems to increase image resolution for detecting smaller defects and perform faster inspections. For example, Lake Image Systems improved their Discovery Multiscan3 software to achieve higher image capture rates and processing speeds. These capabilities mirror the precision quality control seen historically in camera manufacturing, where Leitz used specialized equipment like collimators to check lens flange squareness and projection tests to verify lens definition and focusing accuracy. Both digital inspection systems and traditional camera manufacturing emphasize 100% quality verification - modern systems do this through automated detection of defects like streaks, missing prints and color variations, while historical camera production relied on taking multiple test photographs between 1.25 to 10 meters to verify performance.",
