  "question": "I'm trying to understand oil trade in Southeast Asia - what percentage of global oil demand passes through the Singapore region annually?",
  "generated_answer": "According to the International Energy Agency, the narrow sea lane that runs through the straits of Malacca and Singapore is expected to carry as much as 45% of global crude trade by 2035. This amounts to 16.5 million barrels a day, up from 12 million barrels a day in 2012.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The Singapore region handles $600 billion in annual oil trade, which represents a third of global oil demand",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth answer mentions that the Singapore region handles $600 billion in annual oil trade, which represents a third of global oil demand. The generated answer, however, discusses the percentage of global crude trade expected to be carried through the straits of Malacca and Singapore by 2035 (45%) and provides the amount in barrels per day. It does not directly address the current percentage of global oil demand handled by the Singapore region or mention the $600 billion figure. Therefore, the generated answer lacks coverage of the vital information provided in the ground truth, specifically the current annual oil trade value and its representation of global oil demand.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer does provide information related to oil trade in the Singapore region, discussing future projections of crude oil trade through the straits of Malacca and Singapore. However, it does not directly answer the question about the current percentage of global oil demand passing through the Singapore region annually. The information about the expected increase in crude trade by 2035 and the comparison to 2012 figures, while related to the broader topic of oil trade in Southeast Asia, is not directly relevant to the specific question asked. Thus, the answer contains information that, while related, does not directly address the question's focus on the current situation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not fully cover the vital information from the ground truth and includes information that, while related to the topic, does not directly answer the question. Therefore, it cannot be considered completely correct or directly relevant to the question as posed.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: -1.0",
