  "question": "How did India's economy perform during COVID-19 lockdown and what impact did this have on child marriages?",
  "generated_answer": "I'm sorry, but the provided documents do not contain enough information to directly answer the question about the impact of India's economy during the COVID-19 lockdown on child marriages. The documents discuss various aspects of the economic impact of COVID-19 in India, including the effects on employment, businesses, and the wealth divide, but they do not specifically address the issue of child marriages in relation to the economic downturn caused by the lockdown.\n\nTo answer this question accurately, one would need additional information or data that specifically examines the relationship between the economic conditions during the lockdown and the incidence of child marriages in India. This would likely involve analyzing trends in child marriages before and after the lockdown, as well as considering factors such as economic hardship, government policies, and social changes that may have influenced the practice during this period.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "India's economy contracted by almost 24% in one quarter during the lockdown. This economic downturn, combined with millions of daily laborers and migrant workers losing their jobs, pushed many families into poverty. As a result, millions of families felt forced to consider child marriage as a way to alleviate poverty, threatening India's previous progress as a world leader in reducing child marriages.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "The answer states that the provided documents do not contain enough information to directly answer the question about the impact of India's economy during the COVID-19 lockdown on child marriages. This claim is supported by the passages, as none of them explicitly discuss the relationship between the economic impact of the lockdown and child marriages.\n\nThe answer also mentions that the documents discuss various aspects of the economic impact of COVID-19 in India, including the effects on employment, businesses, and the wealth divide. This claim is supported by passages such as Passage 1, Passage 5, and Passage 6, which discuss the economic impact of the lockdown on India.\n\nAdditionally, the answer suggests that to answer the question accurately, one would need additional information or data that specifically examines the relationship between the economic conditions during the lockdown and the incidence of child marriages in India. This claim is reasonable, given the lack of explicit discussion of child marriages in the provided passages.\n\nHowever, Passage 2 does discuss child marriage as a social issue with economic implications, but it does not specifically address the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on child marriages.\n\nOverall, the answer's claims are supported by the passages, but the passages do not provide enough information to fully answer the question.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.5",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not provide any specific information about how India's economy performed during the COVID-19 lockdown or its impact on child marriages. It states that the provided documents do not contain enough information to directly answer the question, which means it lacks coverage of the vital information present in the ground truth answer. The ground truth answer provides specific details about the economic contraction, the impact on employment, and how these factors led to an increase in child marriages. In contrast, the generated answer does not offer any data or insights into these areas, resulting in poor coverage.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is somewhat relevant in the sense that it acknowledges the question and explains why it cannot be answered based on the provided documents. However, it does not directly address the question or provide any relevant information that could help understand the impact of the COVID-19 lockdown on India's economy and child marriages. The information about needing additional data to analyze trends in child marriages and considering factors like economic hardship is relevant to researching the topic but does not constitute a direct answer to the question posed.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not provide any correct information about the specific question asked. It does not cover the vital information from the ground truth and does not directly address the question with relevant information. The closest score based on the provided scale would reflect that the answer does not provide any useful information to answer the question.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0",
