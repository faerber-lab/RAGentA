  "question": "callipyge sheep muscle food efficiency",
  "generated_answer": "The callipyge mutation in sheep has been shown to enable the sheep to convert food into muscle 30% more efficiently than normal sheep. This increased muscle growth and improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) make callipyge sheep more food-efficient compared to non-callipyge sheep.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Sheep with the callipyge gene can convert food into muscle 30% more efficiently than normal sheep.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The callipyge mutation in sheep enables them to convert food into muscle 30% more efficiently than normal sheep.\n   - **Support**: This claim is directly supported by Passage 2, which states, \"The callipyge gene could prove beneficial in breeding because it enables the sheep to convert food into muscle 30% more efficiently than normal sheep.\"\n\n2. **Claim**: This increased muscle growth and improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) make callipyge sheep more food-efficient compared to non-callipyge sheep.\n   - **Support**: While Passage 2 mentions the increased efficiency in converting food into muscle, it does not explicitly discuss the feed conversion ratio (FCR) in the context of callipyge sheep. However, the concept of improved feed efficiency can be inferred from the mention of converting food into muscle more efficiently. Direct information on FCR in relation to callipyge sheep is not provided in the passages.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer has direct support from the passages for the claim regarding the 30% increased efficiency in converting food into muscle. However, the mention of improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) as a reason for callipyge sheep being more food-efficient, while plausible and related to the concept of efficiency, does not have explicit support in the provided passages regarding the specific term \"FCR.\"\n\nConsidering the direct support for one claim and the lack of explicit support for the specifics of another, but recognizing the overall concept of efficiency is supported, the faithfulness score would lean towards partial support.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.5",
  "correctness_score": 2.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer mentions that the callipyge mutation in sheep enables them to convert food into muscle 30% more efficiently than normal sheep. This directly aligns with the ground truth answer, which states that sheep with the callipyge gene can convert food into muscle 30% more efficiently than normal sheep. Therefore, the vital information from the ground truth regarding the efficiency improvement is fully covered in the generated answer.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about the callipyge sheep's muscle food efficiency. It provides the specific detail about the 30% increase in efficiency, which is the core of the question. Additionally, it mentions the improved feed conversion ratio (FCR) and increased muscle growth, which are relevant consequences of the callipyge mutation. However, these additional details could be considered slightly beyond the exact scope of the question, which only asks about food efficiency. Despite this, they are closely related and help to reinforce the answer's relevance by providing context on why the callipyge sheep are more food-efficient.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct and directly relevant to the question. It fully covers the vital information from the ground truth and provides additional relevant context that enhances the understanding of the callipyge sheep's food efficiency without diverting into unnecessary information.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
