There is no contradictory information in the other passages regarding these specific claims, and the answer does not make claims that are unsupported by the passages.\n\nTherefore, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported by the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the two key aspects: coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers all the vital information present in the ground truth answer. It mentions the United Nations' declaration of fundamental values essential for sustainable development and international relations in the twenty-first century and lists the same six values: freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared responsibility. This indicates that the generated answer has a high level of coverage, as it includes all the specific values mentioned in the ground truth.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing the specific values declared by the United Nations as essential for sustainable development. However, it also includes some additional information, such as the reference to the United Nations General Assembly, the year \"2000\", and a broader context about people's sustainability values driving attitudes and behaviors towards the sustainable development of globalization. While this additional information is related to the topic of sustainable development and the United Nations, it is not strictly necessary to answer the question about the specific values important for sustainable development as declared by the UN.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in terms of the information it provides about the values important for sustainable development as declared by the United Nations. However, it contains some additional, albeit related, information that is not directly requested by the question. This means the answer is not completely concise or directly to the point as the ground truth answer but still conveys all the necessary information accurately.\n\nTherefore, the generated answer should be scored as correct but containing some irrelevant information, which aligns with a score of 1.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
