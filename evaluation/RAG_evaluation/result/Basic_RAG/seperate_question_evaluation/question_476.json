  "question": "What are the specific water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) for Parylene-N, Parylene-C, and Parylene-D in terms of g.mm/m2.day?",
  "generated_answer": "The water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) for Parylene-N, Parylene-C, and Parylene-D are 0.59 g.mm/m2.day, 0.08 g.mm/m2.day, and 0.09 g.mm/m2.day, respectively.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "According to the data, Parylene-N has a water vapor transmission rate of 0.59 g.mm/m2.day, Parylene-C has 0.08 g.mm/m2.day, and Parylene-D has 0.09 g.mm/m2.day.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claims made in the answer and check if they are supported by the passages.\n\nThe answer claims: \"The water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) for Parylene-N, Parylene-C, and Parylene-D are 0.59 g.mm/m2.day, 0.08 g.mm/m2.day, and 0.09 g.mm/m2.day, respectively.\"\n\nUpon reviewing the passages, we find that Passage 1, specifically Table I, provides the water vapor transmission rates for Parylene-N, Parylene-C, and Parylene-D as 0.59, 0.08, and 0.09 (g.mm)/(m2.day), respectively. This directly supports the claims made in the answer.\n\nSince all claims in the answer are directly supported by the passages, specifically Passage 1, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": 2.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The question asks for the specific water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) for Parylene-N, Parylene-C, and Parylene-D in terms of g.mm/m2.day. The generated answer provides the WVTR values for all three types of Parylene (N, C, and D) as 0.59 g.mm/m2.day, 0.08 g.mm/m2.day, and 0.09 g.mm/m2.day, respectively. This matches the information given in the ground truth answer. Therefore, the generated answer covers all the vital information requested in the question.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing the specific WVTR values for each type of Parylene without including any unnecessary or irrelevant information. It stays focused on the query and does not divert into unrelated topics or provide extra details not asked for.\n\nGiven these observations, the generated answer is both comprehensive in terms of covering the requested information and relevant as it directly answers the question without any superfluous details.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
