  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The boundary between Canada and Montana is located to the north of Montana.\n   - **Support**: This claim is supported by Passage 1, which states, \"The boundary between Canada and Montana is located to the north of Montana.\"\n\n2. **Claim**: Montana has borders with North Dakota and South Dakota to its east and South Dakota to its southeast.\n   - **Support**: This claim is partially supported by Passage 1, which mentions Montana having borders with North Dakota and South Dakota to its east but does not specify South Dakota to the southeast. It does mention Wyoming to the south and Idaho to the west, extending along its southern boundary.\n\n3. **Claim**: The answer does not directly address the question about the Montana-Idaho wildlife corridor distance.\n   - **Support**: There is no direct support for the specific question about the distance of the Montana-Idaho wildlife corridor in the provided answer. However, Passage 1 discusses distances between Idaho and Montana in terms of driving and flying, and Passage 5 mentions a trail length along the Idaho/Montana border, but neither directly answers the question about a wildlife corridor distance.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer partially addresses geographical relationships between Montana and its neighboring states, including Idaho, but fails to directly address the question about the Montana-Idaho wildlife corridor distance. The passages provide some relevant information about distances and borders but do not specifically focus on a \"wildlife corridor distance\" between Montana and Idaho.\n\nTherefore, considering the answer provides some relevant geographical information but does not directly address the question about the wildlife corridor distance, the faithfulness score would reflect partial support.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth answer provides specific information about the wildlife corridor distance between Montana and Idaho, mentioning the Centennial Valley and giving exact distances (463 kilometers or 288 miles by air, and 774 kilometers or 481 miles by driving). In contrast, the generated answer does not mention the wildlife corridor or provide any distances between Montana and Idaho. Instead, it discusses the geographical location of Montana in relation to other states and Canada. Therefore, the generated answer lacks coverage of the vital information present in the ground truth.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The question specifically asks about the \"montana idaho wildlife corridor distance,\" which implies the need for information related to the distance or specifics of a wildlife corridor between Montana and Idaho. The generated answer, however, talks about Montana's borders with other states and its geographical position without addressing the wildlife corridor or distance between Montana and Idaho. This makes the generated answer irrelevant to the question asked.\n\nGiven these observations, the generated answer fails to provide any correct or relevant information regarding the question about the Montana-Idaho wildlife corridor distance. It does not cover any vital information from the ground truth and is not relevant to the question asked.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: -1.0",
