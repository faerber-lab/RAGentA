  "ground_truth_answer": "Both conditions show early signs in infancy or childhood. Fetal alcohol syndrome signs include shorter/thinner stature, smaller head size, smooth philtrum (ridge between nose and mouth), and challenges with coordination, attention, and memory. Cerebral palsy primarily manifests through movement difficulties, with three types: spastic CP causing muscle stiffness, athetoid CP causing involuntary movements, and ataxic CP leading to balance and depth perception problems.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "The generated answer is: \"I don't have enough information to answer your question.\"\n\nTo evaluate the faithfulness of this answer, let's analyze the claims made and check if they are supported by the passages.\n\nThe question asks about \"early symptoms fetal alcohol cerebral palsy\". The answer claims that it doesn't have enough information to answer the question.\n\nHowever, upon reviewing the passages, we can see that there is information related to fetal alcohol syndrome and cerebral palsy. Passages 1, 2, 7, and 9 discuss fetal alcohol syndrome, its causes, symptoms, and effects. Passages 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10 discuss cerebral palsy, its symptoms, causes, and effects.\n\nWhile the passages provide information on both topics, they do not explicitly link fetal alcohol syndrome to cerebral palsy as a direct cause. However, Passage 8 mentions that \"Drugs and Alcohol\" are a major cause of cerebral palsy, and Passage 2 discusses the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure on the developing fetus, which can lead to fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD).\n\nGiven that the passages provide some relevant information, but the answer claims that it doesn't have enough information, the faithfulness score would be negative, as the answer does not accurately reflect the content of the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: -1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the process step by step, considering the aspects of coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks for early symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome and cerebral palsy. This implies the answer should include signs or symptoms that are observable early in life (infancy or childhood) for both conditions.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Ground Truth Answer**: The ground truth provides specific early signs for both conditions. For fetal alcohol syndrome, these include physical characteristics (shorter/thinner stature, smaller head size, smooth philtrum) and developmental challenges (coordination, attention, and memory issues). For cerebral palsy, the primary manifestations are movement difficulties, categorized into three types: spastic, athetoid, and ataxic, each with distinct symptoms.\n\n3. **Evaluating the Generated Answer**: The generated answer states, \"I don't have enough information to answer your question.\" This response does not provide any information related to the early symptoms of fetal alcohol syndrome or cerebral palsy.\n\n4. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not cover any portion of the vital information from the ground truth. It fails to mention any symptoms, signs, or characteristics of either condition.\n\n5. **Relevance**: The answer is not directly addressing the question. Instead of providing relevant information or even irrelevant information, it claims a lack of information, which does not contribute to answering the query.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the generated answer does not provide any relevant information and does not attempt to address the question with either correct or incorrect information related to the topic, it falls into the category of \"No answer provided.\"\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0\n\nNOTE: Correctness score adjusted to -1 because faithfulness score is -1 (answer is not supported by the provided passages).",
