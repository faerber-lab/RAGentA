  "ground_truth_answer": "The basic movements for beginner dressage include performing medium and free walk, executing a square halt from medium walk, transitioning to working trot, trotting straight up the center line, and trotting on a 20-meter circle. For grooming preparations, the horse must be bathed several days before the show to allow natural oils to create shine, followed by clipping of feathery leg hair and long hairs on the throat, face, muzzle, and ears. The mane needs to be braided and tied into loops with matching yarn for a button effect. Additionally, the hooves should be polished with either clear or black polish depending on their color.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down each claim and check if it's supported by the passages.\n\n1. **Basic movements needed for beginner dressage competitions:**\n   - Riding the medium walk and the free walk\n   - Bringing the horse to a square halt from the medium walk\n   - Transitioning into a working trot\n   - Trotting straight up the center line\n   - Trotting on a 20-meter circle\n\n   These movements are directly supported by PASSAGE 3, which lists them as part of the \"Dressage Movements Checklist\" for being ready to compete.\n\n2. **Grooming preparations essential before the show:**\n   - Bathing the horse a few days prior to the competition\n   - Clipping the horse's feathery hair on the legs, throat, face, muzzle, and ears, and creating a clean path for the bridle\n   - Deciding on the mane style (braiding or leaving it down) and tying it off neatly if braided\n   - Applying a polish to the horse's hooves to make them shine\n\n   These grooming preparations are supported by PASSAGE 4, which details the steps for preparing a British Riding Pony for a show, including bathing, clipping, mane styling, and polishing hooves. Similar grooming advice is also found in PASSAGE 1, which mentions bathing, clipping, and braiding or banding the mane, although it's more general and not specific to dressage.\n\nGiven the analysis, all claims in the answer are directly supported by the passages, particularly PASSAGE 3 for the dressage movements and PASSAGE 4 (with additional support from PASSAGE 1) for the grooming preparations.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the comparison with the ground truth answer step by step, focusing on coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Basic Movements for Beginner Dressage:**\n   - The generated answer correctly lists the basic movements needed for beginner dressage competitions, including riding the medium walk and the free walk, bringing the horse to a square halt from the medium walk, transitioning into a working trot, trotting straight up the center line, and trotting on a 20-meter circle. This matches the information provided in the ground truth answer.\n   - **Coverage:** The generated answer fully covers the basic movements aspect of the question.\n   - **Relevance:** The information provided is directly relevant to the question about basic movements.\n\n2. **Grooming Preparations:**\n   - The generated answer mentions bathing the horse a few days prior to the competition, clipping the horse's feathery hair on the legs, throat, face, muzzle, and ears, deciding on the mane style (braiding or leaving it down) and tying it off neatly if braided, and applying a polish to the horse's hooves.\n   - **Coverage:** While the generated answer covers most of the grooming preparations, it lacks specificity in a few areas compared to the ground truth. For example, it does not specify that the mane needs to be braided and tied into loops with matching yarn for a button effect, nor does it mention the color of the polish (clear or black) depending on the hooves' color.\n   - **Relevance:** The information provided is relevant to grooming preparations but lacks some details.\n\n3. **Overall Assessment:**\n   - The generated answer is largely correct and directly addresses the question without unnecessary information. However, it misses some specific details regarding grooming preparations that are mentioned in the ground truth answer.\n   - Given the high level of coverage and relevance, but acknowledging the lack of complete detail in grooming preparations, the score should reflect a strong correctness but not perfection.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.8",
