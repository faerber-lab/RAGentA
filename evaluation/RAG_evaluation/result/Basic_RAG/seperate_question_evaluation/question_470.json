  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claims made in the answer and check if they are supported by the passages.\n\nThe answer claims: \"Odell Brewing Company currently operates two different brewhouse systems in their facilities: a 50-barrel system and a 5-barrel pilot system.\"\n\n1. **Claim about the 50-barrel system**: This claim is partially supported. In Passage 1, it mentions a \"50-barrel Specific Mechanical brewhouse,\" which directly supports the existence of a 50-barrel system. However, Passage 3 mentions that the 50-barrel system is \"currently mothballed and for sale,\" which suggests it might not be in operation at the time the passage was written.\n\n2. **Claim about the 5-barrel pilot system**: This claim is supported. Passage 3 explicitly mentions that Odell Brewing \"still operates a five-barrel 'pilot system' in order to experiment and test new beer ideas -- and to brew small-batch beers in its tap room or in collaboration with bars and other businesses.\" This directly supports the claim about the 5-barrel pilot system being in operation.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer has partial support because it correctly identifies the two brewhouse systems (50-barrel and 5-barrel pilot system) as being part of Odell Brewing Company's facilities at some point. However, the status of the 50-barrel system (whether it is currently in operation or mothballed) is not consistently clear across the passages, which introduces a degree of uncertainty.\n\nTherefore, the faithfulness score would reflect that the answer is mostly correct but lacks complete accuracy due to the potential discrepancy in the operational status of the 50-barrel system.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.5",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the comparison with the ground truth answer based on the aspects of coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth answer mentions that Odell Brewing Company operates three brewhouse systems - a 10 barrel pilot system, a 15 barrel system, and a 150 BBL main brewhouse. In contrast, the generated answer states that Odell Brewing Company operates two different brewhouse systems: a 50-barrel system and a 5-barrel pilot system. None of the systems mentioned in the generated answer match the specifics of the ground truth answer. The generated answer fails to cover the actual number and sizes of the brewhouse systems as provided in the ground truth. Thus, the coverage is poor.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing information about the brewhouse systems operated by Odell Brewing Company. However, the information provided is incorrect and does not match the ground truth. There is no unnecessary or irrelevant information in the generated answer regarding the question asked; it simply provides incorrect details. Therefore, while the answer is directly relevant to the question, its relevance is compromised by its inaccuracy.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not accurately reflect the ground truth. It incorrectly states the number and sizes of the brewhouse systems, indicating a significant lack of coverage of vital information. Since the answer is directly addressing the question but provides incorrect information, it falls into the category of an incorrect answer.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: -1.0",
