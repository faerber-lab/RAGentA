  "question": "What is the difference between Chiltern Railways and Eurowings' approaches to WiFi connectivity limitations in their transportation services?",
  "generated_answer": "Chiltern Railways offers free Wi-Fi connectivity on stations and trains, with no data limitations mentioned in the documents. Passengers can authenticate once and access the Wi-Fi network seamlessly between the station and the train.\n\nEurowings, on the other hand, provides paid Wi-Fi services with data packages that have time limits and data limits depending on the package chosen. Passengers can purchase data packages for internet access beyond the free services provided, such as checking flight information and accessing offers from Eurowings partners.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Chiltern Railways provides free WiFi with incrementally increased data allowances from 20MB to 125MB over a 40-week period on their train routes. In contrast, Eurowings implements a tiered paid WiFi system with three different packages: Chat (up to 150 kbps), Connect 30/60 (up to 1.5 Mbps), and Connect Premium (up to 1.5 Mbps), with prices varying based on flight duration (less or more than two hours).",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the comparison between Chiltern Railways and Eurowings' approaches to WiFi connectivity limitations as described in the ground truth and the generated answer.\n\n1. **Coverage of Chiltern Railways' WiFi Policy**: The ground truth mentions that Chiltern Railways provides free WiFi with incrementally increased data allowances from 20MB to 125MB over a 40-week period. In contrast, the generated answer states that Chiltern Railways offers free Wi-Fi connectivity with no data limitations mentioned. This indicates a significant lack of coverage because the generated answer fails to mention the specific data allowances and the incremental increase over time, which are crucial details for understanding Chiltern Railways' WiFi policy.\n\n2. **Coverage of Eurowings' WiFi Policy**: The ground truth describes Eurowings' tiered paid WiFi system with three different packages (Chat, Connect 30/60, and Connect Premium) and mentions that prices vary based on flight duration. The generated answer mentions that Eurowings provides paid Wi-Fi services with data packages that have time limits and data limits, depending on the package chosen, but it does not specify the details of the packages or the pricing structure based on flight duration. This shows a partial coverage, as it acknowledges the paid nature and variability of the service but lacks specific details.\n\n3. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by comparing the WiFi approaches of Chiltern Railways and Eurowings without introducing unnecessary information. However, the lack of specific details, especially regarding Chiltern Railways' incremental data allowances and Eurowings' detailed package offerings, reduces the answer's relevance to the question asked.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is incorrect because it fails to accurately represent the WiFi connectivity limitations and policies of both Chiltern Railways and Eurowings as described in the ground truth. The omission of critical details, such as the incremental data increase for Chiltern Railways and the specific packages for Eurowings, makes the answer incomplete and misleading.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: -1.0",
