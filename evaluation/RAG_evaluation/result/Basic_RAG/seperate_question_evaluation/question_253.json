  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: A Habanero Margarita typically includes habanero-infused tequila, lime juice, orange liqueur (such as Cointreau or Triple Sec), agave nectar or simple syrup, and ice.\n   - **Support**: Passage 1 mentions habanero peppers and lime juice in the context of a margarita mix, but it doesn't specify the use of orange liqueur or agave nectar. Passage 2 discusses a margarita with habanero tequila, lemon juice, agave nectar, and green juice, which partially supports the claim. Passage 10 provides a recipe for a Habanero Margarita that includes habanero-infused tequila, Triple Sec, and implies the use of lime juice (though the full recipe is not provided), offering partial support.\n\n2. **Claim**: The proportions for a Habanero Margarita can vary, but a common starting point might be 2 oz habanero-infused tequila, 1 oz lime juice, 1 oz orange liqueur, and 1/2 oz agave nectar or simple syrup.\n   - **Support**: Passage 10 provides a partial recipe for a Habanero Margarita with specific proportions (1 \u00bc oz habanero-infused tequila, \u00be oz Triple Sec, but the amount of lime juice is not fully specified), which partially supports the claim about variable proportions but does not exactly match the proportions given in the answer.\n\n3. **Claim**: To make a Habanero Margarita, you would typically infuse tequila with habanero peppers to give it a spicy kick.\n   - **Support**: Passage 8 mentions infusing tequila with chiles (which could include habaneros) to make a spicy margarita, and Passage 10 explicitly describes making habanero tequila by infusing seeded sliced habaneros, directly supporting this claim.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer provides some claims that are directly supported by the passages (especially regarding the infusion of tequila with habaneros and the general ingredients of a margarita), but other claims (such as the specific proportions of ingredients) are either partially supported or not directly supported by the passages provided.\n\n**FINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.5**",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the key components and compare them to the ground truth.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth provides specific proportions for a habanero margarita recipe, including 1 \u00bc oz. habanero infused tequila, \u00be oz. Triple Sec, \u00bd oz. lime juice, and mentions sweet and sour mix and salt for the rim. The generated answer, however, does not provide these exact proportions. Instead, it offers a general guideline with different proportions (2 oz habanero-infused tequila, 1 oz lime juice, 1 oz orange liqueur, 1/2 oz agave nectar or simple syrup) and does not mention sweet and sour mix or salt for the rim. Thus, the generated answer lacks specific coverage of the vital information provided in the ground truth.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is attempting to address the question by providing a recipe for a habanero margarita. However, it includes unnecessary information, such as the process of infusing tequila with habanero peppers and a general discussion on adjusting proportions to taste. While this information might be useful in a broader context, it does not directly answer the question about specific ingredient proportions as requested.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does provide some relevant information about making a habanero margarita but fails to match the specificity and detail of the ground truth. It includes unnecessary information and does not cover the exact proportions or all the ingredients mentioned in the ground truth.\n\nSince the generated answer contains some correct elements related to the question (like the inclusion of habanero-infused tequila, lime juice, and an orange liqueur), but lacks the exact proportions and includes irrelevant information, it falls into the category of being correct but containing irrelevant information.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
