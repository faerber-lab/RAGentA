  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The provided documents do not contain enough specific information to answer the question about what makes a product creatively basic requirements.\n   - **Support**: Passages 1 through 10 discuss various aspects of product development, requirements, and design, but none directly address what makes a product \"creatively basic\" in terms of requirements. Passage 7 talks about product design considering functional beauty, form, and people's spiritual needs, which might relate to creativity but doesn't directly answer the question about basic requirements.\n\n2. **Claim**: The documents cover a wide range of topics related to product development, marketing, and requirements.\n   - **Support**: This is supported by the passages. For example, Passage 1 discusses product requirement templates, Passage 2 talks about product requirements documents, Passage 3 mentions custom development and its process, and Passage 10 discusses advertising and its objectives.\n\n3. **Claim**: The documents do not specifically address the creative aspects or basic requirements that make a product creative.\n   - **Support**: This claim is also supported. While passages like 7 and 9 touch upon aspects of product design and development that could be considered creative (like aesthetics and meeting specific customer requirements), none explicitly define what makes a product's requirements \"creatively basic.\"\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer's claims are largely supported by the passages. The passages do indeed cover a broad spectrum of topics related to product development and marketing but do not specifically address the question of what makes a product's requirements creatively basic. Therefore, the answer accurately reflects the content and limitations of the provided passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not provide any information regarding the characteristics that make a product creative, such as novelty/originality, value/utility, or the ability to create emotion, which are mentioned in the ground truth answer. Therefore, the coverage of vital information from the ground truth is 0%, as none of the essential points are addressed.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer states that the provided documents do not contain enough specific information to answer the question. While this might be a valid reason for not being able to provide a detailed answer, it does not directly address the question about what makes a product creative in terms of basic requirements. The answer focuses on the lack of information in the documents rather than attempting to provide any relevant insight into the question itself. Thus, the answer is not directly relevant to the question asked.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not provide any correct information regarding the question and instead focuses on the unavailability of specific information in the documents. This aligns with the description of a score of 0, which indicates that no answer was provided to the question asked.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0",
