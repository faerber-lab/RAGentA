  "question": "aluminum copper wiring safety sizing requirements",
  "generated_answer": "Based on the provided documents, aluminum wiring can pose safety risks due to its tendency to oxidize, expand and contract more than copper, and its incompatibility with copper devices and connectors. Aluminum wiring can lead to loose connections, overheating, sparks, and potentially house fires.\n\nCopper wiring, on the other hand, is considered safer due to its superior conductivity, durability, and resistance to corrosion. Copper wiring is also more compatible with electrical devices and connectors.\n\nWhen it comes to sizing requirements, the National Electrical Code (NEC) provides guidelines for the size of conductors based on the service or feeder rating. For example, for a 200-amp service, the NEC recommends #2/0 AWG copper conductors or #4/0 AWG aluminum or copper-clad aluminum conductors.\n\nHowever, the documents do not provide specific information on the safety sizing requirements for aluminum versus copper wiring. It is important to consult the NEC or a licensed electrician for accurate and up-to-date information on wiring safety and sizing requirements.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Aluminum wiring, used extensively between 1962-1972 due to high copper prices, poses safety concerns as it oxidizes over time, increasing electrical resistance and fire hazards. To address these risks, special anti-oxidizing paste and proper terminals are required. For copper installations, the equipment grounding conductor must be sized based on the overcurrent protection device rating (e.g., a 450A device requires 2 AWG copper), while the grounded conductor (neutral) must be sized to handle 100% of the calculated neutral load, with special considerations for nonlinear loads exceeding 50%.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Aluminum wiring poses safety risks due to its tendency to oxidize, expand and contract more than copper, and its incompatibility with copper devices and connectors.**\n   - Supported by Passage 1, Passage 2, and Passage 3, which mention oxidation, expansion, and compatibility issues with aluminum wiring.\n\n2. **Aluminum wiring can lead to loose connections, overheating, sparks, and potentially house fires.**\n   - Supported by Passage 1, Passage 2, Passage 3, and Passage 6, which all discuss the potential for fires and other safety hazards due to aluminum wiring.\n\n3. **Copper wiring is considered safer due to its superior conductivity, durability, and resistance to corrosion.**\n   - Supported by Passage 2 and Passage 9, which highlight the advantages of copper wiring over aluminum.\n\n4. **The National Electrical Code (NEC) provides guidelines for the size of conductors based on the service or feeder rating.**\n   - Supported by Passage 5 and Passage 10, which reference NEC guidelines for conductor sizing.\n\n5. **For a 200-amp service, the NEC recommends #2/0 AWG copper conductors or #4/0 AWG aluminum or copper-clad aluminum conductors.**\n   - Directly supported by Passage 10, which provides a table with NEC recommendations for service entrance conductors.\n\n6. **The documents do not provide specific information on the safety sizing requirements for aluminum versus copper wiring.**\n   - This claim is partially supported because while the passages discuss safety concerns and sizing requirements, they do not comprehensively compare safety sizing requirements for aluminum and copper in all contexts.\n\nGiven the analysis, most claims in the answer are directly supported by the passages. However, the answer also mentions a lack of specific information on safety sizing requirements, which is a nuanced point that reflects the complexity of the topic but does not fully capture the comparative safety discussions present across the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.8",
  "correctness_score": 1.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the key components of the question and compare them with the information provided in the generated answer.\n\n1. **Aluminum Wiring Safety Concerns**: The generated answer correctly identifies that aluminum wiring poses safety risks due to its tendency to oxidize, expand, and contract more than copper, and its incompatibility with copper devices and connectors. This matches the ground truth, which mentions oxidation as a cause for increased electrical resistance and fire hazards. However, the generated answer does not specifically mention the need for special anti-oxidizing paste and proper terminals as required by the ground truth.\n\n2. **Copper Wiring Safety**: The generated answer states that copper wiring is safer due to its superior conductivity, durability, and resistance to corrosion, which aligns with general knowledge but does not directly address the sizing requirements for safety.\n\n3. **Sizing Requirements**: The generated answer provides some information on sizing based on the National Electrical Code (NEC) for a 200-amp service but does not directly address the specific requirements mentioned in the ground truth, such as sizing the equipment grounding conductor based on the overcurrent protection device rating or handling 100% of the calculated neutral load for the grounded conductor. It also mentions that the documents do not provide specific information on safety sizing requirements for aluminum versus copper wiring, which indicates a lack of coverage of vital information from the ground truth.\n\n4. **Relevance and Coverage**: The generated answer contains relevant information about the safety concerns of aluminum wiring and the general safety of copper wiring. However, it lacks specific details on sizing requirements as outlined in the ground truth, particularly for copper installations. The answer also includes a statement about consulting the NEC or a licensed electrician, which, while prudent, does not directly address the question's request for information on safety sizing requirements.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is partially correct and relevant but lacks crucial details about sizing requirements as specified in the ground truth. It also introduces the recommendation to consult the NEC or a licensed electrician, which, although useful, does not contribute to answering the question directly.\n\nGiven the analysis, the generated answer falls short of providing complete and directly relevant information as requested by the question. Therefore, it does not achieve a perfect score but is not entirely incorrect either.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
