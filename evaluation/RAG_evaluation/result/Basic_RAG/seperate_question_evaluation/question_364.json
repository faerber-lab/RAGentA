  "generated_answer": "I don't have enough information to provide a specific age for the ancient modern caves formation.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Caves vary greatly in age and formation periods. The Hato caves in Curacao are extremely ancient, formed in fossil coral reefs at least 900,000 years old when the area was underwater. In contrast, some Hawaiian caves are much younger - the Kula Kai Caverns were created by volcanic eruptions within the last 1,000 years, while others like the Kaneana Cave on Oahu are around 150,000 years old, representing different geological periods and formation processes.",

This suggests that while the answer does not make any claims that are directly contradicted by the passages, it also does not utilize the information given to make a more informed statement about the age of cave formations.\n\nTherefore, the faithfulness of the answer, considering it does not make any false claims but also does not leverage the provided information to offer insight into the age of cave formations, would be somewhere in the middle.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer states, \"I don't have enough information to provide a specific age for the ancient modern caves formation.\" This response does not cover any of the vital information provided in the ground truth answer. The ground truth discusses the wide range of ages for different caves, providing specific examples such as the Hato caves in Curacao being at least 900,000 years old and the Kula Kai Caverns in Hawaii being formed within the last 1,000 years. The generated answer does not mention any specific ages, formation periods, or examples of caves, resulting in very poor coverage of the topic.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The question asks about the age of ancient modern cave formations. The generated answer directly addresses the question by stating its inability to provide a specific age, which is relevant to the question asked. However, it does not provide any useful information towards answering the question, making it relevant but not helpful.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not provide any correct information about the ages of cave formations, which is the core of the question. It acknowledges a lack of information but does not attempt to provide any relevant details or examples that could partially address the question. Therefore, the answer is not correct in the context of providing meaningful information about the topic.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0",
