  "question": "How do packing requirements compare between dry stone walls and rendered cladding on timber frames?",
  "generated_answer": "The documents provided do not contain specific information on packing requirements for dry stone walls compared to rendered cladding on timber frames. Therefore, I don't have enough information to answer this question accurately.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "In dry stone walls, packing (also called hearting) is crucial and has specific requirements - it must be done carefully with the largest pieces possible, placed as flat as possible, and done as you go without stacking more than one course of stone without hearting. In contrast, for rendered cladding on timber frames, packing is not mentioned as a requirement - instead, the focus is on ensuring proper ventilation and drainage in the cavity between the timber frame and external cladding, along with appropriate movement gaps that can accommodate differential movement while maintaining adequate cavity ventilation.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "The answer states that the documents provided do not contain specific information on packing requirements for dry stone walls compared to rendered cladding on timber frames. To evaluate the faithfulness of this answer, we need to check if the passages provide any information on packing requirements for dry stone walls and rendered cladding on timber frames.\n\nUpon analyzing the passages, we find that:\n\n* PASSAGE 6 and PASSAGE 9 mention dry stone wall panels and cladding, but they do not provide information on packing requirements.\n* PASSAGE 1, PASSAGE 2, PASSAGE 4, PASSAGE 7, and PASSAGE 8 discuss timber frame construction, cladding, and related topics, but they do not mention packing requirements for dry stone walls or rendered cladding on timber frames.\n* None of the passages provide a direct comparison of packing requirements between dry stone walls and rendered cladding on timber frames.\n\nSince the passages do not contain specific information on packing requirements for dry stone walls compared to rendered cladding on timber frames, the answer's claim is supported by the lack of relevant information in the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not provide any information regarding the packing requirements for dry stone walls or rendered cladding on timber frames. It states that the documents provided do not contain specific information on this topic, which directly implies that the answer does not cover any portion of the vital information present in the ground truth. The ground truth provides detailed comparisons and requirements for both dry stone walls and rendered cladding on timber frames, none of which is included in the generated answer. Therefore, the coverage is 0%.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is not directly addressing the question. Instead of providing information or comparisons related to packing requirements between the two construction methods, it deflects by stating a lack of information in the provided documents. This response does not contain any relevant information that would help answer the question posed. The question specifically asks for a comparison, and the generated answer fails to deliver any form of comparison or relevant insight.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer falls into the category of not providing an answer, as it does not address the question with any relevant or correct information. It simply states that there's not enough information to answer the question accurately, without attempting to provide any insight or comparison based on general knowledge or understanding of the topic.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0.0",
