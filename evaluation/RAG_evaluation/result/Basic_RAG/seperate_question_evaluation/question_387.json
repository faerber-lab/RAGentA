  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claims made in the answer and check if they are supported by the passages.\n\n1. **Claim: The Jog Falls in India are 829 feet tall.**\n   - **Support:** PASSAGE 1, PASSAGE 2, PASSAGE 6, and PASSAGE 10 all mention that Jog Falls is 829 feet tall. Therefore, this claim is fully supported.\n\n2. **Claim: The four distinct cascades are known as Raja, Rani, Roarer, and Rocket.**\n   - **Support:** PASSAGE 1, PASSAGE 2, and PASSAGE 10 explicitly mention the names of the four cascades as Raja, Rani, Roarer, and Rocket. Thus, this claim is also fully supported.\n\nGiven that both claims in the answer are directly supported by multiple passages, the faithfulness of the answer is at its highest level.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": -1.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The question asks for the height of the Jog Falls in India and the names of its four distinct cascades. The generated answer provides the height as 829 feet and lists the cascades as Raja, Rani, Roarer, and Rocket. However, the height provided in the generated answer (829 feet) does not match the height given in the ground truth answer (956 feet). Despite this discrepancy, the generated answer does cover the two main points of the question: it gives a height (albeit incorrect) and correctly names the four cascades. Thus, in terms of coverage, the answer is partially correct but contains a critical error regarding the height.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question without including any unnecessary information. It sticks to the point, providing the height and the names of the cascades without any additional details that are not requested in the question. Therefore, the answer is highly relevant to the question asked.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer contains a significant error (the height of the Jog Falls) but correctly identifies the names of the four cascades and is directly relevant to the question. The error in height is crucial, as it directly pertains to one of the two main inquiries of the question.\n\nConsidering the scale provided:\n- A score of 2 is not applicable because the answer contains an error regarding the height.\n- A score of 1 is also not fully applicable because, while the answer is relevant, the error in height is significant and not just a matter of irrelevant information.\n- A score of 0 is not applicable because the answer does provide information relevant to the question.\n- A score of -1 is the most fitting because the answer contains a critical error (incorrect height), which makes it incorrect despite its relevance and partial coverage of the question's requirements.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: -1",
