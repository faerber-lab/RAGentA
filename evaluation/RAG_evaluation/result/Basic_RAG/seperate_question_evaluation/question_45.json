  "question": "Do both osteoarthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica cause joint stiffness?",
  "generated_answer": "Yes, both osteoarthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica can cause joint stiffness. In osteoarthritis, stiffness is typically less than an hour in the morning, while in polymyalgia rheumatica, stiffness is more severe and lasts longer than 30 minutes, often worsening in the morning or after periods of inactivity.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, both conditions cause joint stiffness, but in different ways. In osteoarthritis, joint stiffness is one of the irreversible symptoms that appears after the disease has progressed. In polymyalgia rheumatica, stiffness is a primary symptom, particularly affecting the neck, shoulders, and hips, and is most severe in the morning or after periods of inactivity, typically lasting longer than 30 minutes.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Both osteoarthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica can cause joint stiffness.**\n   - This claim is supported by the passages. Passage 6 discusses osteoarthritis and mentions stiffness as a symptom, while several passages (e.g., Passage 1, Passage 3, Passage 7) mention stiffness as a symptom of polymyalgia rheumatica.\n\n2. **In osteoarthritis, stiffness is typically less than an hour in the morning.**\n   - This specific detail about the duration of morning stiffness in osteoarthritis is not directly mentioned in the provided passages. However, Passage 6 mentions that osteoarthritis symptoms can include stiffness, especially in the mornings, but it does not specify the duration.\n\n3. **In polymyalgia rheumatica, stiffness is more severe and lasts longer than 30 minutes, often worsening in the morning or after periods of inactivity.**\n   - This claim is supported by the passages. For example, Passage 1 states that the discomfort (including stiffness) in polymyalgia rheumatica generally lasts longer than 30 minutes and is most severe in the morning or after a period of inactivity. Similar information is found in Passage 7.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer has partial support from the passages. The first and third claims are directly supported, but the second claim about the specific duration of morning stiffness in osteoarthritis is not explicitly mentioned in the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.5",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the comparison with the ground truth answer based on the aspects of coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers the essential information that both osteoarthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica cause joint stiffness. It also attempts to differentiate between the two conditions by describing the nature and duration of stiffness. However, it slightly misrepresents the information about osteoarthritis, stating that stiffness is \"typically less than an hour in the morning,\" which is not explicitly mentioned in the ground truth. The ground truth emphasizes that in osteoarthritis, joint stiffness is one of the irreversible symptoms appearing after the disease has progressed, without specifying a typical duration. For polymyalgia rheumatica, the generated answer correctly notes that stiffness is more severe, lasts longer than 30 minutes, and worsens in the morning or after inactivity, aligning with the ground truth.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question without including unnecessary information. It stays focused on the comparison between osteoarthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica regarding joint stiffness, providing relevant details about the nature and duration of stiffness in both conditions.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is largely correct and relevant but contains a minor inaccuracy regarding the description of osteoarthritis stiffness duration. Since the question asks for an evaluation on a continuous scale from -1 to 2, and given that the answer is mostly accurate, directly relevant, but with a slight deviation from the ground truth, the score should reflect its overall correctness while accounting for the minor discrepancy.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.5",
