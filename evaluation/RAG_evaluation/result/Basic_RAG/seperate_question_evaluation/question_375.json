  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's analyze the claim made: \"The capital of the Ashanti Kingdom was Kumasi.\"\n\nThis claim is directly supported by multiple passages:\n\n1. **PASSAGE 2** explicitly states, \"The Region is the seat of the kingdom of Ashanti and its capital is Kumasi which is the second largest city in Ghana.\"\n2. **PASSAGE 4** mentions, \"They designated Kumasi the Ashanti capital.\"\n3. **PASSAGE 7** notes, \"One particular clan, the Oyoko, had settled in the Ashanti\u2019s sub-tropical forest region, establishing a centre at Kumasi.\"\n4. **PASSAGE 10** also refers to Kumasi as \"the Asante capital.\"\n\nGiven that the claim is consistently supported across these passages without any contradiction, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported by the provided passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": 2.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the process into steps considering the aspects of coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Understanding the Ground Truth**: The ground truth answer provides detailed information about the capital of the Ashanti Kingdom, specifying that Kumasi was designated as the capital by Okomfo Anokye and Osei Tutu when they established the state. This gives us a full context of not just the location but also the historical figures involved in its designation.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Generated Answer**: The generated answer states, \"The capital of the Ashanti Kingdom was Kumasi.\" This answer directly addresses the question by providing the name of the capital.\n\n3. **Evaluating Coverage**: The generated answer covers the essential part of the ground truth, which is the identification of Kumasi as the capital of the Ashanti Kingdom. However, it lacks the additional historical context provided in the ground truth about Okomfo Anokye and Osei Tutu. Despite this, the core information requested by the question (the location of the capital) is fully present.\n\n4. **Evaluating Relevance**: The generated answer is directly relevant to the question asked. It does not contain any unnecessary information, making it a concise and accurate response to the query about the capital's location.\n\n5. **Determining Correctness**: Given that the generated answer accurately identifies Kumasi as the capital of the Ashanti Kingdom and does so without including any irrelevant information, it aligns well with the criteria for a correct answer. The only consideration is that it does not provide the full historical context available in the ground truth, but this does not detract from its correctness regarding the question's specific ask.\n\n6. **Scoring**: Considering the generated answer provides all the vital information requested by the question (the capital's name) and does so in a relevant manner without unnecessary details, it deserves a high score. However, because it lacks the additional historical context that could enrich the answer, it might not be considered perfect. Given the options, a score of 2 seems most appropriate because the answer is both correct and completely relevant, directly addressing the question without omission of necessary information or inclusion of unnecessary information.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
