  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's analyze the claim made: \"Diplomatic relations between Nepal and Switzerland were established in November 1959.\"\n\nThis claim is directly supported by Passage 1, which states: \"Diplomatic relations between Nepal and Switzerland were established in November 1959.\"\n\nHowever, Passage 3 provides a slightly different date, stating: \"Diplomatic relations between Switzerland and Nepal have existed since 1956...\" This discrepancy suggests that while the answer is supported by one passage, it contradicts information found in another.\n\nGiven this analysis, the claim in the answer is partially supported by the passages. The direct support from Passage 1 confirms the November 1959 date, but the mention of 1956 in Passage 3 introduces a contradiction regarding the exact start year of diplomatic relations.\n\nConsidering the scale provided:\n- The answer is not fully supported (score of 1) because of the contradiction.\n- It is not entirely unsupported (score of -1) since one passage directly confirms the claim.\n- Thus, the faithfulness score should reflect partial support.\n\nGiven the direct confirmation from one passage and the contradiction from another, the faithfulness of the answer leans towards partial support but is weakened by the inconsistency across the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.5",
