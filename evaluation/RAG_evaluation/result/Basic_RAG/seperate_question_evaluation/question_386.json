  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: There are two main types of muscles making up the shoulder girdle: global movers and local stabilizers.\n   - **Support**: This claim is directly supported by Passage 1 and Passage 10. Passage 1 mentions that \"There are two main types of muscles making up the shoulder girdle, these are the global movers and the local stabilizers.\" Passage 10 also lists the global movers and local stabilizers of the shoulder joint, further supporting this claim.\n\n2. **Claim**: The global movers are responsible for moving the arm and scapula, while the local stabilizers stabilize and centralize the humerus within the glenoidal surface.\n   - **Support**: This claim is partially supported. Passage 1 explains the role of global movers and local stabilizers but specifically mentions that local stabilizers \"stabilize and thus centralize the humerus inside the glenoidal surface,\" which aligns with the claim. However, the detailed functions of global movers as described in Passage 10 provide more specific actions (e.g., anteflexion, abduction, horizontal abduction) but do not directly mention the responsibility for moving both the arm and scapula in a general sense as stated in the claim.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer's claims are largely supported by the passages, especially the distinction between global movers and local stabilizers and their general functions. However, the description of global movers' responsibilities is more detailed in Passage 10 than what is claimed. Since the main claim about the two types of muscles and their general roles is well-supported, and considering the partial support for the specific responsibilities, the faithfulness score would lean towards full support but acknowledges the slight discrepancy in the detailed description of global movers' functions.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.8",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the two key aspects: coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer mentions the two main types of muscles in the shoulder girdle as \"global movers\" and \"local stabilizers.\" This directly aligns with the ground truth answer, indicating that the vital information regarding the types of muscles is fully covered. Additionally, the generated answer explains the functions of both types of muscles, which matches the ground truth. The global movers are correctly identified as responsible for moving the arm and scapula, and the local stabilizers are correctly described as stabilizing and centralizing the humerus within the glenoidal surface. Therefore, the coverage of vital information is complete.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question without including any unnecessary information. It sticks to the point, defining the two main types of muscles in the shoulder girdle and their functions, exactly as the question requires. There is no extraneous information that could be considered irrelevant to the question asked.\n\nGiven that the generated answer fully covers the vital information from the ground truth and is directly relevant to the question without any unnecessary details, it meets the criteria for being both correct and completely relevant.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
