  "question": "shoulder joint structure function causes pain",
  "generated_answer": "The shoulder joint is a complex structure composed of three bones: the humerus (upper arm bone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the clavicle (collarbone). It consists of two main joints: the glenohumeral joint, where the head of the humerus fits into the glenoid cavity of the scapula, and the acromioclavicular (AC) joint, where the clavicle articulates with the acromion of the scapula.\n\nThe shoulder joint has a wide range of motion, which makes it highly mobile but also inherently unstable. This mobility is facilitated by the rotator cuff, a group of four muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis) and their tendons that surround the shoulder joint, providing stability and enabling a wide range of motion.\n\nShoulder pain can be caused by a variety of factors, including:\n\n1. **Rotator Cuff Injuries**: These can include tendinitis (inflammation of the tendons), bursitis (inflammation of the bursa sacs), and tears in the rotator cuff tendons. These injuries often result from overuse, trauma, or degeneration over time.\n\n2. **Instability**: This occurs when the shoulder joint is loose and can dislocate or sublux (partially dislocate). This can be due to trauma, repetitive stress, or congenital factors.\n\n3. **Arthritis**: Both osteoarthritis (wear and tear) and inflammatory arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis) can affect the shoulder joint, causing pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion.\n\n4. **Fractures**: Breaks in the bones of the shoulder, such as the clavicle, scapula, or humerus, can result from trauma, falls, or sports injuries.\n\n5. **Impingement Syndrome**: This occurs when the rotator cuff tendons and bursa are compressed between the humeral head and the acromion, leading to inflammation and pain.\n\n6. **Adhesive Capsulitis (Frozen Shoulder)**: This condition involves the stiffening of the shoulder joint capsule, leading to pain and restricted movement.\n\n7. **Muscle Strains and Sprains**: Overuse or sudden injury can lead to strains or sprains in the muscles and ligaments surrounding the shoulder joint.\n\n8. **Nerve Compression**: Conditions like thoracic outlet syndrome or cervical radiculopathy can cause shoulder pain due to compression of nerves in the neck or shoulder region.\n\n9. **Postural Issues**: Poor posture can lead to imbalances in the muscles around the shoulder, causing pain and discomfort.\n\n10. **Shoulder Instability**: This can be caused by a previous dislocation or subluxation, leading to chronic pain and instability.\n\n11. **Bursitis**: Inflammation of the bursae, small fluid-filled sacs that reduce friction between moving parts, can cause pain and stiffness.\n\n12. **Trauma**: Direct blows, falls, or other traumatic events can cause injuries to the shoulder joint and surrounding structures.\n\n13. **Osteoarthritis**: This is a degenerative joint disease that affects the cartilage in the shoulder joint, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion.\n\n14. **Rotator Cuff Tears**: These can be acute (resulting from a sudden injury) or chronic (developing over time due to wear and tear).\n\n15. **Shoulder Impingement**: This occurs when the rotator cuff tendons and bursa are compressed between the humeral head and the acromion, leading to inflammation and pain.\n\n16. **Muscle Imbalances**: Weakness or tightness in the muscles around the shoulder can lead to pain and dysfunction.\n\n17. **Referred Pain**: Sometimes, pain in the shoulder can be referred from other areas, such as the neck or spine.\n\n18. **Shoulder Instability**: This can be caused by a previous dislocation or subluxation, leading to chronic pain and instability.\n\n19. **Bursitis**: Inflammation of the bursae, small fluid-filled sacs that reduce friction between moving parts, can cause pain and stiffness.\n\n20. **Trauma**: Direct blows, falls, or other traumatic events can cause injuries to the shoulder joint and surrounding structures.\n\n21. **Osteoarthritis**: This is a degenerative joint disease that affects the cartilage in the shoulder joint, leading to pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion.\n\n22. **Rotator Cuff Tears**: These can be acute (resulting from a sudden injury) or chronic (developing over time due to wear and tear).\n\n23. **Shoulder Impingement**: This occurs when the rotator cuff tendons and bursa are compressed between the humeral head and the acrom",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The shoulder is a ball and socket joint formed by the glenoid cavity of scapula and head of humerus, allowing significant range of motion. The joint is stabilized by muscles including the infraspinatous, supraspinatous (lateral support), and subscapularis (medial support). Pain in the shoulder joint commonly occurs due to tendonitis, particularly rotator cuff tendonitis, which involves inflammation of the tendons attaching rotator cuff muscles to bone. This condition can be caused by overuse, repetitive overhead motions, injury, poor posture, or improper technique.",
