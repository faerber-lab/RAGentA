His father, Andr\u00e9s Cantor, was a legendary Argentine sportscaster who called all 52 FIFA World Cup USA 1994 matches in Spanish for Univision Network in the United States. Nico's early achievements in broadcasting include working with his father's radio company, F\u00fatbol de Primera (Radio), and being part of ESPN's tertiary broadcast team for the telecasts of the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup.\n\nMarie-Jos\u00e9e Ta Lou's athletic career started in 2007 when she got into athletics after discovering that one of her classmates' mother was an athletics coach.
