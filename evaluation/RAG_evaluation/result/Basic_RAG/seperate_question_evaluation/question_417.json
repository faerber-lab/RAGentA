  "question": "How do the safety features of the UH-1H tailboom motion detection system compare to the UH-60 Blackhawk's structural safety features?",
  "generated_answer": "The documents provided do not contain specific information on the safety features of the UH-1H tailboom motion detection system or a direct comparison to the structural safety features of the UH-60 Blackhawk. Therefore, a detailed comparison cannot be made based on the given information.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The UH-1H's BART Switch tailboom motion detection system alerts pilots to potential tailboom failure through a master caution panel indicator, allowing for preventive action. The UH-60 Blackhawk has different safety features including ballistically hardened flight controls, redundant electric and hydraulic systems, crash-resistant self-sealing fuel system, and energy-absorbing crew seats and landing gear.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The documents provided do not contain specific information on the safety features of the UH-1H tailboom motion detection system.\n   - **Support**: Passages 1 and 2 discuss the Tailboom Motion Detection System, also known as the BART Switch, which is designed to alert the pilot of a cracked upper LH tailboom fitting, longeron, or attach bolt in UH-1 helicopters. While these passages provide information on the system's purpose and installation, they do not directly compare its safety features to those of the UH-60 Blackhawk. Thus, the claim that the documents lack specific information on the safety features of the UH-1H tailboom motion detection system, in the context of comparing it to the UH-60 Blackhawk, is supported.\n\n2. **Claim**: A direct comparison to the structural safety features of the UH-60 Blackhawk cannot be made based on the given information.\n   - **Support**: Passages 6 and 10 provide information on the UH-60 Blackhawk's structural safety features, such as its tolerance to small arms fire, crashworthy self-sealing fuel tanks, and ballistic hardening of flight controls. However, none of the passages directly compare these features to the safety features of the UH-1H tailboom motion detection system. Therefore, this claim is also supported by the passages.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer's claims are supported by the passages. The passages do provide some information on the safety features of both the UH-1H tailboom motion detection system and the UH-60 Blackhawk but do not offer a direct comparison between the two. Thus, the answer accurately reflects the content of the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": 0.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not provide any specific information about the safety features of the UH-1H tailboom motion detection system or the structural safety features of the UH-60 Blackhawk. It states that the documents provided do not contain specific information on these topics, which directly implies that the answer lacks coverage of the vital information present in the ground truth. The ground truth provides detailed information about the safety features of both the UH-1H and the UH-60 Blackhawk, which is entirely absent in the generated answer. Therefore, in terms of coverage, the generated answer scores poorly.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by stating that a comparison cannot be made due to a lack of information in the provided documents. This response is relevant to the question asked because it acknowledges the inquiry and provides a reason for not being able to fulfill it. However, the relevance is somewhat diminished by the fact that it does not attempt to provide any information that might be available or infer any comparisons that could be made based on general knowledge or other sources. The answer stays strictly within the bounds of the information given (or the lack thereof) and does not introduce unnecessary information, making it relevant but not fully informative.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not provide any of the vital information from the ground truth, making it lacking in coverage. However, it is relevant in that it directly addresses the question without providing unnecessary information. The closest score that reflects this analysis would be 0, as the answer essentially states that no answer can be provided due to insufficient information, which aligns with the description for a score of 0.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0.0",
