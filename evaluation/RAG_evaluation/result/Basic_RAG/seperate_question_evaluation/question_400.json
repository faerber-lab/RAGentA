  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\nThe answer states: \"No, both kimonos and hanboks are not commonly worn as everyday clothing in Japan and Korea. They are typically reserved for special occasions and formal events.\"\n\n1. **Kimonos not commonly worn as everyday clothing in Japan**: This claim is supported by several passages. For example, PASSAGE 1 mentions that Japanese kimonos are \"usually reserved for special occasions,\" and PASSAGE 5 notes that \"traditional Japanese garments are mainly worn for ceremonies and special events due to the Westernisation and complexity of traditional Japanese fashion.\" Similarly, PASSAGE 8 states that during the Meiji period, it was encouraged to wear Western-style clothing, and the kimono fell out of favor as a daily garment.\n\n2. **Hanboks not commonly worn as everyday clothing in Korea**: This claim is also supported by the passages. PASSAGE 2 states that the Hanbok is \"regarded as too outdated and impractical for daily wear\" and is mostly worn on special occasions. PASSAGE 3 mentions that \"it\u2019s rare to see people wearing Hanbok on the street,\" though it notes exceptions for certain ethnic minorities, royal guards, and tour guides. PASSAGE 6 similarly notes that hanbok isn't worn as an everyday garment anymore but is worn to formal occasions or special events.\n\nGiven the analysis, both claims made by the answer are directly supported by the passages. The passages consistently indicate that both kimonos and hanboks are traditional garments primarily reserved for special occasions and not commonly worn in everyday life in Japan and Korea, respectively.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer states that both kimonos and hanboks are not commonly worn as everyday clothing in Japan and Korea and are typically reserved for special occasions and formal events. This captures the essential information from the ground truth that neither kimonos nor hanboks are worn as everyday clothing anymore but are worn during special occasions. However, it does not specify the types of special occasions (like weddings, funerals, tea ceremonies for kimonos, and weddings, New Year's Day for hanbok) as mentioned in the ground truth. Despite this, the core message about their usage is preserved.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question without providing any unnecessary information. It stays focused on the topic of whether kimonos and hanboks are commonly worn as everyday clothing and correctly identifies that they are not, reserving their use for special occasions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in stating that kimonos and hanboks are not commonly worn as everyday clothing and are used for special occasions. However, it lacks the specificity of occasions provided in the ground truth. Since it directly addresses the question without unnecessary information but doesn't cover all the details from the ground truth, it falls short of being completely relevant in terms of detail but is still correct in its core message.\n\nTherefore, considering the continuous scale provided, the generated answer would score high because it is correct and directly relevant to the question, even though it lacks some detail from the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
