  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The X-45C portion of the program received $767 million from DARPA in October 2004, to construct and test three aircraft, along with several supplemental goals.\n   - **Support**: This claim is directly supported by Passage 1.\n\n2. **Claim**: The X-45C included an F404 engine.\n   - **Support**: This claim is also directly supported by Passage 1.\n\n3. **Claim**: In July 2005, DARPA awarded an additional $175 million to continue the program, as well as implement autonomous Aerial refueling technology.\n   - **Support**: This claim is directly supported by Passage 1.\n\nGiven that all claims made in the answer are directly supported by the passages, specifically Passage 1, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": 1.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers the vital information from the ground truth. It mentions the X-45C program receiving $767 million from DARPA in October 2004 for constructing and testing three aircraft. Additionally, it includes the information about DARPA awarding an additional $175 million in July 2005 to continue the program and implement autonomous aerial refueling technology. Thus, the generated answer fully covers the financial and developmental aspects mentioned in the ground truth.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about the Boeing X-45C DARPA funding amount and the development of autonomous aerial refueling technology. However, it also includes the detail about the X-45C including an F404 engine, which, while true, is not directly relevant to the question about funding amounts and autonomous aerial refueling development. This additional information does not detract from the correctness of the answer regarding the funding and the autonomous aerial refueling technology but does introduce a piece of information not directly requested.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in terms of the vital information it provides about the funding and the development of autonomous aerial refueling technology. However, it contains a minor piece of irrelevant information (the mention of the F404 engine), which does not impact the correctness of the answer regarding the question's focus but adds unnecessary detail.\n\nTherefore, the generated answer is correct but contains some irrelevant information, which aligns with a score of 1 on the provided scale.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
