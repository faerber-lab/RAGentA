  "question": "I need help with mobile app testing - between Kobiton and Serverless Chrome, which one specializes in mobile testing capabilities?",
  "generated_answer": "Kobiton specializes in mobile testing capabilities. Serverless Chrome, as the name suggests, focuses on providing serverless execution environments for Chrome, which can be used for web testing but is not specifically designed for mobile testing.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Kobiton is specifically designed for mobile testing, while Serverless Chrome is not focused on mobile applications. Kobiton is a mobile testing platform that provides comprehensive mobile visual validation and Visual UX testing solutions, built specifically for optimizing mobile UI by searching for visual bugs. It offers features like scriptless automation, visual and text affirmations, and local device connections. Serverless Chrome, in contrast, is primarily focused on running headless Chrome on AWS Lambda for web-based tasks like taking screenshots and printing to PDF. For mobile testing needs, Kobiton would be the more appropriate choice with pricing starting at $500 per year for teams wanting immediate access to real-world devices.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claims made in the answer and check if they are supported by the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: Kobiton specializes in mobile testing capabilities.\n   - **Support**: Passages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 all mention Kobiton in the context of mobile testing, indicating that Kobiton indeed specializes in mobile testing capabilities. This claim is fully supported.\n\n2. **Claim**: Serverless Chrome focuses on providing serverless execution environments for Chrome, which can be used for web testing but is not specifically designed for mobile testing.\n   - **Support**: The passages provided do not directly mention \"Serverless Chrome\" in the context described. However, Passage 7 discusses serverless application development, and while it does not specifically mention Serverless Chrome, it implies a focus on web development. Passage 8 mentions BrowserStack, which is a cloud web and mobile testing platform, but it does not directly support the claim about Serverless Chrome. Since there's no direct information about Serverless Chrome in the passages, this claim has partial support at best, primarily because the passages do not contradict it but also do not provide clear evidence for it.\n\nGiven the analysis, the first claim is fully supported, and the second claim has partial support due to the lack of direct information about Serverless Chrome in the passages. However, since the question asks for a faithfulness score on a continuous scale from -1 to 1, we need to consider the overall support provided by the passages for the answer.\n\nThe answer's core claim about Kobiton is well-supported, which is a significant part of the question. The mention of Serverless Chrome, while not directly supported, does not contradict the passages and aligns with the general understanding of serverless technologies being more commonly associated with web testing rather than mobile testing. Therefore, the answer does not introduce claims that are directly contradicted by the passages, but it also does not receive full support for every detail, particularly regarding Serverless Chrome.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the faithfulness score should reflect that the answer is largely supported, especially concerning Kobiton, but lacks direct evidence for the specifics about Serverless Chrome.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.8",
  "correctness_score": 2.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer correctly identifies Kobiton as specializing in mobile testing capabilities and distinguishes it from Serverless Chrome, which is not designed for mobile testing. This aligns with the vital information provided in the ground truth answer. However, the generated answer lacks specific details about Kobiton's features (such as scriptless automation, visual and text affirmations, and local device connections) and its pricing, which are mentioned in the ground truth. Despite this, it covers the core distinction between Kobiton and Serverless Chrome regarding their focus on mobile testing.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question without introducing unnecessary information. It stays focused on the comparison between Kobiton and Serverless Chrome in the context of mobile testing capabilities, which is exactly what the question asks for. There's no irrelevant information provided that could distract from the main query.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is correct in identifying Kobiton as the platform that specializes in mobile testing capabilities and in distinguishing it from Serverless Chrome. However, it does not provide the full scope of details available in the ground truth answer, such as specific features and pricing. Since the question asks for a comparison based on mobile testing capabilities and the generated answer correctly and relevantly addresses this without providing unnecessary information, it falls into the category of being correct but potentially lacking in comprehensive detail.\n\nGiven the continuous scale provided, the score should reflect that the answer is correct and directly relevant to the question asked but might not cover all the nuances or additional details present in the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
