  "question": "As someone who studies sensory experiences in entertainment, how do the special effects in Spectra at Marina Bay Sands compare to those in INFINITY attraction?",
  "generated_answer": "I'm sorry, but I don't have enough information to answer the question about how the special effects in Spectra at Marina Bay Sands compare to those in the INFINITY attraction. The documents provided do not contain specific details about the special effects used in either Spectra or INFINITY, so a direct comparison cannot be made based on the given information.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Spectra focuses on visual presentations combining laser effects, sparkling fountain jets, and digital arts, telling Singapore's history through four parts. In contrast, INFINITY offers a broader multisensory experience including interactive displays, bizarre soundfields, mind-bending illusions, uneven and moving floors, and various lighting effects including strobe lights and fog effects, making it a more comprehensive sensory experience.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "The answer states that it doesn't have enough information to compare the special effects in Spectra at Marina Bay Sands to those in the INFINITY attraction. To evaluate the faithfulness of this answer, we need to check if the passages provide any information about the special effects in Spectra at Marina Bay Sands and INFINITY.\n\nUpon analyzing the passages, we find that:\n\n* There is no mention of \"Spectra\" in any of the passages.\n* There is no mention of \"INFINITY attraction\" in any of the passages, although \"Infinity\" is mentioned in the context of the infinity pool at Marina Bay Sands.\n* Some passages mention the special effects and attractions at Marina Bay Sands, such as the Sands SkyPark, the ArtScience Museum, and the casino, but none of them mention \"Spectra\" or \"INFINITY attraction\".\n* Passage 2 mentions special effects such as strobe lights, loud sounds, and haptic effects, but it is not clear if these are related to Spectra or INFINITY.\n\nGiven the lack of information about Spectra and INFINITY attraction in the passages, the answer's claim that it doesn't have enough information to compare the special effects is supported.\n\nHowever, the answer could have been more accurate if it had stated that there is no information about Spectra or INFINITY attraction in the passages, rather than simply saying it doesn't have enough information.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.5",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not provide any specific details about the special effects used in either Spectra at Marina Bay Sands or the INFINITY attraction. It states a lack of information, which means it fails to cover any of the vital information present in the ground truth answer. The ground truth provides a detailed comparison of the special effects in both attractions, highlighting the unique aspects of each. In contrast, the generated answer does not offer any comparative analysis or description of the special effects. Therefore, in terms of coverage, the generated answer scores poorly because it does not address the core of the question.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is relevant in the sense that it directly addresses the question by stating its inability to provide a comparison due to a lack of information. However, this relevance is limited because the answer does not attempt to provide any information that could be useful for the comparison, even if it's just a general statement about the nature of the attractions or their focus areas. The answer is concise and directly states its limitation, which aligns with the question asked but does not contribute to the understanding of the special effects in either attraction.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not provide any useful information regarding the comparison of special effects between Spectra at Marina Bay Sands and the INFINITY attraction. It simply states that it cannot answer the question due to a lack of information, which aligns with the definition of a score of 0, indicating that no answer was provided in terms of content relevant to the question.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0",
