  "question": "I'm preparing for a high-level AMEB piano exam - do I need to complete any theory exams to get my certificate?",
  "generated_answer": "For AMEB piano exams, you do not need to complete theory exams to get your certificate up until Grade 5. Starting from Grade 6, you need to pass a music theory test in order to pass your practical test. Here's a table of what theory test you need to pass at each grade level (starting at grade 6):\n\n- Grade 6: Theory of Music 1\n- Grade 7: Theory of Music 2\n- Grade 8: Theory of Music 3\n\nPlease note that these theory exams are specific to the AMEB system and may not correspond directly with theory exams from other exam boards like Trinity or ABRSM.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, starting from Grade 6, you must pass a music theory test to receive your practical test certificate. AMEB offers three types of theory exams: Theory of Music, Musicianship, and Music Craft. They also accept Trinity and ABRSM theory exam results for this requirement.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: For AMEB piano exams, you do not need to complete theory exams to get your certificate up until Grade 5.\n   - **Support**: This claim is directly supported by Passage 1, which states, \"Up until a grade 5 level, you\u2019re not required to do a theory exam to get your certificate when you do a practical exam.\"\n\n2. **Claim**: Starting from Grade 6, you need to pass a music theory test in order to pass your practical test.\n   - **Support**: This claim is also supported by Passage 1, which mentions, \"But starting from Grade 6, you need to pass a music theory test in order to pass your practical test.\"\n\n3. **Claim**: The table of what theory test you need to pass at each grade level (starting at grade 6) is provided.\n   - **Support**: Passage 1 does mention that there's a table explaining which theory test is required for each grade level starting from Grade 6, but the details of the table (e.g., Theory of Music 1 for Grade 6, Theory of Music 2 for Grade 7, Theory of Music 3 for Grade 8) are not explicitly provided in the passages. However, the structure of requiring theory exams from Grade 6 onwards is supported.\n\n4. **Claim**: These theory exams are specific to the AMEB system and may not correspond directly with theory exams from other exam boards like Trinity or ABRSM.\n   - **Support**: Passage 1 notes that Trinity and ABRSM exams also count for AMEB theory requirements, implying differences but also some level of recognition or correspondence between systems.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer's claims are largely supported by the passages, particularly Passage 1, which directly addresses the requirements for theory exams in relation to practical exams for AMEB piano students. The only part not fully supported is the specific table detailing theory requirements for each grade, but the principle that theory exams are required from Grade 6 onwards is well-supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.8",
  "correctness_score": 1.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the key points from the ground truth and compare them with the information provided in the generated answer.\n\n1. **Coverage of Vital Information**: The ground truth states that starting from Grade 6, a music theory test is required to receive the practical test certificate. It also mentions that AMEB offers three types of theory exams (Theory of Music, Musicianship, and Music Craft) and accepts Trinity and ABRSM theory exam results. The generated answer correctly states the requirement for music theory tests starting from Grade 6 but only specifies the need for \"Theory of Music\" exams without mentioning Musicianship, Music Craft, or the acceptance of Trinity and ABRSM results. This indicates a partial coverage of vital information.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about the necessity of theory exams for AMEB piano exams, providing specific grade levels and corresponding theory exams. However, it introduces a table that outlines the theory exams needed for each grade level, which, while relevant, might be considered slightly excessive or not fully aligned with the ground truth, as it does not account for the other types of theory exams or external exam results accepted by AMEB. Additionally, the statement about theory exams being specific to the AMEB system and not corresponding directly with other exam boards could be seen as slightly irrelevant or misleading, given that AMEB does accept results from other boards like Trinity and ABRSM.\n\n3. **Accuracy and Completeness**: The generated answer is mostly accurate in stating the requirement for theory exams from Grade 6 onwards but lacks completeness by not fully detailing the types of theory exams offered by AMEB or the acceptance of external theory exam results. It also incorrectly implies a strict progression through \"Theory of Music\" exams without acknowledging other pathways.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is correct in its core message about the necessity of theory exams from Grade 6 but contains inaccuracies and lacks completeness regarding the specifics of the theory exams and the recognition of external exam results. It also introduces some information that, while related, does not fully align with the question's requirements or the ground truth.\n\nGiven the analysis, the generated answer would score higher than -1 (incorrect answer) but does not achieve a perfect score of 2 due to the incomplete and partially inaccurate information provided.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
