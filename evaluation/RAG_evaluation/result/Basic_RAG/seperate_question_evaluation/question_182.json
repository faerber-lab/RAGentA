  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer \"BDA Engineers\" in relation to the query \"structural engineer social condenser project arizona,\" we need to analyze the passages provided to see if they support the claim that BDA Engineers is indeed the structural engineer for the Social Condenser project in Arizona.\n\n1. **Claim Analysis**: The answer provides a name, \"BDA Engineers,\" which is claimed to be associated with the Social Condenser project in Arizona as the structural engineer.\n\n2. **Passage Support**:\n   - **PASSAGE 1** directly mentions \"Structural Engineer: BDA Engineers\" in the context of the Social Condenser project located in Superior, Arizona. This passage fully supports the claim made by the answer.\n   - The other passages (2 through 10) do not mention the Social Condenser project or BDA Engineers in a context relevant to the query.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since PASSAGE 1 directly supports the claim that BDA Engineers is the structural engineer for the Social Condenser project in Arizona, and there is no contradictory information in the other passages, the answer is fully supported by the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the process step by step, considering the aspects of coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks for the structural engineer involved in the \"Social Condenser project\" in Arizona. This implies we are looking for the name of the engineering firm or individual responsible for the structural aspects of the project.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Ground Truth Answer**: The ground truth answer provided is \"BDA Engineers was the structural engineer for the Social Condenser project in Superior, Arizona.\" This gives us the full context: the project's name, its location (Superior, Arizona), and the structural engineer (BDA Engineers).\n\n3. **Evaluating the Generated Answer**: The generated answer is simply \"BDA Engineers.\" \n\n4. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers a crucial piece of information from the ground truth, which is the name of the structural engineer (\"BDA Engineers\"). However, it lacks other vital details present in the ground truth, such as the project's name (\"Social Condenser project\") and its specific location (\"Superior, Arizona\"). Thus, the coverage is partial.\n\n5. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing the name of the structural engineer without including any unnecessary information. It is concise and to the point, directly answering who the structural engineer was, even though it doesn't provide the full context.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Given that the generated answer provides the essential information requested (the name of the structural engineer) but lacks the full context (project name and location), and considering it does so without including any irrelevant information, the answer can be considered correct but not completely relevant due to the missing details.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
