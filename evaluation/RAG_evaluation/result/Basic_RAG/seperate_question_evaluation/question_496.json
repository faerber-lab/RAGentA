  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer includes the core definition of an age-friendly community as provided by the ground truth. It mentions that an age-friendly community, according to the WHO, supports and enables older adults and people with varying needs and capacities to remain healthy, active, and engaged. This shows that the vital information from the ground truth is present in the generated answer. Additionally, the generated answer expands on this by mentioning the WHO's eight key domains that contribute to creating age-friendly environments. This expansion indicates a comprehensive coverage of the concept, going beyond the basic definition to provide more detailed information about what constitutes an age-friendly community.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The question asks for the definition of an age-friendly community according to the WHO. The generated answer directly addresses this question by first providing the definition and then elaborating on the key domains identified by the WHO. While the additional information about the eight domains could be considered as providing more context than strictly necessary to answer the question, it is directly relevant to understanding the concept of age-friendly communities as defined by the WHO. The information about the commitment to creating physical and social environments, the promotion of healthy aging, and the quality of life for older citizens, as well as the detailed listing of the eight domains, all pertain to the characteristics and goals of age-friendly communities. Therefore, the generated answer is relevant, although it contains more information than the minimal required to answer the question.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct and provides comprehensive information relevant to the question. However, it includes additional details that, while relevant, go beyond the minimal definition provided in the ground truth. This means the answer is not just a direct, minimal response but an elaborated one that enhances understanding of the concept.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
