  "question": "What is the difference in Energy Usage Intensity (EUI) between a recently built commercial office building and a typical pharmaceutical plant?",
  "generated_answer": "The Energy Usage Intensity (EUI) for a recently built commercial office building is 81.4 kBtu/sq.ft. (257 kWh/m3), while the EUI for a typical pharmaceutical plant is 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,819 kWh/m2). The difference in EUI between these two types of buildings is 1,128.6 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,562 kWh/m2).",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The average recently built (after 2000) commercial office building has an EUI of 81.4kBtu/sq.ft. (257 kWh/m3), while the average pharmaceutical plant has an EUI of 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,819 kWh/m2), which is more than an order of magnitude larger.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claims made in the answer and check if they are supported by the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The Energy Usage Intensity (EUI) for a recently built commercial office building is 81.4 kBtu/sq.ft. (257 kWh/m3).\n   - **Support**: This claim is directly supported by Passage 1, which states, \"The average recently built (after 2000) commercial office building has an average EUI of 81.4kBtu/sq.ft. (257 kWh/m3).\"\n\n2. **Claim**: The EUI for a typical pharmaceutical plant is 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,819 kWh/m2).\n   - **Support**: This claim is also directly supported by Passage 1, which mentions, \"The average pharmaceutical plant has an EUI of 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,819 kWh/m2).\"\n\n3. **Claim**: The difference in EUI between these two types of buildings is 1,128.6 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,562 kWh/m2).\n   - **Support**: To calculate the difference, we subtract the EUI of the office building from that of the pharmaceutical plant: 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. - 81.4 kBtu/sq.ft. = 1,128.6 kBtu/sq.ft. This calculation is based on the values provided in Passage 1. However, the conversion to kWh/m2 (3,562 kWh/m2) is not directly supported by the passages as the exact conversion factor or the calculation for this specific difference in kWh/m2 is not provided. The units and conversion seem to be mixed up in the claim (using m2 for the pharmaceutical plant's EUI but m3 for the office building's EUI), which might indicate a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the original data.\n\nGiven the analysis, the first two claims are fully supported by Passage 1. However, the third claim about the difference, while partially calculable from the provided data, introduces a unit conversion (kWh/m2) that is not directly addressed in the passages for the specific context of comparing these two buildings' EUI differences. This introduces a slight discrepancy in the evaluation.\n\nConsidering the direct support for the first two claims and the partial support (due to the unit conversion issue) for the third claim, the overall faithfulness of the answer leans towards being mostly supported but with a minor discrepancy.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.8",
  "correctness_score": 2.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer provides the EUI values for both a recently built commercial office building and a typical pharmaceutical plant, which are 81.4 kBtu/sq.ft. (257 kWh/m3) and 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,819 kWh/m2), respectively. These values match the ground truth answer, indicating that the generated answer covers the vital information regarding the EUI of both types of buildings. Additionally, the generated answer calculates the difference in EUI between the two types of buildings, which is 1,128.6 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,562 kWh/m2). This calculation directly addresses the question about the difference in EUI, further ensuring good coverage of the vital information.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing the EUI values for both types of buildings and calculating their difference. It does not include any unnecessary or irrelevant information that would distract from the question asked. The focus is solely on providing the specific data related to the EUI of commercial office buildings and pharmaceutical plants, and the difference between them, which is exactly what the question seeks.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is both correct and directly relevant to the question asked. It provides all the necessary information without including any unnecessary details, making it a precise and accurate response.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
