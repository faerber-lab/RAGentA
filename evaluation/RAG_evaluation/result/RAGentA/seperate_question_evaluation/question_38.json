  "question": "I work in international construction. What leadership styles were used to manage the Hyundai hotel projects versus the King Abdullah University project?",
  "generated_answer": "The documents provided do not contain specific information about the leadership styles used to manage the Hyundai hotel projects or the King Abdullah University project. Therefore, it is not possible to answer this question based on the given documents. [No documents]",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The Hyundai hotel projects were managed through a hierarchical structure where Bill Swank reported directly up the chain of command, including to Chairman Chung Ju-yung, who would personally seek frank opinions and discuss progress. The KAUST project, on the other hand, used a more collaborative approach where HOK's leadership brought in experts to act as users or consultants during the design phase, and developed collective design principles and goals early in the process. Both approaches proved successful for their respective projects, with Hyundai relying on strong executive support and KAUST focusing on getting everyone 'going in the same direction.'",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "The answer states that the documents provided do not contain specific information about the leadership styles used to manage the Hyundai hotel projects or the King Abdullah University project. This claim is supported by the passages, as none of them mention the leadership styles used in these specific projects.\n\nPassages 1-10 discuss various topics related to construction, project management, and leadership, but none of them provide information about the leadership styles used in the Hyundai hotel projects or the King Abdullah University project.\n\nTherefore, the answer's claim that there is no information about the leadership styles used in these projects is supported by the passages.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that Passage 10 mentions the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) project, but it only discusses the project's design and awards, without mentioning the leadership style used.\n\nSince the answer's claim is supported by the passages, but the passages do not provide any direct information about the leadership styles used in the Hyundai hotel projects or the King Abdullah University project, the faithfulness score is 1, indicating full support.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer does not provide any information about the leadership styles used in the Hyundai hotel projects or the King Abdullah University project. In contrast, the ground truth answer provides detailed information about the hierarchical structure used in the Hyundai hotel projects and the collaborative approach used in the KAUST project. Therefore, the coverage of vital information from the ground truth in the generated answer is 0%, as it does not mention any specific leadership styles or approaches used in the projects.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by stating that it cannot provide an answer due to a lack of information in the documents. However, this response does not contain any unnecessary or irrelevant information regarding the question asked. It simply states the inability to answer based on the provided (or lack of) documents. Thus, while the answer is relevant in the context of responding to the question, it does not provide any relevant information about the leadership styles used in the projects.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not provide any correct information about the leadership styles used in the Hyundai hotel projects or the King Abdullah University project. It essentially states that it cannot answer the question, which aligns with a score of 0, as it does not provide an answer but also does not give incorrect information.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0",
