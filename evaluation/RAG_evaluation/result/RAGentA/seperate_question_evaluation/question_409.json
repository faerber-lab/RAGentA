  "question": "How do professional identity requirements compare between career counselors and biomedical engineers?",
  "generated_answer": "Professional identity requirements for career counselors and biomedical engineers differ significantly due to the distinct nature of their respective fields. Career counselors typically need a graduate degree in counseling, with some states requiring teaching experience. They must adhere to ethical guidelines set by the American Counseling Association and may need to be licensed or certified, which involves passing exams and completing continuing education. The median annual salary for career counselors was $53,610 in 2012, with prospects for growth due to increasing school enrollments In contrast, biomedical engineers require a bachelor\u2019s degree in bioengineering, biomedical engineering, electrical engineering, or mechanical engineering. They must have a strong foundation in engineering principles, physics, chemistry, and math, along with extensive coursework in biology, chemistry, biomaterials, and biomedical systems. Biomedical engineers often work in hospitals, medical equipment manufacturers, pharmaceutical companies, research and development organizations, and universities. The median annual salary for biomedical engineers was $88,040 in 2017, with a projected growth rate of 7% between 2016 and 2026, driven by the aging population and technological advancements",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Career counselors and biomedical engineers have different professional identity requirements. Career counselors need to be flexible in their professional identity, adapting to changing social contexts and potentially shifting from individual-focused to more communal approaches. In contrast, biomedical engineers require a fixed set of multidisciplinary skills, combining knowledge in exact sciences, life sciences, and medicine, with the ability to bridge between engineering and medical worlds.",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the comparison between career counselors and biomedical engineers based on the ground truth and the generated answer.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth highlights the need for flexibility in professional identity among career counselors, adapting to social contexts, and the requirement for a fixed set of multidisciplinary skills among biomedical engineers, combining exact sciences, life sciences, and medicine. The generated answer, however, focuses on the educational requirements, ethical guidelines, licensing, and salary prospects for career counselors, and the educational background, foundational knowledge, and work environments for biomedical engineers. While it provides detailed information about the professions, it does not directly address the concept of \"professional identity requirements\" as described in the ground truth. Thus, the coverage of vital information from the ground truth in the generated answer is limited.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer provides a lot of information about the educational requirements, job settings, and salary ranges for both career counselors and biomedical engineers. However, this information, although relevant to understanding the professions, does not directly address the comparison of their professional identity requirements as specified in the question. The answer includes details such as median annual salaries and growth prospects, which are not necessary for understanding the professional identity requirements. Therefore, the generated answer contains a significant amount of irrelevant information regarding the specific question asked.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does provide some correct information about the differences between career counselors and biomedical engineers but fails to directly address the question about professional identity requirements. It includes a lot of detail that, while correct, is not relevant to the question posed. Thus, the answer is correct in the sense that it discusses differences between the two professions but does so in a manner that is not directly relevant to the question about professional identity requirements.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
