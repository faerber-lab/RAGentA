  "question": "How do schools obtain emergency Albuterol supplies, and what are the medical documentation requirements for student medications at school?",
  "generated_answer": "Schools can obtain emergency Albuterol supplies through programs like RESCUE, which provides nebulizers and other asthma equipment to schools in specific service areas . For student medications, schools require medical documentation such as a signed Parent Consent/Administration Form and a completed Physician/Prescription Medication Form . These forms ensure the health and safety of all students and must be renewed each school year . Schools also need permission for students to carry emergency medications like inhalers or Epi-Pens, with a written statement from the student's physician and parent or guardian",
  "ground_truth_answer": "To obtain emergency Albuterol, schools in St. Louis City/County (MO) or St. Clair/Madison Counties (IL) can receive a free first round from Beverly Hills Pharmacy with a prescription from their Medical Director. Schools without a Medical Director can get assistance from Dr. Jim Wedner or Dr. David Campbell. For student medications at school, parents must provide a medication consent form (Form 1A) signed by both parent and physician for prescription medications, which must be in original pharmacy containers. Non-prescription medications require the original container and signed parent permission form. Students cannot carry medications without written agreement between the school district and parent, authorized by the student's physician.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Schools can obtain emergency Albuterol supplies through programs like RESCUE**: This claim is supported by Passage 4, which describes RESCUE as a program providing equipment for asthma emergencies, including nebulizers and other asthma equipment to schools in specific service areas. It also mentions that schools can stock Albuterol for emergency use.\n\n2. **For student medications, schools require medical documentation such as a signed Parent Consent/Administration Form and a completed Physician/Prescription Medication Form**: This is supported by multiple passages, including Passage 1, Passage 2, Passage 6, and Passage 10, which all mention the requirement for parental consent and a physician's order or prescription for medication administration at school.\n\n3. **These forms ensure the health and safety of all students and must be renewed each school year**: The requirement for renewal is mentioned in Passage 1 and Passage 6, supporting this claim.\n\n4. **Schools also need permission for students to carry emergency medications like inhalers or Epi-Pens, with a written statement from the student's physician and parent or guardian**: This is supported by Passage 5 and Passage 6, which discuss the conditions under which students can carry and self-administer medications like inhalers and Epi-Pens.\n\nGiven the analysis, all claims made in the answer are directly supported by the passages. Therefore, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the key components of the question and compare them with the information provided in the generated answer.\n\n1. **Obtaining Emergency Albuterol Supplies**: The ground truth answer specifies that schools in certain areas can obtain a free first round of emergency Albuterol from Beverly Hills Pharmacy with a prescription from their Medical Director. It also provides alternatives for schools without a Medical Director. In contrast, the generated answer mentions obtaining emergency Albuterol supplies through programs like RESCUE, which provides nebulizers and other asthma equipment. This information does not directly match the ground truth, indicating a lack of coverage for the specific method of obtaining Albuterol mentioned in the question.\n\n2. **Medical Documentation Requirements for Student Medications**: The ground truth answer outlines specific requirements for prescription and non-prescription medications, including the need for a medication consent form (Form 1A) signed by both parent and physician for prescription medications, and original containers for all medications. The generated answer mentions the need for a signed Parent Consent/Administration Form and a completed Physician/Prescription Medication Form, which aligns with the general requirement for medical documentation but does not specify the details about original containers or the distinction between prescription and non-prescription medications as clearly as the ground truth.\n\n3. **Relevance and Coverage**: The generated answer introduces the program RESCUE, which, while potentially relevant to asthma management in schools, does not directly address the method of obtaining emergency Albuterol supplies as described in the ground truth. For medical documentation, the generated answer covers the necessity of parental and physician consent but lacks specificity regarding the types of medications and the requirement for original containers.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: The generated answer provides some relevant information regarding the need for medical documentation for student medications but fails to accurately cover the specific details about obtaining emergency Albuterol supplies as outlined in the ground truth. Additionally, it introduces information (the RESCUE program) that, while related to school health services, does not directly answer the question about Albuterol supplies.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is not entirely correct and contains some irrelevant information regarding the specific question about obtaining emergency Albuterol supplies. However, it does touch upon the general theme of medical documentation requirements for student medications, albeit with less specificity than the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0.5",
