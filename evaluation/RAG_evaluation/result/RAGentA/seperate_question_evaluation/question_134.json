  "question": "How do the approaches to experience and age limitations compare between the International Criminal Court's judicial selection and Wellbody Clinic's traditional birth attendant program?",
  "generated_answer": "In summary, the ICC prioritizes legal experience and competence in criminal law, with discussions around age limits, while the Wellbody Clinic focuses on practical experience in childbirth without explicit age limitations.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The approaches are notably different. The International Criminal Court panel suggests implementing age limits for judges and strictly requires specific types of professional experience, such as courtroom experience for List A candidates, even rejecting candidates with extensive related expertise but without direct involvement in criminal proceedings. In contrast, Wellbody Clinic takes a more inclusive approach with traditional birth attendants, valuing their experience regardless of formal training or age, focusing instead on their community connections and cultural knowledge. The clinic recognizes that TBAs' years of experience in their communities, even without formal medical training, make them valuable assets in providing maternal healthcare services when properly integrated with trained medical staff.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim about the ICC prioritizing legal experience and competence in criminal law, with discussions around age limits:**\n   - The passages (especially Passage 1) discuss the criteria for electing judges to the International Criminal Court (ICC), emphasizing the importance of proven competence in criminal law and procedure. However, the passages do not explicitly mention \"discussions around age limits\" in the context of ICC judicial selection. Passage 4 mentions age limits (between 24 and 45 years) for the United Nations International Law Fellowship Programme, but this is not directly related to ICC judicial selection.\n\n2. **Claim about the Wellbody Clinic focusing on practical experience in childbirth without explicit age limitations:**\n   - Passage 2 introduces the Wellbody Clinic and mentions a traditional birth attendant, Finda Samuel, who has 15 years of experience delivering babies. It does not explicitly discuss age limitations for the clinic's programs or staff. The focus is indeed on practical experience, as implied by Samuel's extensive experience.\n\nGiven the analysis, the first claim about the ICC has partial support from the passages, particularly regarding the emphasis on legal experience and competence. However, the mention of \"discussions around age limits\" in this context is not supported. The second claim about the Wellbody Clinic is partially supported, as the clinic's focus on practical experience is evident, but there's no direct discussion of age limitations.\n\nConsidering the evaluation, the answer does not fully align with the information provided in the passages, especially regarding the age limit discussions for the ICC. However, it does capture the essence of the ICC's focus on legal competence and the Wellbody Clinic's emphasis on practical experience.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the key components of the ground truth answer and compare them with the generated answer.\n\n1. **Coverage of Vital Information**: The ground truth answer highlights two main points:\n   - The International Criminal Court (ICC) has specific requirements for judges, including age limits and strict professional experience criteria, such as courtroom experience.\n   - Wellbody Clinic takes an inclusive approach with traditional birth attendants (TBAs), valuing their community experience and cultural knowledge over formal training or age.\n\nThe generated answer touches on the ICC's prioritization of legal experience and competence in criminal law and mentions discussions around age limits. It also notes that the Wellbody Clinic focuses on practical experience in childbirth without explicit age limitations. However, it lacks detailed information about the ICC's strict requirements and the specific value Wellbody Clinic places on community connections and cultural knowledge of TBAs.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by comparing the approaches of the ICC and Wellbody Clinic regarding experience and age limitations. It does not contain unnecessary information but also does not fully capture the nuances and details provided in the ground truth answer.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in its basic comparison but lacks the depth and specific details found in the ground truth answer. It does not fully cover the vital information, such as the ICC's rejection of candidates without direct courtroom experience and the clinic's emphasis on community connections and cultural knowledge. However, it remains relevant to the question asked.\n\nTherefore, the generated answer is partially correct and relevant but does not fully capture the complexity of the ground truth answer. This situation suggests a score that reflects correctness but with significant omissions.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
