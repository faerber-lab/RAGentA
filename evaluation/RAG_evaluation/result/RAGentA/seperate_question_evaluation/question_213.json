  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth answer specifies six fundamental values essential for sustainable development as declared by the United Nations: freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature, and shared responsibility. The generated answer, however, lists eight values: Equity and Inclusion, Environmental Stewardship, Economic Prosperity, Social Well-being, Partnership and Collaboration, Transparency and Accountability, Respect for Human Rights, and Intergenerational Responsibility. While some of these values can be indirectly related to the ones mentioned in the ground truth (e.g., Environmental Stewardship can be linked to respect for nature, and Equity and Inclusion can be related to equality), the generated answer does not directly cover the specific values mentioned in the ground truth. It introduces additional concepts that, although relevant to sustainable development in a broader sense, do not directly correspond to the six values outlined by the UN.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is relevant to the topic of sustainable development and the values important for it. However, it does not directly address the question's apparent request for the specific values as declared by the United Nations. The answer provides a comprehensive overview of values that are indeed important for sustainable development but does so in a manner that does not align with the ground truth's focus on the six specific UN-declared values.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer contains a significant amount of relevant information regarding sustainable development but fails to directly address the question as posed, which asks for the values important for sustainable development as declared by the UN. The answer includes additional, albeit relevant, information not specified in the ground truth, making it not entirely accurate to the question's request for the specific UN-declared values.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
