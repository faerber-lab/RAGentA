  "question": "According to social psychology research, how does the presence of others affect task performance?",
  "generated_answer": "The presence of others can have varying effects on task performance, depending on the nature of the task and the individual's familiarity with it. According to social psychology research, when individuals perform tasks they are already skilled at, the presence of others can lead to social facilitation, improving their performance (Zajonc, 1965 ). This is because the increased arousal from the presence of others enhances the dominant response, which is the action most likely to be emitted in a given situation. Conversely, for tasks that are unfamiliar or complex, the presence of others can lead to social inhibition, impairing performance (Zajonc, 1965 The mere presence effect, a related concept, suggests that the presence of others, even if they are not actively evaluating the individual, can still influence behavior (Bond & Titus, 1983",
  "ground_truth_answer": "According to Zajonc's research, when a task is simple and people feel capable, their performance improves in the presence of others. However, if they feel less capable or the task is challenging, performance declines due to increased anxiety. Studies by Sanna and Shotland found that people's perception of how others would evaluate them either stimulated better performance in expectation of approval or led to poor performance in expectation of negative evaluation.",

The answer accurately reflects the concepts of social facilitation, social inhibition, and the mere presence effect as discussed in the passages, including the specific references to Zajonc (1965) and Bond & Titus (1983).\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": 1.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers a significant portion of the vital information from the ground truth. It mentions that the presence of others can have varying effects on task performance, depending on the nature of the task and the individual's familiarity with it. This aligns with the ground truth that performance improves for simple tasks when individuals feel capable but declines for challenging tasks or when individuals feel less capable. The generated answer specifically references Zajonc's research (1965) regarding social facilitation for familiar tasks and social inhibition for unfamiliar or complex tasks, which is directly related to the ground truth. However, it does not explicitly mention the aspect of feeling \"less capable\" or the impact of expected evaluation by others as mentioned in the studies by Sanna and Shotland. Despite this, the core concept of task performance being influenced by the presence of others, based on task complexity and individual skill level, is well-covered.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is directly addressing the question without unnecessary information. It stays focused on explaining how the presence of others affects task performance, referencing specific research to support its claims. The mention of the \"mere presence effect\" and the reference to Bond & Titus (1983) could be seen as slightly tangential but still relevant to the broader topic of social psychology and the presence of others influencing behavior. This additional information does not detract from the main points being made about task performance but rather adds a related concept that enhances understanding of the topic.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is largely correct and directly relevant to the question asked. It covers the primary concepts from the ground truth, although it could be more comprehensive in addressing all aspects, such as the role of expected evaluation by others. The inclusion of some additional relevant information does not significantly detract from its correctness but means it's not perfectly streamlined to only include information from the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
