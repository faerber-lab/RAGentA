  "question": "typical storage tank size european residential solar combisystems solar fraction percentage",
  "generated_answer": "European residential solar combisystems typically use storage tanks with capacities of around 200 gallons. The solar fraction, or the portion of the heating demand satisfied by the solar heating system, in these systems is generally between 20% to 30%.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Many residential combisystems in Europe use storage tanks with capacities of approximately 200 gallons. These systems typically achieve an overall solar fraction (portion of heating demand satisfied by solar) of 20% to 30%. While this may seem low, this approach is often more economical and involves less complexity than systems trying to achieve higher solar fractions.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: European residential solar combisystems typically use storage tanks with capacities of around 200 gallons.\n   - **Support**: Passage 8 does not directly mention the typical storage tank size for European residential solar combisystems. However, Passage 4 mentions that \"Many of the combisystems in Europe use storage tanks with capacities of roughly 200 gal.\" This directly supports the claim.\n\n2. **Claim**: The solar fraction, or the portion of the heating demand satisfied by the solar heating system, in these systems is generally between 20% to 30%.\n   - **Support**: Passage 4 also supports this claim by stating, \"These residential systems may only achieve an overall solar fraction of 20% to 30%...\" This directly supports the claim.\n\nGiven that both claims in the answer are directly supported by the passages (specifically Passage 4), the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer mentions that European residential solar combisystems typically use storage tanks with capacities of around 200 gallons. This directly aligns with the ground truth answer, which states the same capacity. Additionally, the generated answer correctly identifies the solar fraction in these systems as being between 20% to 30%, which is also in line with the ground truth. However, the ground truth provides additional context that this solar fraction may seem low but is often more economical and involves less complexity. The generated answer does not include this contextual information. Despite this omission, the generated answer covers the key points regarding storage tank size and solar fraction percentage.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about the typical storage tank size and solar fraction percentage in European residential solar combisystems without including any unnecessary information. It stays focused on the specific details requested by the question.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is largely correct and directly relevant to the question asked. It accurately reports the storage tank size and the solar fraction percentage but lacks some of the contextual information provided in the ground truth answer. Since the question specifically asks for \"typical storage tank size\" and \"solar fraction percentage,\" and the generated answer provides this information accurately without adding unnecessary details, it aligns well with the criteria for a correct and relevant answer.\n\nHowever, because it does not include all the information from the ground truth (such as the reasoning behind the chosen solar fraction range), it might not be considered completely comprehensive. Yet, for the purpose of answering the question as posed, it is sufficient and directly relevant.\n\nGiven the continuous scale provided, a score of 2 indicates a correct and completely relevant answer with no irrelevant information, which this answer achieves in terms of directly answering the question but misses out on some contextual depth. A score of 1 indicates correctness but with irrelevant information or incomplete coverage, which is not entirely the case here since the information provided is directly relevant. Therefore, the generated answer leans towards being correct and relevant but might not fully capture all nuances of the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
