  "ground_truth_answer": "In South Korea, gift-giving involves specific protocols where gifts must be given and received with both hands, and shouldn't be opened in the giver's presence. When visiting homes, bringing small gifts like candy, cakes, or fruit is customary, and gifts should be reciprocated with items of similar value. Bright colors like yellow, red, or green stripes are appropriate for wrapping. These social practices are part of broader cultural considerations that businesses must evaluate when operating internationally, as social factors including customs and values significantly impact business success - similar to how understanding local customs and social norms is crucial for businesses evaluating market opportunities in new locations, whether nearby or thousands of miles away.",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers several key points from the ground truth, such as the importance of using both hands when giving or receiving gifts in South Korea, the preference for bright colors like yellow, red, or green stripes for wrapping paper, and the custom of bringing small gifts when invited to someone's home. These points are vital for understanding gift-giving customs in South Korea. However, the generated answer introduces information about gift-giving customs in other countries (Japan, China, Thailand) and mentions North Korea, which, while relevant to the broader discussion of gift-giving customs across cultures, is not directly related to the specific question about South Korea. The ground truth emphasizes the importance of these customs in the context of business success across different cultures, which the generated answer also touches upon, albeit with additional examples.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about gift-giving customs in South Korea and their role in business success across different cultures. However, it includes information that, while relevant to the broader topic of gift-giving customs and their impact on business, is not directly related to the specific practices in South Korea or the initial question's focus. The mention of North Korea, Japan, China, and Thailand provides additional context but could be seen as slightly tangential to the primary inquiry about South Korea. The discussion on avoiding gifts when meeting with government officials to prevent perceptions of bribery is relevant but not specifically mentioned in the ground truth as part of the South Korean context.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is largely correct and provides useful information relevant to the question. However, it includes some information that, while not incorrect, is not directly addressed in the ground truth or is slightly tangential to the main question about South Korea. Therefore, the answer is correct but contains some irrelevant information, which aligns with a score of 1.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
