  "question": "What are the recommended steps for setting up a new aquarium with proper water conditions, and how should lighting be managed for different types of fish?",
  "generated_answer": "1. Choose the right location for your aquarium, ensuring the surface is stable and level, and the aquarium is not too close to natural light sources to prevent algae growth. 2. Select an appropriate size for your aquarium, considering that larger tanks require less maintenance and are easier to manage. 3. Install a filtration system to maintain water quality, as it is crucial for the health of the fish. 4. Set up a heater to maintain the correct temperature, which varies depending on the type of fish. For tropical fish, aim for 78-80 degrees Fahrenheit, while coldwater fish can tolerate room temperature. 5. Add a substrate like sand or gravel, ensuring it is clean before use. 6. Install lighting, considering that different types of fish have different lighting needs. Tropical fish and plants typically require 12 hours of light per day, while coldwater fish and plants can adapt to seasonal daylight hours. 7. Perform a 50% water change daily during the initial cycle to establish beneficial bacteria. 8. Avoid overfeeding and maintain a regular feeding schedule, ensuring uneaten food is removed to prevent water pollution. 9. Regularly test water parameters such as ammonia, nitrite, and pH to ensure a healthy environment for the fish. 10. Establish a water change schedule, typically 40-50% every two weeks, using conditioned tap water to remove chlorine and chloramines. - Tropical fish and plants require consistent lighting for 12 hours a day to mimic their natural environment. - Coldwater fish and plants can thrive with lighting that matches seasonal daylight hours. - Use appropriate lighting systems that provide adequate light intensity and quality, avoiding excessive heat that can harm the aquarium inhabitants. - Consider using a light timer to maintain consistent lighting schedules. - Avoid direct sunlight exposure to prevent algae growth and maintain stable water temperatures.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "For setting up a new aquarium, start by cleaning the tank without soap, adding rinsed gravel (1 pound per gallon), and filling with dechlorinated room-temperature water. The tank needs proper filtration including mechanical, chemical, and biological filtering. For lighting management, tropical fish and plants need about 12 hours of light daily to recreate their natural habitat conditions. However, coldwater fish like goldfish and dannios require lighting that matches seasonal daylight hours. The lighting schedule must be carefully monitored, especially with heat-producing lights like incandescent bulbs, which can cause dangerous temperature rises if left on too long, particularly in smaller tanks.",
