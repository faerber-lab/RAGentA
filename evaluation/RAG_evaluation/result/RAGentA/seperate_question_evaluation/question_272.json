  "faithfulness_evaluation": "The answer provided is: \"Based on the available information, I cannot provide a relevant answer to this question.\"\n\nTo evaluate the faithfulness of this answer, we need to check if the passages provide any information about the artifacts discovered in the Royal Villa at Ayia Triada's fire destruction layer around 1450 BC.\n\nUpon analyzing the passages, we find that Passage 1 mentions the Royal Villa at Ayia Triada and its destruction by fire in 1450 BC. It also lists some of the artifacts found in the villa's disaster layer, including \"a valuable group of exceptional works of art, precious materials, records in Minoan script and seals. The famous black serpentine vessels, the \"Harvesters' Vase\", the \"Boxers' Vase\" and the \"Chieftain \u2018 s Cup\", the wall paintings depicting the natural landscape, the sarcophagus, the bronze and clay figurines of worshipers and the copper ingots from the Treasury\" are among the most noteworthy findings.\n\nSince the passages do provide relevant information about the artifacts discovered in the Royal Villa at Ayia Triada's fire destruction layer around 1450 BC, the answer's claim that it \"cannot provide a relevant answer to this question\" is not supported by the passages.\n\nHowever, the answer does not make any false claims, it simply states that it cannot provide an answer. Therefore, the faithfulness score should reflect that the answer is not fully supported by the passages, but it is also not entirely incorrect.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.0",
