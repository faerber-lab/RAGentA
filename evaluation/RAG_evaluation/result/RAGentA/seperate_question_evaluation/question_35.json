  "question": "frozen shoulder exercises pain relief",
  "generated_answer": "In conclusion, while exercises can be beneficial for pain relief in frozen shoulder, they should be performed under the guidance of a healthcare professional to ensure they are appropriate for the individual's stage of the condition and do not exacerbate the problem.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "For pain relief, apply moist heat 3-4 times daily and use over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen. Exercise treatments focus on stretching and range of motion, including shoulder stretches, wall crawls, and pulley exercises. Physical therapy starts with pain control using ice, heat, ultrasound, and gentle mobilizations, then progresses to stretching exercises that should be done frequently throughout the day, ideally once every hour.",

  "correctness_score": -1.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth answer provides specific details about exercises and treatments for pain relief in frozen shoulder, including the application of moist heat, use of over-the-counter medications, and specific exercises like shoulder stretches, wall crawls, and pulley exercises. It also mentions the role of physical therapy in pain control and the progression to stretching exercises. In contrast, the generated answer does not mention any of these specific treatments or exercises. Instead, it focuses on the importance of performing exercises under the guidance of a healthcare professional to avoid exacerbating the condition. This means the generated answer lacks coverage of the vital information provided in the ground truth, such as specific exercises and treatments for pain relief.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is somewhat relevant as it discusses the importance of exercising under professional guidance for frozen shoulder pain relief. However, it does not directly address the question's request for specific exercises or methods for pain relief. The answer includes information about not exacerbating the problem, which is relevant but does not fully address the question's scope. The ground truth answer directly addresses the question by providing specific exercises and treatments, making the generated answer less relevant in terms of providing a comprehensive response to the question asked.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not fully cover the vital information from the ground truth and, while somewhat relevant, does not directly address the question with the specificity requested. Therefore, it falls short of being completely correct and relevant.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: -1.0",
