  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claims made in the answer and check if they are supported by the passages.\n\nThe answer claims: \"Odell Brewing Company currently operates three different brewhouse systems in their facilities: a 5-barrel pilot system, a 50-barrel system, and a 120-barrel brewhouse.\"\n\n1. **5-barrel pilot system**: This is supported by Passage 1, which mentions that Odell Brewing \"still operates a five-barrel 'pilot system' in order to experiment and test new beer ideas -- and to brew small-batch beers in its tap room or in collaboration with bars and other businesses.\" Additionally, Passage 2 mentions a \"5-barrel pilot system\" used by Odell Brewing.\n\n2. **50-barrel system**: Passage 1 mentions a \"fifty-barrel system (which is currently mothballed and for sale...)\" indicating that Odell Brewing has used a 50-barrel system in the past, but it does not confirm current operation. Passage 2 states that Odell Brewing \"brews the majority of its beers on a 50-barrel system,\" which suggests current use.\n\n3. **120-barrel brewhouse**: Passage 1 mentions that Odell now runs a \"sophisticated, 120-barrel brewhouse\" after a major expansion and renovation. This directly supports the claim of a 120-barrel brewhouse.\n\nGiven the analysis:\n- The existence and current operation of the 5-barrel pilot system and the 120-barrel brewhouse are directly supported by the passages.\n- The current operation of the 50-barrel system is supported by Passage 2, but Passage 1 indicates it is mothballed, suggesting a potential discrepancy in the details about its current operational status.\n\nConsidering the majority of the claims are directly supported and the minor discrepancy regarding the operational status of the 50-barrel system, the faithfulness of the answer leans towards full support but with a slight adjustment for the ambiguity regarding the 50-barrel system's current use.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.8",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the comparison with the ground truth answer step by step, considering both coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth mentions that Odell Brewing Company has three brewhouses - a 10 barrel pilot system, a 15 barrel system in their RiNo Denver Brewery, and a 150 BBL main brewhouse. The generated answer also states that Odell Brewing Company operates three different brewhouse systems but specifies them as a 5-barrel pilot system, a 50-barrel system, and a 120-barrel brewhouse. While the generated answer correctly identifies the number of brewhouse systems (three), it incorrectly specifies the sizes of these systems. The sizes mentioned in the generated answer (5-barrel, 50-barrel, and 120-barrel) do not match the sizes provided in the ground truth (10 barrel, 15 barrel, and 150 BBL). This discrepancy indicates incomplete or inaccurate coverage of the vital information.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about the number and types of brewhouse systems Odell Brewing Company operates without including any unnecessary information. It stays focused on the query, providing a straightforward answer, albeit with inaccuracies in the specifics.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in the specifics of the brewhouse systems' sizes, despite correctly stating the number of systems and directly addressing the question. Therefore, the answer does not fully meet the criteria for correctness and relevance as defined by the scoring guidelines.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: -1.0",
