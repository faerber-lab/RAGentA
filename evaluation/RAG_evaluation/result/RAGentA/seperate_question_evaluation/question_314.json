  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claim made in the answer and compare it to the information provided in the passages.\n\nThe answer claims: \"Nearly 2 million cases were filed in Arizona courts during the 2018 fiscal year.\"\n\nUpon reviewing the passages, we find that Passage 2 directly supports this claim. It states: \"HOW MANY CASES DOES THE ARIZONA COURT SYSTEM HANDLE ANNUALLY? Nearly 2 million cases are filed every year in Arizona Courts. In the 2018 fiscal year, an average of 7,597 cases was filed every working day in Arizona courts totaling over 1.8 million cases.\"\n\nThis passage not only confirms the annual number of cases but also provides specific details for the 2018 fiscal year, mentioning that the total was \"over 1.8 million cases,\" which aligns with the \"nearly 2 million\" claim in the answer.\n\nGiven this direct support from Passage 2, we can conclude that the answer is faithfully grounded in the provided passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": 1.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth answer provides a specific number of cases filed in Arizona courts during the 2018 fiscal year, stating \"over 1.8 million cases\" with additional detail on the average number of cases filed per working day (7,597). The generated answer states \"nearly 2 million cases,\" which is close to but not exactly the same as the ground truth. The generated answer lacks the specific detail about the average number of cases filed per working day but does capture the general magnitude of the total number of cases. Thus, in terms of coverage, the generated answer partially covers the vital information from the ground truth, missing the precise figure and the additional detail.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about the total number of cases filed in Arizona courts during the 2018 fiscal year without including any unnecessary information. It stays focused on providing a quantitative answer to the question posed, which aligns well with the relevance criterion.\n\nConsidering both aspects, the generated answer is not entirely accurate in terms of the specific number (it says \"nearly 2 million\" instead of \"over 1.8 million\") but is relevant and close enough to be considered a reasonable approximation of the ground truth. It lacks the complete detail provided in the ground truth but does not introduce irrelevant information.\n\nGiven the continuous scale provided for evaluation:\n- The answer is not a perfect match to the ground truth, so it cannot be scored as 2.\n- It does provide a relevant answer but with a slight inaccuracy and omission of detailed information, which suggests it's more than just incorrect (-1) but not fully correct and detailed (2).\n- The answer does not say \"no answer provided,\" so a score of 0 is not applicable.\n\nTherefore, considering the proximity of \"nearly 2 million\" to \"over 1.8 million\" and the lack of unnecessary information, the generated answer seems to lean towards being correct but with a minor deviation and lack of full detail, which might suggest a score towards the positive end of the scale but not at the maximum.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
