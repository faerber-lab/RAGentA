  "question": "callipyge sheep muscle food efficiency",
  "generated_answer": "The callipyge mutation in sheep results in unusually large and muscular bottoms, and it enables these sheep to convert food into muscle 30% more efficiently than normal sheep. This increased efficiency is due to the unique mode of inheritance known as paternal polar overdominance. The callipyge gene was discovered in a flock of sheep in Oklahoma in the early 1980s, and it was found to be located on a small region near the telomere of sheep chromosome 18. The discovery of the callipyge mutation has significant implications for breeding practices, as it could lead to the development of sheep breeds that are more efficient at converting feed into muscle mass. Furthermore, the study of the callipyge gene could provide insights into the processes that give rise to obesity and fat metabolism, potentially benefiting both agricultural practices and human health research. In summary, callipyge sheep have a genetic mutation that enhances their muscle food efficiency, making them a valuable subject for agricultural research and breeding programs.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **The callipyge mutation in sheep results in unusually large and muscular bottoms**: This claim is supported by Passage 1, which describes the callipyge mutation as resulting in sheep with \"unusually big and muscular bottoms.\"\n\n2. **It enables these sheep to convert food into muscle 30% more efficiently than normal sheep**: This claim is also supported by Passage 1, stating that the callipyge gene \"enables the sheep to convert food into muscle 30% more efficiently than normal sheep.\"\n\n3. **This increased efficiency is due to the unique mode of inheritance known as paternal polar overdominance**: Passage 1 mentions that the callipyge phenotype is an imprinted trait expressed in a unique parent-of-origin dependent manner known as paternal polar overdominance, supporting this claim.\n\n4. **The callipyge gene was discovered in a flock of sheep in Oklahoma in the early 1980s**: This is supported by Passage 1, which states that the callipyge gene was found in a flock of sheep in Oklahoma in the early 1980s.\n\n5. **It was found to be located on a small region near the telomere of sheep chromosome 18**: Passage 1 confirms this, mentioning that the mutation was located on a small region near the telomere of sheep chromosome 18.\n\n6. **The discovery of the callipyge mutation has significant implications for breeding practices, as it could lead to the development of sheep breeds that are more efficient at converting feed into muscle mass**: While the passages do not directly state the implications for breeding practices in these exact words, Passage 1 suggests that the callipyge gene \"could prove beneficial in breeding\" because of its efficiency in converting food into muscle.\n\n7. **The study of the callipyge gene could provide insights into the processes that give rise to obesity and fat metabolism, potentially benefiting both agricultural practices and human health research**: Passage 1 supports this by stating that the study of the gene could also provide insights into the processes that give rise to obesity and fat metabolism.\n\nGiven the analysis, all claims made in the answer are directly supported by the information provided in Passage 1, with no claims being unsupported or contradicted by the passages. Therefore, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": 1.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth answer states that sheep with the callipyge gene can convert food into muscle 30% more efficiently than normal sheep. The generated answer includes this specific detail, thereby covering the vital information from the ground truth. It not only mentions the 30% increased efficiency in food conversion to muscle but also provides additional context about the callipyge gene, its discovery, and its implications. Therefore, in terms of coverage, the generated answer fully includes the information present in the ground truth.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The question asks about the callipyge sheep's muscle food efficiency. The generated answer directly addresses this question by stating the increased efficiency in food conversion to muscle. However, it also includes a significant amount of additional information about the unique mode of inheritance, the discovery of the gene, its location on the sheep chromosome, and the potential implications for breeding practices and human health research. While all this information is related to the callipyge gene and its effects, not all of it directly pertains to the question of muscle food efficiency. This means the answer contains both relevant and somewhat irrelevant information regarding the specific question asked.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in that it accurately includes the information from the ground truth about the increased efficiency of food conversion to muscle in callipyge sheep. However, it also contains additional information that, while related, is not directly relevant to the question of muscle food efficiency. Therefore, the answer is correct but includes irrelevant information.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
