  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the process into steps considering the aspects of coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Understanding the Ground Truth**: The ground truth answer provides detailed information about the capital of the Ashanti Kingdom, specifying that Kumasi was designated as the capital by Okomfo Anokye and Osei Tutu when they established the state. This gives us a full context of not just the location but also the historical figures involved in its designation.\n\n2. **Analyzing the Generated Answer**: The generated answer states, \"The capital of the Ashanti Kingdom was Kumasi.\" This answer directly addresses the question by providing the name of the capital.\n\n3. **Evaluating Coverage**: The generated answer covers the essential part of the ground truth, which is the identification of Kumasi as the capital of the Ashanti Kingdom. However, it lacks the additional historical context provided in the ground truth about Okomfo Anokye and Osei Tutu. Despite this, the core information requested by the question (the location of the capital) is fully present.\n\n4. **Evaluating Relevance**: The generated answer is directly relevant to the question asked. It does not contain any unnecessary information, making it a concise and accurate response to the query about the capital's location.\n\n5. **Determining Correctness**: Given that the generated answer accurately identifies Kumasi as the capital of the Ashanti Kingdom and does so without including any irrelevant information, it aligns well with the criteria for a correct answer. The lack of additional historical context does not detract from the answer's correctness regarding the question's specific ask.\n\n6. **Scoring**: Considering the generated answer provides all the vital information requested by the question (the capital's name) and does so in a relevant manner without unnecessary details, it deserves a high score. However, because it does not include the full scope of information from the ground truth (such as the founders), one might argue it's not \"completely\" relevant in the context of all possible information. Yet, for the question as posed, the answer is both correct and directly relevant.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is best described as correct and completely relevant to the question asked, without any unnecessary information.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
