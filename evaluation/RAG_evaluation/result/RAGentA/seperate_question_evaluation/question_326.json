  "question": "weight load capacity panasonic exoskeleton",
  "generated_answer": "The Panasonic exoskeleton, as mentioned in Document 2, is designed to help workers lift and carry objects more easily and with less risk of injury. It weighs just over 13 pounds and can carry an additional 33 pounds of load. Therefore, the weight load capacity of the Panasonic exoskeleton is 33 pounds (14.97 kg)",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Panasonic's exoskeleton enables the wearer to carry 33 pounds of extra load. The company is also testing a larger suit with ActiveLink designed to help carry loads as heavy as 220 pounds.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The Panasonic exoskeleton is designed to help workers lift and carry objects more easily and with less risk of injury.\n   - **Support**: This claim is directly supported by Passage 1, which states, \"The Japanese company Panasonic announced recently that it will start selling an exoskeleton designed to help workers lift and carry objects more easily and with less risk of injury.\"\n\n2. **Claim**: The exoskeleton weighs just over 13 pounds.\n   - **Support**: This claim is also supported by Passage 1, which mentions, \"It weighs just over 13 pounds and attaches to the back, thighs, and feet, enabling the wearer to carry 33 pounds of extra load.\"\n\n3. **Claim**: The exoskeleton can carry an additional 33 pounds of load.\n   - **Support**: Supported by Passage 1, as mentioned above.\n\n4. **Claim**: Therefore, the weight load capacity of the Panasonic exoskeleton is 33 pounds (14.97 kg).\n   - **Support**: This conclusion is directly supported by the information provided in Passage 1.\n\nGiven the analysis, all claims made in the answer are directly supported by the information provided in Passage 1. There is no claim that lacks support or is contradicted by the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth answer mentions two key pieces of information regarding the weight load capacity of Panasonic's exoskeletons: the standard exoskeleton can help the wearer carry an extra 33 pounds, and a larger suit is being tested for carrying loads up to 220 pounds. The generated answer only mentions the 33 pounds capacity, omitting the information about the larger suit designed for heavier loads (220 pounds). Thus, the generated answer covers only a portion of the vital information provided in the ground truth.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about the weight load capacity of the Panasonic exoskeleton by stating it can carry an additional 33 pounds of load. However, it also includes the weight of the exoskeleton itself (just over 13 pounds), which, while related to the exoskeleton, is not directly relevant to the question about its weight load capacity. The conversion of 33 pounds to kilograms (14.97 kg) is relevant as it provides the weight in another unit of measurement, which could be seen as useful but not strictly necessary for answering the question.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is correct in stating the 33-pound load capacity but lacks completeness by not mentioning the 220-pound capacity of the larger suit. It also contains a bit of irrelevant information (the weight of the exoskeleton itself). Therefore, the answer is not entirely accurate or comprehensive regarding the ground truth but does correctly state one part of the information.\n\nGiven the scale provided:\n- The answer is not a -1 because it does provide a correct piece of information.\n- It's not a 0 because it does attempt to answer the question.\n- It's not a 2 because it lacks complete coverage of the ground truth information and includes some irrelevant details.\n- It best fits a 1 because it is correct but contains irrelevant information and lacks full coverage of the vital details from the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
