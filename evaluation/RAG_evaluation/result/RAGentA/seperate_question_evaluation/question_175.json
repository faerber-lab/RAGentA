  "question": "injury rate soccer compared american football which sport more injuries",
  "generated_answer": "The injury rate in soccer is generally lower than in American football. Soccer players are more likely to sustain injuries to the lower body, such as knee and ankle injuries, while American football players are at higher risk for injuries to the upper extremities and cervical spine. Concussions are equally likely in both sports.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Both soccer and American football are considered high-risk sports, but football appears to have higher injury risk. While soccer shows significant injury rates (35.3 injuries per 1000 hours during games), American football is described as 'the most risky sport' with most injuries due to collisions. Football has higher risks of catastrophic injuries, particularly from head contact in blocking and tackling, and poses significant risks of long-term osteoarthritis of the knee and hip from major injuries.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down each claim and compare it to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The injury rate in soccer is generally lower than in American football.\n   - **Support**: PASSAGE 2 mentions that football was ranked as the third most dangerous sport in 2011 by the Bleacher Report, while soccer was ranked sixth. Additionally, PASSAGE 2 provides statistics showing more emergency room visits for football injuries than for soccer injuries among children. This supports the claim.\n\n2. **Claim**: Soccer players are more likely to sustain injuries to the lower body, such as knee and ankle injuries.\n   - **Support**: PASSAGE 1, PASSAGE 2, PASSAGE 5, and PASSAGE 9 all mention that soccer players are prone to injuries of the lower body, including knees and ankles. This claim is well-supported.\n\n3. **Claim**: American football players are at higher risk for injuries to the upper extremities and cervical spine.\n   - **Support**: PASSAGE 1 specifically mentions that the risk of injury to the upper extremities is much higher in football than in soccer and notes that football players are more likely to suffer injuries to the cervical spine. This claim is supported.\n\n4. **Claim**: Concussions are equally likely in both sports.\n   - **Support**: PASSAGE 1 states that concussion injuries are equally likely in soccer and football players. PASSAGE 2 also provides statistics showing that 13% of soccer and football injuries involved concussions among certain age groups, supporting this claim.\n\nGiven the analysis, all claims made in the answer are supported by the passages. Therefore, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the key points from the ground truth and compare them with the information provided in the generated answer.\n\n1. **Injury Rate Comparison**: The ground truth states that American football appears to have a higher injury risk compared to soccer, with soccer showing significant injury rates but American football being described as 'the most risky sport'. In contrast, the generated answer claims that the injury rate in soccer is generally lower than in American football, which aligns with the ground truth's implication but does not fully capture the comparative risk levels as described.\n\n2. **Types of Injuries**: The ground truth mentions that American football has higher risks of catastrophic injuries, particularly from head contact, and significant risks of long-term osteoarthritis. The generated answer discusses the likelihood of injuries to different body parts in each sport (lower body in soccer, upper extremities and cervical spine in American football) and mentions concussions being equally likely in both sports. While this provides some relevant information about the nature of injuries in each sport, it does not directly address the comparative severity or the specific risks (like head contact and osteoarthritis) mentioned in the ground truth.\n\n3. **Coverage and Relevance**: The generated answer partially covers the vital information from the ground truth by acknowledging that American football has a higher injury risk and discussing types of injuries. However, it lacks detailed information about the severity and specific risks associated with each sport as outlined in the ground truth. The generated answer is somewhat relevant but introduces the comparison of injury locations and concussion risks without fully addressing the question's focus on overall injury rates and comparative risk levels.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is not entirely incorrect but also does not fully capture the essential points from the ground truth. It provides some relevant information but misses key details about the comparative severity of injuries and specific risks associated with American football.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: -1.0",
