  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: Lee Brice has been more actively involved in the ACM Awards, with multiple nominations and wins.\n   - **Support**: Passages 1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10 mention Lee Brice in the context of the ACM Awards, including nominations and performances. This suggests that Lee Brice is indeed actively involved with the ACM Awards.\n\n2. **Claim**: Holly Dunn's recognition has been more through her career achievements and membership in the Grand Ole Opry.\n   - **Support**: Passage 2 discusses Holly Dunn's career, including her membership in the Grand Ole Opry and her songwriting achievements. However, there's no direct comparison or mention of her involvement with the ACM Awards in the provided passages.\n\nGiven these observations:\n\n- The first claim about Lee Brice's involvement with the ACM Awards is well-supported by multiple passages.\n- The second claim about Holly Dunn's recognition is partially supported, as it mentions her achievements and Grand Ole Opry membership but lacks direct comparison to her involvement with the ACM Awards.\n\nSince some claims are well-supported and others are partially supported or lack direct comparison, the faithfulness of the answer is not fully confirmed but also not entirely unsupported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.5",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the comparison between Lee Brice and Holly Dunn regarding the ACM Awards as per the ground truth and the generated answer.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth provides specific details about the recognition both artists received from the ACM Awards. Holly Dunn was named the ACM's Top New Female Vocalist in 1986. Lee Brice received nominations for Song of the Year for 'Love Like Crazy' and Single Record of the Year in 2011, as well as Top New Male Artist and Song of the Year for 'A Woman Like You' in 2013. The generated answer, however, does not specify these achievements. It mentions that Lee Brice has been more actively involved in the ACM Awards with multiple nominations and wins, which is partially correct but lacks the specificity of the ground truth. It also incorrectly implies that Lee Brice has won awards, which the ground truth does not confirm. For Holly Dunn, the generated answer mentions her career achievements and membership in the Grand Ole Opry, which is not relevant to the comparison of their involvement with the ACM Awards as requested by the question.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer introduces information about the artists' overall contributions to country music and Holly Dunn's membership in the Grand Ole Opry, which is not directly relevant to the question about their comparison regarding the ACM Awards. The question specifically asks for a comparison of Lee Brice and Holly Dunn in the context of the ACM Awards, not their broader careers or other achievements.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer fails to provide the specific details about the ACM Awards recognition for both artists as outlined in the ground truth. It also introduces irrelevant information, making it less relevant to the question asked.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: -1.0",
