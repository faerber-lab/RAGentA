  "question": "Were both Maeshowe and the Nebra Sky Disc discovered through official archaeological excavations?",
  "generated_answer": "Maeshowe was first excavated by archaeologist James Farrer in 1861, which was before it was taken into state care in 1910. The Nebra Sky Disc was discovered in 1999 in an illegal excavation.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "No, they were discovered differently. Maeshowe was first excavated officially by archaeologist James Farrer in 1861. In contrast, the Nebra Sky Disc was found illegally by treasure hunters in 1999, who then attempted to sell it before it was recovered through a police operation and given to its rightful owner, the state of Sachsen-Anhalt.",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the key components of the question and the ground truth answer, and then compare them with the generated answer.\n\n1. **Coverage of Vital Information**: The question asks whether both Maeshowe and the Nebra Sky Disc were discovered through official archaeological excavations. The ground truth answer provides detailed information on how each was discovered: Maeshowe was officially excavated by James Farrer in 1861, and the Nebra Sky Disc was found illegally by treasure hunters in 1999. The generated answer mentions that Maeshowe was first excavated by James Farrer in 1861 and that the Nebra Sky Disc was discovered in 1999 in an illegal excavation. Thus, it covers the essential information about the discovery methods of both artifacts.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by stating the discovery methods for both Maeshowe and the Nebra Sky Disc without diverting into unnecessary details. However, it does mention the year Maeshowe was taken into state care (1910), which, while related to Maeshowe's history, is not directly relevant to the question of how these artifacts were discovered.\n\n3. **Accuracy and Completeness**: The generated answer accurately conveys that Maeshowe was discovered through an official excavation and the Nebra Sky Disc through illegal means. It lacks the detail about the Nebra Sky Disc being recovered through a police operation and given to the state of Sachsen-Anhalt, but this omission does not affect the core answer to the question.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is correct in stating the discovery methods for both artifacts, which directly answers the question. However, it includes a piece of information (the year Maeshowe was taken into state care) that is not directly relevant to the question asked. The omission of details about the Nebra Sky Disc's recovery does not detract from the answer's correctness regarding the discovery methods.\n\nGiven the criteria, the generated answer would score high because it correctly addresses the question's core, despite containing a minor irrelevant detail and lacking some secondary information about the Nebra Sky Disc's post-discovery handling.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
