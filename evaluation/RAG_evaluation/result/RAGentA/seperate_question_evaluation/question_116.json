  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The question asks for the height of the Kasikasima Mountain. The ground truth answer provides that Kasikasima is a unique granitic mountain formation and that it rises over 2,300 feet (700 meters) above the rainforest. The generated answer directly states that the Kasikasima Mountain rises over 2,300 feet (700 meters) above the rainforest in Suriname. Therefore, the generated answer covers the vital information regarding the height of the mountain as provided in the ground truth.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing the height of the Kasikasima Mountain without including unnecessary information. The mention of Suriname in the generated answer is relevant because it was part of the question's context, helping to identify the specific Kasikasima Mountain being referred to. The ground truth also mentions that Kasikasima is a \"unique granitic mountain formation,\" but this detail, while interesting, is not directly relevant to the question of the mountain's height. The generated answer omits this detail, which can be seen as maintaining relevance to the question asked.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is both correct and directly relevant to the question asked. It does not contain unnecessary information that would detract from its correctness or relevance. Therefore, the generated answer should be scored as correct and completely relevant.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
