  "question": "What are the specific water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) for Parylene-N, Parylene-C, and Parylene-D in terms of g.mm/m2.day?",
  "generated_answer": "- Parylene-N: 0.59 g.mm/m2.day - Parylene-C: 0.08 g.mm/m2.day - Parylene-D: 0.09 g.mm/m2.day",
  "ground_truth_answer": "According to the data, Parylene-N has a water vapor transmission rate of 0.59 g.mm/m2.day, Parylene-C has 0.08 g.mm/m2.day, and Parylene-D has 0.09 g.mm/m2.day.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's analyze each claim:\n\n1. **Parylene-N: 0.59 g.mm/m2.day** - This claim is directly supported by Passage 1, Table I, which lists the water vapor transmission rate for Parylene-N as 0.59 (g.mm)/(m2.day).\n\n2. **Parylene-C: 0.08 g.mm/m2.day** - This claim is also directly supported by Passage 1, Table I, which lists the water vapor transmission rate for Parylene-C as 0.08 (g.mm)/(m2.day).\n\n3. **Parylene-D: 0.09 g.mm/m2.day** - Similarly, this claim is supported by Passage 1, Table I, with the water vapor transmission rate for Parylene-D listed as 0.09 (g.mm)/(m2.day).\n\nAll claims in the answer are directly supported by the information provided in Passage 1. There is no contradictory information in any of the other passages regarding these specific water vapor transmission rates for the types of Parylene mentioned.\n\nGiven that all claims are directly supported by the passages, the faithfulness of the answer is at its highest level.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": 2.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The question asks for the specific water vapor transmission rates (WVTR) for Parylene-N, Parylene-C, and Parylene-D in terms of g.mm/m2.day. The generated answer provides the WVTR for all three types of Parylene: Parylene-N as 0.59 g.mm/m2.day, Parylene-C as 0.08 g.mm/m2.day, and Parylene-D as 0.09 g.mm/m2.day. This matches the ground truth answer exactly, indicating that the generated answer covers 100% of the vital information requested in the question.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question without including any unnecessary information. It lists the WVTR for each type of Parylene as requested, without providing extraneous details or failing to address any part of the question. This means the answer is completely relevant to the question asked.\n\nGiven these observations, the generated answer is both fully covered in terms of the information requested and is completely relevant, directly answering the question without any unnecessary information.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
