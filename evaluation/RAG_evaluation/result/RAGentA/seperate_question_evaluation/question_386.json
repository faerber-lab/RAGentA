  "question": "what are main types muscles in shoulder girdle",
  "generated_answer": "The main types of muscles in the shoulder girdle are the global movers and the local stabilizers. Global movers are responsible for moving the joints of the shoulder girdle in all directions and consist mainly of fast-twitched muscle fibers that are good at generating force and speed. Local stabilizers, on the other hand, consist mainly of endurance slow twitch muscle fibers, which stabilize the joints of the shoulder girdle in its optimal position so the global movers can generate force efficiently.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "There are two main types of muscles in the shoulder girdle: the global movers and the local stabilizers. Global movers are good at moving your arm and scapula, while local stabilizers stabilize and centralize the humerus inside the glenoidal surface.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The main types of muscles in the shoulder girdle are the global movers and the local stabilizers.\n   - **Support**: This claim is directly supported by PASSAGE 1 and PASSAGE 2, which explicitly mention the global movers and local stabilizers as the two main types of muscles in the shoulder girdle.\n\n2. **Claim**: Global movers are responsible for moving the joints of the shoulder girdle in all directions and consist mainly of fast-twitched muscle fibers that are good at generating force and speed.\n   - **Support**: This claim is supported by PASSAGE 1, which states that global movers have a larger part of fast-twitch muscle fibers, enabling them to generate more force and speed.\n\n3. **Claim**: Local stabilizers consist mainly of endurance slow twitch muscle fibers, which stabilize the joints of the shoulder girdle in its optimal position so the global movers can generate force efficiently.\n   - **Support**: This claim is also supported by PASSAGE 1, indicating that local stabilizers have a larger part of slow-twitch muscle fibers, which are better at maintaining tension over time, thus stabilizing the joints.\n\nGiven the analysis, all claims made in the answer are directly supported by the information provided in the passages, particularly PASSAGE 1 and PASSAGE 2. Therefore, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer mentions the two main types of muscles in the shoulder girdle as the global movers and the local stabilizers, which aligns with the ground truth answer. This indicates good coverage of the vital information regarding the types of muscles. However, the ground truth specifically mentions that global movers are good at moving your arm and scapula, and local stabilizers stabilize and centralize the humerus inside the glenoidal surface. The generated answer provides additional details about the muscle fibers (fast-twitched for global movers and slow-twitched for local stabilizers) and their functions but does not explicitly mention the movement of the arm and scapula or the stabilization of the humerus. Despite this, it covers the primary classification and provides a functional insight, albeit with a slightly different focus.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by identifying the main types of muscles in the shoulder girdle. It provides additional information about the composition (fast-twitched vs. slow-twitched muscle fibers) and the efficiency of force generation by global movers when local stabilizers are functioning properly. While this information is related to muscle function and could be considered relevant in a broader discussion of muscle physiology, it introduces details not present in the ground truth answer. The question seems to focus on the basic classification and primary function of these muscle types in the context of the shoulder girdle. Therefore, the generated answer contains information that, while not incorrect, could be seen as slightly beyond the scope of the question as posed.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is correct in identifying the main types of muscles and provides additional relevant physiological details. However, it does not perfectly align with the ground truth in terms of the specific examples of function (arm and scapula movement, humerus stabilization) and introduces the concept of muscle fiber types, which could be seen as slightly tangential to the question's focus.\n\nGiven the analysis, the generated answer is mostly correct and directly addresses the question but includes additional information not specified in the ground truth. This suggests a score that reflects correctness with some irrelevance.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
