  "question": "Do both osteoarthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica cause joint stiffness?",
  "generated_answer": "Yes, both osteoarthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica can cause joint stiffness. Osteoarthritis, a common form of arthritis, is characterized by stiffness and pain in the joints due to wear and tear on the cartilage. Polymyalgia rheumatica, an inflammatory disorder, causes muscle pain and stiffness, particularly in the neck, shoulders, and hips.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Yes, both conditions cause joint stiffness, but in different ways. In osteoarthritis, joint stiffness is one of the irreversible symptoms that appears after the disease has progressed. In polymyalgia rheumatica, stiffness is a primary symptom, particularly affecting the neck, shoulders, and hips, and is most severe in the morning or after periods of inactivity, typically lasting longer than 30 minutes.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: Osteoarthritis causes joint stiffness.\n   - **Support**: Passage 1 mentions that osteoarthritis is a condition that causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in the joints. This directly supports the claim.\n\n2. **Claim**: Polymyalgia rheumatica causes joint stiffness.\n   - **Support**: Passage 2 states that polymyalgia rheumatica causes inflammation of the joints, leading to pain and stiffness, most often in the neck, shoulders, or hips. This supports the claim, although it specifies the areas most affected.\n\n3. **Claim**: Both conditions can cause joint stiffness.\n   - **Support**: Given that both individual claims are supported by the passages (Passage 1 for osteoarthritis and Passage 2 for polymyalgia rheumatica), this combined claim is also supported.\n\nThe answer accurately reflects information found in the passages regarding the causes of joint stiffness in both osteoarthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica. There are no claims in the answer that contradict the information provided in the passages, and all specific details about the conditions and their effects on the body are consistent with the passage content.\n\nTherefore, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported by the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer correctly identifies that both osteoarthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica can cause joint stiffness. It also provides some details about each condition, such as osteoarthritis being characterized by stiffness and pain due to wear and tear on the cartilage, and polymyalgia rheumatica causing muscle pain and stiffness, particularly in the neck, shoulders, and hips. However, the generated answer lacks specific information present in the ground truth, such as the distinction that in osteoarthritis, joint stiffness is an irreversible symptom appearing after disease progression, and in polymyalgia rheumatica, stiffness is most severe in the morning or after periods of inactivity, typically lasting longer than 30 minutes. Thus, while the generated answer covers the basic fact that both conditions cause joint stiffness, it does not fully capture the nuances and specific details provided in the ground truth.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question of whether both osteoarthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica cause joint stiffness. It provides relevant information about each condition's impact on joint stiffness without including unnecessary details that do not pertain to the question asked. The information given is straightforward and focused on the query, making the answer relevant to the topic at hand.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is correct in stating that both conditions cause joint stiffness but lacks the detailed explanations and specific characteristics of how stiffness manifests in each condition as provided in the ground truth. The answer is directly relevant to the question without unnecessary information but does not fully cover all vital information from the ground truth.\n\nGiven the continuous scale provided:\n- The answer is not a -1 because it is not incorrect; it correctly states that both conditions cause joint stiffness.\n- The answer is not a 0 because it does provide an answer to the question.\n- The answer is not a 2 because, while relevant, it does not completely cover the nuances and specific details about the stiffness in both conditions as outlined in the ground truth.\n- Therefore, the most appropriate score would be a 1, as the answer is correct but contains less detailed information than the ground truth, which could be considered as lacking in completeness rather than containing irrelevant information.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
