  "question": "As someone who studies sensory experiences in entertainment, how do the special effects in Spectra at Marina Bay Sands compare to those in INFINITY attraction?",
  "generated_answer": "The specific special effects used in the INFINITY attraction include strobe-like effects and loud sounds/sound effects. However, the provided documents do not contain sufficient information to directly compare these effects with those in Spectra at Marina Bay Sands. Therefore, while we can describe the sensory-driven experience of the INFINITY attraction, a direct comparison with Spectra remains speculative based on the available information.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Spectra focuses on visual presentations combining laser effects, sparkling fountain jets, and digital arts, telling Singapore's history through four parts. In contrast, INFINITY offers a broader multisensory experience including interactive displays, bizarre soundfields, mind-bending illusions, uneven and moving floors, and various lighting effects including strobe lights and fog effects, making it a more comprehensive sensory experience.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim about the special effects in INFINITY attraction**: The answer mentions strobe-like effects and loud sounds/sound effects, which is supported by Passage 1. This passage lists \"strobe like effects\" and \"Loud Sounds/ sound effects\" among the features of the INFINITY attraction.\n\n2. **Claim about the lack of information for direct comparison with Spectra at Marina Bay Sands**: The answer states that the provided documents do not contain sufficient information to directly compare the special effects in INFINITY attraction with those in Spectra at Marina Bay Sands. Upon reviewing the passages, it's clear that while there is detailed information about the features and attractions of Marina Bay Sands (including its SkyPark, shopping, and casino), there is no specific mention of \"Spectra\" or its special effects in the context of Marina Bay Sands. Therefore, this claim is supported by the passages, as they do not provide a basis for a direct comparison.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer's claims are supported by the passages. The first claim is directly supported by Passage 1, and the second claim is supported by the lack of relevant information in the passages regarding \"Spectra\" at Marina Bay Sands.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a comparison and the answer indicates that such a comparison cannot be made due to a lack of information, the support is not full in the sense that it does not provide a direct answer to the question asked. It explains the situation based on the available information but does not fulfill the request for a comparison.\n\nConsidering this, the faithfulness score should reflect that the answer is based on the information provided in the passages but does not fully address the question due to the limitations acknowledged in the answer itself.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.5",
  "correctness_score": 0.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer lacks detailed information about the special effects in Spectra at Marina Bay Sands and how they compare to those in INFINITY attraction. It mentions that the provided documents do not contain sufficient information to directly compare these effects, which indicates a significant gap in coverage. The ground truth answer provides a clear comparison, highlighting that Spectra focuses on visual presentations, while INFINITY offers a broader multisensory experience. The generated answer fails to cover this vital information, resulting in low coverage.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is somewhat relevant as it attempts to address the question by mentioning the special effects in INFINITY attraction. However, it does not provide a direct comparison with Spectra at Marina Bay Sands due to claimed insufficient information. This makes the answer partially relevant but incomplete in terms of fully addressing the question asked.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer does not fully meet the criteria for correctness and relevance. It does not provide the necessary information to compare the special effects between Spectra and INFINITY attraction, which is the core of the question. The answer essentially states that a comparison cannot be made due to lack of information, which aligns with a score of 0, as it does not provide a substantive answer to the question.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 0.0",
