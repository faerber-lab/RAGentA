  "question": "I need help with mobile app testing - between Kobiton and Serverless Chrome, which one specializes in mobile testing capabilities?",
  "generated_answer": "Kobiton specializes in mobile testing capabilities.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Kobiton is specifically designed for mobile testing, while Serverless Chrome is not focused on mobile applications. Kobiton is a mobile testing platform that provides comprehensive mobile visual validation and Visual UX testing solutions, built specifically for optimizing mobile UI by searching for visual bugs. It offers features like scriptless automation, visual and text affirmations, and local device connections. Serverless Chrome, in contrast, is primarily focused on running headless Chrome on AWS Lambda for web-based tasks like taking screenshots and printing to PDF. For mobile testing needs, Kobiton would be the more appropriate choice with pricing starting at $500 per year for teams wanting immediate access to real-world devices.",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer, \"Kobiton specializes in mobile testing capabilities,\" directly addresses the question by identifying Kobiton as the platform that specializes in mobile testing. However, it lacks the comprehensive details provided in the ground truth answer, such as the specific features of Kobiton (like scriptless automation, visual and text affirmations, and local device connections), the contrast with Serverless Chrome's focus, and the pricing information. Despite this, the core information needed to answer the question is present.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is directly relevant to the question asked. It does not contain any unnecessary or irrelevant information. The answer is concise and focuses solely on identifying Kobiton as the platform specializing in mobile testing capabilities, which is exactly what the question seeks to know.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in identifying Kobiton as the platform for mobile testing but lacks the detailed explanation and contrast provided in the ground truth. However, since the question is about which platform specializes in mobile testing capabilities, and the answer directly and correctly addresses this without providing any incorrect or irrelevant information, it aligns well with the criteria for a correct answer.\n\nThe generated answer does not provide a complete picture as the ground truth does, but it does not mislead or provide incorrect information either. Therefore, considering the scale provided:\n\n- It's not a -1 because the answer is not incorrect.\n- It's not a 0 because an answer is provided.\n- It's not a 2 because, although correct and relevant, it lacks comprehensive details found in the ground truth.\n- It's a 1 because the answer is correct but could be considered to lack some relevant details that would make it a fully informative response.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
