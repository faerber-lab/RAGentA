  "question": "I recently got a grant from my state government back home. Does this make me subject to the 2-year home residency requirement?",
  "generated_answer": "Receiving funding from your state government does not automatically make you subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. According to Document 2, J Exchange Visitors who receive funding directly from their home country's government are subject to the 212(e) requirement. However, Document 6 clarifies that 212(e) typically pertains to direct funding from the home country's government, not necessarily state governments. Therefore, without specific information indicating that your state government funding is considered equivalent to direct funding from your home country's government, you are not necessarily subject to the requirement.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "No, regional government funding does not make you subject to the 2-year home residency requirement (212(e)). Only funding received directly from your home country's national government would make you subject to this requirement.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: Receiving funding from your state government does not automatically make you subject to the 2-year home residency requirement.\n   - **Support**: Passage 1 mentions that \"Regional government funding does not apply\" when discussing conditions that subject J-1 Exchange Visitors to the 212(e) requirement. This directly supports the claim.\n\n2. **Claim**: According to Document 2, J Exchange Visitors who receive funding directly from their home country's government are subject to the 212(e) requirement.\n   - **Support**: Passage 2 (referred to here as \"Document 2\") indeed states that if Exchange Visitors are funded in whole or in part by their home country\u2019s government, they will be subject to the Two-Year Home Residence Requirement. This supports the claim.\n\n3. **Claim**: Document 6 clarifies that 212(e) typically pertains to direct funding from the home country's government, not necessarily state governments.\n   - **Support**: While Passage 6 discusses the applicability of the two-year foreign residence requirements to certain NIW physicians and the conditions under which they can be waived, it does not directly address the distinction between state and home country government funding in the context of the 212(e) requirement as clearly as Passage 1 does. However, the general understanding from Passage 1 that regional (which could be interpreted to include state) government funding does not apply, indirectly supports the notion that the requirement is more about direct home country government funding.\n\n4. **Claim**: Without specific information indicating that your state government funding is considered equivalent to direct funding from your home country's government, you are not necessarily subject to the requirement.\n   - **Support**: This claim is logically consistent with the information provided in the passages, especially Passage 1, which distinguishes between funding sources and their implications for the 212(e) requirement. However, it's more of an inference based on the distinction between regional and home country government funding rather than a direct statement from the passages.\n\nGiven the analysis, the answer's claims are largely supported by the passages, especially the critical distinction between types of government funding and their implications for the 2-year home residency requirement. The only potential for partial support rather than full support comes from the indirect nature of some support and the necessity of making logical inferences based on the information provided. However, the core claims are directly supported, leading to a high faithfulness score.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.8",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers the essential information from the ground truth, which is that receiving funding from a state government does not automatically make one subject to the 2-year home residency requirement. It also correctly implies that only funding directly from the home country's national government would trigger this requirement. Therefore, the vital information from the ground truth is largely present in the generated answer.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question without providing unnecessary information. It mentions specific documents (Document 2 and Document 6) which might seem like additional information, but in this context, they are used to support the explanation and clarify the distinction between national and state government funding. This reference to documents could be seen as slightly irrelevant because the ground truth answer does not mention them, but they do help in reinforcing the correctness of the statement made in the generated answer.\n\n3. **Accuracy and Clarity**: The generated answer is accurate in stating that funding from a state government does not automatically subject one to the 2-year home residency requirement. It also clarifies that the requirement typically pertains to direct funding from the home country's government. The answer is clear and does not introduce any incorrect information.\n\nConsidering these aspects, the generated answer is correct and directly relevant to the question asked. Although it mentions specific documents not referenced in the ground truth, this does not detract from the correctness of the answer but rather supports it with additional context. Therefore, the score should reflect that the answer is correct but contains a minor amount of information not present in the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
