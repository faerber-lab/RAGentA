  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down the claims made in the answer and check if they are supported by the passages.\n\nThe answer claims: \"Wild Country Rocks climbing nuts are available in a wide size range between 1 and 14.\"\n\nFrom PASSAGE 1, we find the following statement: \"Rocks are available in a wide size range between 1 and 14...\" This directly supports the claim made in the answer.\n\nThere is no contradictory information in any of the other passages regarding the size range of Wild Country Rocks climbing nuts. Therefore, the claim made in the answer is fully supported by the passages.\n\nGiven that all claims in the answer are directly supported by the passages, the faithfulness score should reflect full support.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
  "correctness_score": 1.0,
  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the two key aspects: Coverage and Relevance.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth answer mentions that Wild Country Rocks are available in a wide size range between 1 and 14, and also provides additional information that sizes over 10 are not routinely carried unless specifically needed. The generated answer covers the size range (between 1 and 14) but does not mention the part about sizes over 10 not being routinely carried. This means the generated answer does not fully capture all the vital information from the ground truth, particularly the nuance regarding the availability of larger sizes.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about the size options available for Wild Country Rocks climbing nuts without including any unnecessary information. It stays focused on the size range, which is the core of the question asked.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is partially correct because it accurately states the size range but misses an important detail about the availability of larger sizes. However, since it directly addresses the question without unnecessary information, its relevance is high. The lack of complete coverage of the ground truth information (especially the detail about sizes over 10) prevents it from being considered fully correct and completely relevant.\n\nTherefore, considering the aspects of coverage and relevance, the generated answer falls short of being completely correct and relevant due to the omission of a significant detail but is still more correct than incorrect.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
