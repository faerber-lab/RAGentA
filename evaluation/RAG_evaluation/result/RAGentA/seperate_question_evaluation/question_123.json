  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the process step by step, considering the aspects of coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks for the start date of diplomatic relations between Nepal and Switzerland.\n\n2. **Ground Truth Answer**: The correct answer, as per the ground truth, is that diplomatic relations between Nepal and Switzerland were established in November 1959.\n\n3. **Generated Answer**: The generated answer states that Nepal and Switzerland established diplomatic relations in 1956.\n\n4. **Coverage Analysis**: The generated answer provides a specific year (1956) as the start date of diplomatic relations. However, this year does not match the year provided in the ground truth (1959). The month (November) mentioned in the ground truth is also not included in the generated answer. Thus, the generated answer lacks complete accuracy in terms of the specific date (year and month) of the establishment of diplomatic relations.\n\n5. **Relevance Analysis**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing a year, which is the type of information requested. There is no unnecessary information included in the answer, making it relevant to the question asked.\n\n6. **Correctness Evaluation**: Given that the generated answer provides an incorrect year (1956 instead of 1959), it is considered incorrect. Despite being relevant and directly addressing the question, the inaccuracy of the information provided makes the answer incorrect.\n\n7. **Final Evaluation**: Considering the aspects of coverage and relevance, the generated answer fails to provide the correct information (coverage) but is directly relevant to the question asked. Since the answer is incorrect due to the wrong year, it falls into the category of an incorrect answer.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: -1.0",
