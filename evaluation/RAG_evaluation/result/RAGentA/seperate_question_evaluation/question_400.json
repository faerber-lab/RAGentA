  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer states that both kimonos and hanboks are not commonly worn as everyday clothing in Japan and Korea. This directly aligns with the ground truth answer, which also states that neither garment is commonly worn as everyday clothing anymore. However, the generated answer lacks the additional details provided in the ground truth about the specific occasions when these garments are worn, such as weddings, funerals, tea ceremonies for kimonos, and formal occasions or special events like weddings and New Year's Day for hanbok. Despite this, the core information regarding their everyday use is correctly conveyed.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question without providing any unnecessary information. It stays focused on the main query about the common usage of kimonos and hanboks as everyday clothing, providing a clear and concise response that aligns with the question's requirements.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in stating that kimonos and hanboks are not commonly worn as everyday clothing. However, it lacks the full context and additional details about when these garments are typically worn, as provided in the ground truth. Since the answer is correct but does not cover all the vital information from the ground truth, and considering it does not contain any irrelevant information, the score should reflect its accuracy and brevity.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
