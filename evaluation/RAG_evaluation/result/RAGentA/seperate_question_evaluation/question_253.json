  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: To make a Habanero Margarita, you will need habanero-infused tequila, Triple Sec, and fresh lime juice.\n   - **Support**: Passage 1 mentions Reata Restaurant's Habanero margarita recipe, which includes habanero-infused tequila, Triple Sec, and implies the use of lime juice (though it's cut off, the context suggests its inclusion). Passage 2 also mentions a Mango Habanero Margarita, supporting the use of habanero in margaritas.\n\n2. **Claim**: The proportions typically used are 1 \u00bc oz. habanero-infused tequila, \u00be oz. Triple Sec, and \u00bd oz. fresh lime juice.\n   - **Support**: Passage 1 directly supports this claim by providing the exact proportions for Reata Restaurant's Habanero margarita recipe.\n\n3. **Claim**: For the habanero-infused tequila, you can infuse seeded sliced habaneros or halved habaneros with seeds into tequila for a kick.\n   - **Support**: Passage 1 supports this by mentioning that you can make habanero tequila by infusing seeded sliced habaneros (or halved habaneros with seeds) into tequila.\n\n4. **Claim**: To enhance the flavor, you can also consider adding a splash of agave nectar or simple syrup for sweetness, depending on your preference.\n   - **Support**: While the passages do not directly mention adding agave nectar or simple syrup to a Habanero Margarita, Passage 3 mentions using agave nectar in a different margarita recipe, implying that it's a common practice to adjust sweetness.\n\n5. **Claim**: Garnish the drink with a slice of habanero pepper for extra spiciness, if desired.\n   - **Support**: Passage 3 supports this claim by suggesting that you can add a bit of spice by garnishing with a slice of habanero pepper.\n\nGiven the analysis, most claims in the answer are directly supported by the passages, especially those related to the ingredients and proportions of a Habanero Margarita. The suggestion to add agave nectar or simple syrup for sweetness, while not directly supported for a Habanero Margarita, is a reasonable inference based on common practices in margarita recipes mentioned in the passages.\n\nTherefore, the answer has strong support from the passages, with all specific claims about the Habanero Margarita recipe being directly supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the key components and compare them to the ground truth.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers the essential ingredients and their proportions as mentioned in the ground truth: 1 \u00bc oz. habanero-infused tequila, \u00be oz. Triple Sec, and \u00bd oz. fresh lime juice. However, it misses mentioning \"sweet and sour mix to fill the glass\" and \"salt for the rim,\" which are part of the ground truth. Despite this, the core ingredients and their proportions are correctly identified.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing the necessary ingredients and their proportions for a Habanero Margarita. However, it also includes additional information that, while potentially useful for someone looking to make the drink, is not directly relevant to the question about ingredients and proportions. This includes the method for infusing tequila with habaneros, suggestions for adding sweetness (agave nectar or simple syrup), and a garnish idea (a slice of habanero pepper). The mention of adjusting proportions to suit taste is also somewhat relevant but not directly answering the question about standard proportions.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in terms of the core ingredients and their proportions but contains additional, somewhat irrelevant information. It does not fully cover all aspects of the ground truth answer (missing sweet and sour mix and salt for the rim) but does provide the main ingredients and their proportions accurately.\n\nTherefore, the generated answer falls into the category of being correct but containing irrelevant information.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
