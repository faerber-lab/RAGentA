  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the comparison between Yale Bulldogs sports team and Tyndale House in terms of their institutional missions as presented in both the ground truth and the generated answer.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers the main points from the ground truth, including the primary focus of Yale Bulldogs on athletic competition as part of Yale University and Tyndale House's focus on biblical research and academic pursuits. However, it introduces additional details not present in the ground truth, such as promoting school spirit, fostering a sense of community, and competing at a high level in various sports for Yale Bulldogs, and the emphasis on making the Bible accessible and promoting Christian values for Tyndale House. Despite these additions, the core distinction between the two institutions' missions is preserved.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by comparing the purposes of Yale Bulldogs and Tyndale House. It does so without diverting into completely unrelated topics but does include some information that, while relevant to understanding the broader context of each institution, is not strictly necessary for a direct comparison of their missions (e.g., specific sports mentioned for Yale Bulldogs, the detail about Tyndale House being a Christian publishing house).\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in its core comparison and directly addresses the question. However, it contains some additional information that, while not irrelevant, expands upon the basic comparison provided in the ground truth. This means the answer is not entirely concise or limited to the information given in the ground truth but does effectively convey the main points of difference between the two institutions' missions.\n\nTherefore, the generated answer falls into the category of being correct but containing some irrelevant or expansive information not strictly necessary for the comparison as outlined in the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
