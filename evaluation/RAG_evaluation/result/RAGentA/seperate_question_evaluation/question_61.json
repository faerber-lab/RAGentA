  "question": "What is the difference in Energy Usage Intensity (EUI) between a recently built commercial office building and a typical pharmaceutical plant?",
  "generated_answer": "The average recently built commercial office building has an EUI of 81.4 kBtu/sq.ft. (257 kWh/m3), while the average pharmaceutical plant has an EUI of 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,819 kWh/m2). This indicates that pharmaceutical plants have an EUI that is approximately 15 times higher than that of recently built commercial office buildings.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "The average recently built (after 2000) commercial office building has an EUI of 81.4kBtu/sq.ft. (257 kWh/m3), while the average pharmaceutical plant has an EUI of 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,819 kWh/m2), which is more than an order of magnitude larger.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down its claims and compare them to the information provided in the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: The average recently built commercial office building has an EUI of 81.4 kBtu/sq.ft. (257 kWh/m3).\n   - **Support**: This claim is directly supported by Passage 1, which states, \"The average recently built (after 2000) commercial office building has an average EUI of 81.4kBtu/sq.ft. (257 kWh/m3).\"\n\n2. **Claim**: The average pharmaceutical plant has an EUI of 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,819 kWh/m2).\n   - **Support**: This claim is also directly supported by Passage 1, which mentions, \"The average pharmaceutical plant has an EUI of 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. (3,819 kWh/m2).\"\n\n3. **Claim**: Pharmaceutical plants have an EUI that is approximately 15 times higher than that of recently built commercial office buildings.\n   - **Support**: To verify this, we calculate the ratio of the EUI of pharmaceutical plants to commercial office buildings: 1,210 kBtu/sq.ft. / 81.4 kBtu/sq.ft. \u2248 14.86. This is very close to 15 times, considering rounding, and thus is supported by the information in Passage 1.\n\nGiven that all claims in the answer are directly supported by the passages, specifically Passage 1, the faithfulness of the answer is fully supported.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 1.0",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer provides the EUI values for both the recently built commercial office building and the pharmaceutical plant, which are identical to those in the ground truth answer. This includes the specific EUI values in both kBtu/sq.ft and kWh/m^3 (or m^2 for the pharmaceutical plant), indicating a high level of coverage of the vital information from the ground truth. The generated answer also calculates the comparative difference in EUI between the two types of buildings, stating that pharmaceutical plants have an EUI approximately 15 times higher than that of commercial office buildings. This calculation is correct based on the provided numbers (1210 kBtu/sq.ft / 81.4 kBtu/sq.ft \u2248 14.86, which can be rounded to approximately 15 times). Therefore, the coverage of vital information is excellent.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing the EUI values for both types of buildings and then interprets these values to answer the question about the difference in EUI. There is no unnecessary or irrelevant information provided in the answer. It stays focused on the question asked and provides a clear, concise comparison based on the data.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is both highly relevant and provides complete coverage of the vital information from the ground truth. It accurately calculates and presents the difference in EUI between the two types of buildings without including any unnecessary information.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 2.0",
