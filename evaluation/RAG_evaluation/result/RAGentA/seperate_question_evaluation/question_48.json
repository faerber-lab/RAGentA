  "question": "How is hunting access affected by the CAP canal near the Picacho Mountains?",
  "generated_answer": "Hunting access near the Picacho Mountains is somewhat restricted due to the C.A.P. canal. Hunters can gain access from the east on Deep Well Ranch Road, from the west by Houser Road from Highway 87, and from the south on Pecan Road. However, the C.A.P. canal along the west and south side of Newman Peak limits access. Additionally, the railroad crossing is blocked about 3 miles north of the Picacho Dairy Queen along the I-10 frontage road, further affecting access.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "Access is somewhat restricted by the C.A.P. canal along the west and south side of Newman Peak. However, hunters are allowed to walk through the culverts and over the bridge crossings to hunt the east and north sides of the CAP canal.",

  "faithfulness_evaluation": "To evaluate the faithfulness of the answer, let's break down each claim and check if it's supported by the passages.\n\n1. **Claim**: Hunting access near the Picacho Mountains is somewhat restricted due to the C.A.P. canal.\n   - **Support**: Passage 3 mentions that \"Access may be somewhat restricted due to the C.A.P. canal\" near the Picacho Mountains, which directly supports this claim.\n\n2. **Claim**: Hunters can gain access from the east on Deep Well Ranch Road, from the west by Houser Road from Highway 87, and from the south on Pecan Road.\n   - **Support**: Passage 3 and Passage 2 both mention that access to the Picacho Mountains can be gained from Deep Well Ranch Road, Houser Road, and Pecan Road, supporting this claim.\n\n3. **Claim**: The C.A.P. canal along the west and south side of Newman Peak limits access.\n   - **Support**: Passage 2 specifically states that \"Access is somewhat restricted by the C.A.P. canal along the west and south side of Newman Peak,\" directly supporting this claim.\n\n4. **Claim**: The railroad crossing is blocked about 3 miles north of the Picacho Dairy Queen along the I-10 frontage road, further affecting access.\n   - **Support**: Passage 2 mentions that \"The railroad crossing is blocked by railroad construction along the I-10 frontage road two miles north of the Picacho Dairy Queen,\" which is very similar but not exactly the same as the claim. The difference in distance (3 miles vs. 2 miles) introduces a slight discrepancy.\n\nGiven the analysis, all claims in the answer are supported by the passages with one minor discrepancy regarding the exact distance to the blocked railroad crossing. This discrepancy is minor and does not significantly impact the overall faithfulness of the answer to the information provided in the passages.\n\nFINAL_FAITHFULNESS_SCORE: 0.9",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the analysis into the aspects of coverage and relevance as requested.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer mentions that hunting access near the Picacho Mountains is somewhat restricted due to the C.A.P. canal, which aligns with the ground truth answer. It also specifies that the C.A.P. canal along the west and south side of Newman Peak limits access, which is directly mentioned in the ground truth. However, the ground truth provides a crucial piece of information that the generated answer does not: hunters are allowed to walk through the culverts and over the bridge crossings to hunt the east and north sides of the CAP canal. This omission means the generated answer does not fully cover the vital information from the ground truth, particularly regarding how hunters can still access restricted areas.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by stating how the C.A.P. canal affects hunting access near the Picacho Mountains. However, it also includes additional information about access points (Deep Well Ranch Road, Houser Road, and Pecan Road) and a blocked railroad crossing, which, while potentially useful for hunters, is not directly relevant to how the CAP canal affects access. The question specifically asks about the impact of the CAP canal, not about all possible access points or obstacles in the area.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in stating that access is restricted due to the C.A.P. canal but fails to provide complete information on how hunters can navigate these restrictions as per the ground truth. Additionally, it includes information that, while related to hunting access in the broader area, is not directly relevant to the question about the CAP canal's impact.\n\nTherefore, the generated answer is partially correct and relevant but contains unnecessary information and lacks a crucial detail from the ground truth.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
