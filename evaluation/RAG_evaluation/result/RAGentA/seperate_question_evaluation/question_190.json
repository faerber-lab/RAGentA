  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break it down step by step considering the aspects of coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers several vital points from the ground truth, such as the importance of educating oneself about bipolar disorder, providing emotional support, encouraging professional treatment, and being prepared for crisis situations. It also emphasizes the need for empathy, patience, and maintaining open communication, which are crucial for supporting someone with bipolar disorder. However, it does not explicitly mention avoiding drug and alcohol abuse or the specific action of contacting mental health professionals or calling 911 in emergencies, which are mentioned in the ground truth.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer is directly addressing the question of how to help a friend with bipolar disorder. It provides a comprehensive approach to supporting someone with the condition, focusing on emotional support, encouragement of professional help, and self-education. The information provided is relevant and useful for someone looking to support a friend with bipolar disorder. There is no unnecessary or irrelevant information that detracts from the main question being asked.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is largely correct and relevant. It covers a significant portion of the vital information from the ground truth and directly addresses the question without including unnecessary information. However, it does lack a couple of specific points mentioned in the ground truth, such as the importance of avoiding drug and alcohol abuse and the explicit mention of emergency contact procedures.\n\nSince the generated answer is correct but contains a minor omission of specific details from the ground truth, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 2 (Correct and completely relevant). However, it is far more accurate and relevant than a score of 0 or -1 would suggest. Therefore, the most appropriate score, considering the continuous scale provided, would be slightly below 2, reflecting its high relevance and coverage but acknowledging the minor omissions.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.8",
