  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the comparison with the ground truth answer based on the aspects of coverage and relevance.\n\n1. **Coverage**: The ground truth answer specifies that \"BDA Engineers was the structural engineer for the Social Condenser project in Superior, Arizona.\" The key pieces of information here are the name of the structural engineer (BDA Engineers), the project name (Social Condenser), and the location (Superior, Arizona). The generated answer states, \"The structural engineer for the Social Condenser project in Arizona was BDA Engineers.\" It correctly identifies the structural engineer (BDA Engineers) and the project (Social Condenser) but lacks the specific city (Superior) within Arizona. Thus, the generated answer covers most of the vital information but misses a detail about the location.\n\n2. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question by providing the name of the structural engineer and the project, which are the core elements requested. However, it does not include the city \"Superior,\" which could be considered relevant for pinpointing the exact location of the project within Arizona. Despite this omission, the answer does not contain unnecessary information; it is concise and directly related to the question asked.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is largely correct but lacks a specific detail (the city of Superior) that is present in the ground truth. This omission affects its completeness but not its direct relevance to the question asked. Therefore, the generated answer is correct but contains slightly less relevant information than the ground truth, primarily due to the omission of the city name.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
