  "ground_truth_answer": "For winter camping shelters, you can choose locations with emergency shelters like Mount Seymour's group campsite or Lone Duck campground, which provide wood stoves and protection. Alternative options include using tarps in lean-to fashion to contain heat from fire, or A-frame setups over snow-dug seating areas. Some campers use rooftop tents with annex rooms and insulation layers. For protection from dangerous cold temperatures, officials recommend minimizing outdoor activities, wearing several layers of loose-fitting, water-repellent clothing, using proper head covering, mittens, and waterproof boots. It's also crucial to ensure sufficient heating fuel and proper ventilation when using alternative heating sources to prevent carbon monoxide buildup.",

  "correctness_evaluation": "To evaluate the correctness of the generated answer, let's break down the key components of the ground truth answer and compare them with the generated answer.\n\n1. **Shelter Options**: The ground truth mentions specific shelter options such as emergency shelters with wood stoves, using tarps in lean-to fashion, A-frame setups, and rooftop tents with annex rooms and insulation layers. In contrast, the generated answer focuses on a 4-season tent, insulated flooring, and the use of a portable wood-burning stove inside the tent. While these are relevant shelter options for winter camping, the generated answer lacks the diversity of options presented in the ground truth.\n\n2. **Protection from Cold Temperatures**: The ground truth emphasizes minimizing outdoor activities, wearing several layers of loose-fitting, water-repellent clothing, using proper head covering, mittens, and waterproof boots, and ensuring sufficient heating fuel and proper ventilation. The generated answer also covers dressing in warm, layered clothing and wearing waterproof boots, which aligns with the ground truth. However, it introduces additional heat sources like heated socks and hand warmers, which, while useful, are not mentioned in the ground truth. The generated answer also discusses providing shelter and heated beds for pets, which is not relevant to the question about human shelter options and protection from cold temperatures.\n\n3. **Coverage**: The generated answer covers some vital information from the ground truth, such as the importance of appropriate shelter and clothing for winter camping. However, it misses specific details about various shelter types and the critical aspect of ventilation when using heating sources.\n\n4. **Relevance**: The generated answer directly addresses the question about shelter options for winter camping and protection from cold temperatures but includes unnecessary information about pets. This irrelevant information detracts from the answer's overall relevance.\n\nGiven these considerations, the generated answer is correct in the sense that it provides useful information for winter camping and protection from cold temperatures. However, it lacks the breadth of shelter options discussed in the ground truth and includes information not directly relevant to the question asked.\n\nFINAL_CORRECTNESS_SCORE: 1.0",
