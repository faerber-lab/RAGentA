  "question": "What's the difference between HIPAA and PIPEDA in terms of who they protect?",
  "generated_answer": "HIPAA primarily protects individuals' health information in the United States, applying to covered entities such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and healthcare providers. It ensures the privacy and security of protected health information (PHI) and grants patients rights regarding their health data. PIPEDA, on the other hand, is a Canadian federal law that applies to private-sector organizations and protects all personal information, not just health data, during commercial activities. It sets out rules for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information, ensuring it is handled responsibly and with consent. In summary, HIPAA focuses on health information privacy in the U.S., while PIPEDA covers broader personal information protection in Canada.",
  "ground_truth_answer": "HIPAA and PIPEDA differ in their scope of protection. HIPAA specifically focuses on protecting health care information and applies to healthcare providers and their business partners who handle electronic health transactions, payments, and patient records. PIPEDA, on the other hand, has a broader scope as it governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal information during normal commercial activities across all types of organizations, including businesses, not-for-profit organizations, and the health care industry.",
