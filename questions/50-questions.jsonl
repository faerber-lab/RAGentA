{"question":"What are the medical uses of Tramadol, and what are the signs of its abuse?","answer":"Tramadol is a pain reliever used for treating moderate to severe pain, with an extended-release version for chronic pain requiring 24-hour maintenance. It works by binding to opioid receptors in the brain, similar to morphine, and has been found to help reduce pain and stiffness while improving function in osteoarthritis patients when taken for up to 3 months. As for signs of abuse, they include taking the drug without a prescription, steadily increasing dosage, continuing use after prescription ends, or using it with other habit-forming substances. Common side effects of abuse include vomiting coupled with nausea, pinpoint pupils, and changes in appetite. Severe abuse can lead to seizures, particularly when doses exceed 400mg per day.","context":["Tramadol, also offered under brand Ultram and Ultram ER, is a numbing pain reliever used in the therapy of modest to extreme discomfort. The extended-release (EMERGENCY ROOM) version is utilized to deal with chronic pain that requires 24-hour upkeep. On top of that, there may be other uses for this drug.\nPrior to taking Tramadol, it is essential to discuss with your doctor whether you have actually ever before been addicted to drugs or alcohol. This is very important since Tramadol must not be taken when one is intoxicated or by those that have recently used drugs such as alcohol, other narcotic pain medicines, medicine for the treatment of depression or anxiety, tranquilizers such as Valium, medicine for the treatment of mental disorder such as schizophrenia, or road medications.\nAdditionally, although the threat of seizure is present for all users of Tramadol, this risk might be substantially greater in those that have particular clinical conditions. For that reason, it is necessary that you inform your physician if you deal with any one of the following problems: a history of drug abuse, epilepsy or seizure problem, previous head injury, or a metabolic problem.\nOther problems that may make Tramadol contraindicated include kidney illness, liver disease, any type of problem of the tummy, or a history of clinical depression or mental disorder.\nIf you are expectant and considering taking Tramadol, it is important to recognize that the drug remains in maternity group C. This indicates that the drug might be unsafe to a coming infant, and also it may also trigger severe – or even fatal – negative effects in a newborn if it is carried out to the mommy while pregnant or labor. Note, as well, that Tramadol can enter a mother’s breast milk and can consequently be hazardous to a nursing baby.\nAge is a consider an individual’s viability tramadol tablets for sale for Tramadol, also. It must not be given to anyone under 16 years of age, and also for those over 65 a lower-than-usual dosage might be recommended. Lastly, take Tramadol specifically as it has been suggested. Take it with a full glass of water and do not squash the tablet computer. You may take it with or without food, yet whichever method you select, make certain to take it similarly every single time.\nramadol is a common version of Ultram which is a synthetic analgesic drug. Although the exact process by which tramadol works is not known, it is believed to function equally as morphine does. This entails binding the opioid receptors in the mind. These receptors are in charge of the transmission of discomfort sensations throughout the body.\nTramadol is prescribed by doctors for objectives of dealing with moderate to reasonably severe discomfort. It belongs to a course of medicines called opiate agonists and also works by modifying how the body detects pain. When taken for up to 3 months, this medication has actually been found to aid to minimize pain and also rigidity, while enhancing function as well as on the whole well being of individuals suffering from osteoarthritis. Although frequently misinterpreted for an NSAID or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, tramadol is not any of the above.\nTramadol might be suggested in a 50mg dose as an immediate release tablet computer, or in a 100, 200 or 300 mg dosage in an extensive release table. The last is typically prescribed to clients experiencing chronic discomfort who are in need of continuous therapy in the long-term. Tramadol needs to be taken correctly while adhering to the prescription instructions so regarding avoid serious side effects or perhaps fatality. For instance, the extensive release tablet computers should be taken entire, as well as not eaten, split or squashed.\nAvoid taking tramadol when expecting as the secure use of this medication by pregnant or breastfeeding mothers has actually not yet been established. Prevent taking more tramadol than your prescription offers as this could bring about dependency. You need to likewise not stop taking tramadol without prior appointment with your physician as this could bring about withdrawal symptoms. Many physicians recommend gradually reducing your dosage over time.\nIf you are already taking other medications, make certain to inform your medical professional prior to he begins you on tramadol. This is since medicine interactions are possible with tramadol consisting of reduced results by Carbamazepine, enhanced focus of 50-60% by Quinidine, and seizures or other major negative effects as a result of MAO or SSRI preventions. Your central nerves and also respiratory system anxiety might be raised when tramadol is integrated with specific substances such as controlled substances, alcohol, sedatives, anesthetics and also depressants.\nAlthough tramadol is normally well endured, it does result in certain temporary side effects such as irregular bowel movements, nausea, headaches, dizziness, vomiting and also sleepiness. Various other much less usual side effects consist of sweating, itching, completely dry mouth, breakout, diarrhea and vertigo along with unusual instances of seizures. Symptoms of an overdose of tramadol consist of trouble in breathing or continuing to be awake, decreased pupil size, seizure, coma, cardiovascular disease or loss of consciousness.","Tramadol Use and Abuse\nTramadol Use and Abuse\nWhat is Tramadol?\nTramadol is an opioid pain reliever (OPR) that belongs to the same family as fentanyl and oxycodone. Tramadol, however, ranks far lower in strength than fentanyl or oxycodone. Apart from reducing pain, it is also known as a mood enhancer. This medication works best in cases where the patient is suffering from moderate to severe pain. It is also considered for use in people who are recuperating after surgery.\nTramadol is categorized as a Schedule IV drug because of a lower threat perception for inducing abuse in users. People commonly underestimate its addictive properties because it is weaker than other opioid medications. Since it is an opioid, however, the danger of addiction is still present and looms large on regular users of the drug.\nIs Tramadol Dangerous?\nTramadol usage is always accompanied by the possible threat of adverse reactions, even when used with caution and under medical supervision. While typical reactions of its usage range from nausea to dizziness, its abuse can lead to more intense reactions. The medications usage, in combination with other habit-forming substances, can sometimes lead to fatal consequences.\nPeople suffering from addiction or misusing the medication usually procure tramadol illegally from the unregulated markets and street vendors. Some common street names of the drug include Chill Pills, Trammies, and Ultras (a take on the generic brand).\nSince Tramadol is among the least potent of opioid painkillers, there is a common misconception that it does not lead to addiction. It is precisely this misinformation that has led many people on the path to addiction and substance abuse.\nIf a person is using this drug without obtaining a prescription, this is considered tramadol abuse. Similarly, those who are steadily increasing their dosage or continue to use it even after they are no longer prescribed it are also signs of a substance addiction. The same notion applies when using it in combination with other habit-forming drugs or substances.\nThat’s why identifying the signs of abuse at the earliest stage is essential to prevent the onset of addiction.\nThe Scope of Tramadol Abuse in America\nIn 2017, 47,600 people in the United States died from drug overdoses involving opioids.1\nIn 2017, 43,036 people in the United States died from unintentional drug overdoses involving opioids.2\nA total of 2,586 people died of drug overdoses of undetermined intent involving opioids.3\nIn 2016, an estimated 91,840 hospitalizations occurred for opioid-related poisonings in the United States.4\nPrescriptions for Tramadol increased 88 percent from 23.3 million in 2008 to 43.8 million in 2013.5\nIn 2011, Tramadol was ranked ninth in the list of narcotic pain relievers secured in law enforcement operations and analyzed by federal, state, and local forensic laboratories.6\nMore than 399,000 people died from overdoses involving any opioid, including prescription and illicit opioids from 1999-2017.7\nUnfortunately, and ironically, many people who faithfully follow their physicians’ prescriptions are at risk of suffering addiction.\nFrequent and prolonged usage of this drug has been known to lead to drug tolerance in many people. As a result, people must take larger and larger dosages to experience the drug’s effects. In addition to developing tolerance, Tramadol users can expect to suffer from withdrawal symptoms when use suddenly stops. Typically, withdrawal is known to cause symptoms such as irritability, depression, and flu-like symptoms.\nIf a person exhibits tolerance to the drug and also suffers from withdrawal symptoms when they stop using, they are most likely struggling with Tramadol dependence and addiction. Some of the telltale signs of substance addiction are frequent cravings, uninhibited use, and relationship problems that stem from drug use.\nDoctors usually prescribe Tramadol because of its relatively lower potential to cause addiction as compared to many of the other opioid painkillers. This point is also underlined by the fact that it is classified as a schedule IV substance, while the majority of opioid painkillers are listed under schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.\nMore often than not, the feeling of calmness and euphoria that this drug generates in users is the main reason for its abuse. Those who abuse it usually do so in an attempt to feel unnaturally relaxed and carefree. People suffering from severe pain are also likely to take higher doses of the drug, thus exposing them to greater threats of dangerous side effects that could include seizures and respiratory depression.\nTramadol is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant and thus tends to effect lung and heart function negatively. Those who take very large doses of this drug (much higher than what would be prescribed) might stop breathing altogether and may experience a fatal overdose.\nSide Effects of Tramadol Abuse\nSome of the typical signs and side effects of Tramadol abuse are:\nVomiting coupled with nausea\nPinpoint pupils (pupils are very small)\nChanges in appetite\nTramadol abuse can potentially result in negative reactions of extreme nature, such as seizures. Seizures usually occur when larger dosages are consumed (averaging 400 mg or more per day), over extended time frames. Seizures also manifest more often when this medication and antidepressants are taken together.\nOverdose and Withdrawal\nSome of the symptoms associated with Tramadol overdose are:\nAbnormally low blood pressure\nSlow heart rate\nSweaty or clammy skin\nTramadol Withdrawal Symptoms\nOne of the problems linked to extended usage or high doses of Tramadol use is the possibility of suffering from withdrawal symptoms. When a person with tramadol dependence stops taking it, the body struggles to perform normally. As a result, the very effects that the drug was prescribed to heal might reappear.\nPsychological Symptoms of Tramadol Withdrawal include:\nPhysical symptoms of Tramadol Withdrawal include:\nEarly and Late Withdrawal Symptoms\nOpioid withdrawal is characterized by two main phases: early and late withdrawal. The early withdrawal phase starts when the drug leaves the bloodstream while the late withdrawal phase happens sometime later. Depending upon factors such as intensity and duration of addiction or substance abuse, opioid withdrawal symptoms vary according to the phase in which the patient is currently passing through.\nEarly Opioid Withdrawal Symptoms Include:\nLate Opioid Withdrawal Symptoms Include:\nThe onset of opioid withdrawal symptoms typically begins within about 12 hours of taking the last dose. According to figures released by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), approximately 90% of people experience traditional withdrawal symptoms when stopping use. The remaining 10% might experience symptoms such as severe confusion, extreme paranoia, panic attacks, anxiety, hallucinations, and even tingling or numbness in their extremities.\nWhen people experience intense drug cravings, it is usually an indication that a detox or rehabilitation center would be beneficial as a first point of treatment. Tramadol detox gives the body a chance to regain its original healthy condition without suffering the discomforts associated with the withdrawal symptoms. Rehabilitation equips people with the strategies required to tackle chemical cravings and triggers that encourage the use of drugs.\nWhen administered under medical supervision in a safe and conducive environment, there are significantly higher chances of the patient successfully completing addiction therapy than without formal treatment.\n- Scholl L, Seth P, Kariisa M, Wilson N, Baldwin G.

{"question":"How do low-frequency sounds from car stereos compare to construction equipment vibrations in terms of their effects on buildings and people?","answer":"Low-frequency sounds from car stereos can cause vibrations that make glass and ceramics rattle, creating annoyance for people. In comparison, construction equipment like small dozers (0.008 IPS), jackhammers (0.07 IPS), and large dozers (0.2 IPS) produce vibrations that are noticeable to humans but typically well below the damage threshold for buildings, except for vibratory pile drivers which can reach 1.5 IPS.","context":["This guide addresses the problem of loud car stereos, one of the most common sources of noise complaints in many jurisdictions.† The guide begins by describing the problem and reviewing factors that contribute to it. It then identifies a series of questions that might assist you in analyzing your local problem. Finally, it reviews responses to the problem and what is known about these from evaluative research and police practice. Throughout this guide, the term loud car stereos is used as a shorthand way of saying car stereos that are played loudly. The problem is attributable mainly to the use of special stereo equipment capable of producing extremely loud sound, rather than factory-installed stereo equipment.\n† Sound, noise and annoyance are not the same thing. Sound is merely a physical property entailing sound waves. Noise is unwanted sound. Annoyance is the negative feeling one gets from being exposed to noise. Sound can be measured in terms of its pressure, frequency, variation, character, and quality. Annoyance is a subjective measure.\nMost jurisdictions have some form of noise law that regulates loud car stereos. Police are concerned about loud car stereos for two main reasons: 1) they annoy some people, and 2) they inhibit drivers' ability to hear emergency signals on the road. This guide focuses on the annoyance aspect of loud car stereos, rather than the safety aspect, because there is not much published research and practice related to the latter.††\n†† Police in Prince William County, Va., demonstrated through controlled tests that loud car stereos impair drivers' ability to hear emergency vehicle sirens, and concluded this is a serious aspect of the problem (Smith 2000).\nLoud car stereos can also make another noise problem worse: they can activate some car alarms. In some jurisdictions, drug dealers advertise by cruising neighborhoods with the car stereo turned up loud. In most jurisdictions, the problem of loud car stereos falls to the police to address, primarily because enforcement carries the risk of violent confrontation.†††\n††† At least in the United States, noise control has become almost exclusively a matter for local authorities since the federal government drastically cut back funding for noise control in the early 1980s (Sickler-Hart 1997[Full text]; Lief 1994; Schultz 1999; Sedgwick 1991[Full text]).\nThe problem of loud car stereos is more widespread than a simple tally of complaints would reveal. Perhaps only 5 to 10 percent of people bothered by any type of noise will file an official complaint, because other factors influence people.1 Many citizens are not aware of their legal right to quiet and do not know where they can register a complaint.\nConsequently, the volume of official complaints about loud car stereos might indicate the existence of a problem, but not necessarily how intense or widespread it is.\nUnderstanding the factors that contribute to your problem will help you frame your own local analysis questions, determine good effectiveness measures, recognize key intervention points, and select appropriate responses.\nHighly amplified car stereos emit a lot of low-frequency sounds through the systems' woofer speakers. Low-frequency noise is usually found to be more annoying than highfrequency noise at similar volume.2 The vibrations caused by the low-frequency sound waves can often be felt in addition to being heard. They cause glass and ceramics to rattle, compounding the annoyance.3\nBoom car's trunk speakers\nPlaying car stereos loudly can be an act of social defiance by some, or merely inconsiderate behavior by others. For yet others, it is a passionate hobby, an important part of their cultural identity and lifestyle. Judging by the sales marketing of car stereo manufacturers and dealers, the interest in car stereo competitions† and the sums of money spent on car stereos, police are confronting a popular and lucrative phenomenon. It is not easy to change the behavior of those who see loud car stereos as an important part of their lifestyle.\n† In car stereo competitions, usually sponsored by car stereo manufacturers or distributors, participants receive prizes for the loudest car stereos.\nOverexposure to noise is now understood to have a number of negative health and behavioral effects.4 Loud car stereos most obviously affect the car occupants' hearing. Noise from a variety of sources, including loud car stereos, can cause hearing loss, disturb sleep, increase stress, make people irritable, and make naturally aggressive people more aggressive. It can make people less likely to help others, and less likely to sit outdoors or participate in social activities. It can compel people to move out of neighborhoods they otherwise like, and thereby depress property values. Some people, such as schoolchildren, hospital patients and the mentally ill, are especially harmed by exposure to loud noise (although loud car stereos may not be a major noise source for these subpopulations).5\nHow annoyed people get about noise depends on a number of factors,6 including the following:\nAct of defiance\nApplying these factors to loud car stereos, you can see how the same sound can affect people quite differently: some will enjoy it,† while others will hate it.\n† Extremely loud music may actually increase adrenaline in some listeners or cause fluids in the ear to shift, either of which can create a pleasurable dizziness and euphoric feeling (Sedgwick 1991[Full text]; Cooke and McCampbell 1992). Obviously, complainants experience no such pleasure.\nPeople respond to noise in various ways. Some people complain to authorities, some take steps to insulate themselves, some adapt to the noise, and some move away from the noise. Those who complain greatly appreciate effective responses from authorities; no response or ineffective responses are often harshly criticized.8\nPolice are also frequently called upon to address other sources of noise, each calling for its own analysis and responses.

Movement through the earth is generated vertically as well as horizontally. As the waves travel away from the source, they encounter an increasingly large amount of material, which causes the energy in the wave to dissipate. Therefore, the larger the distance between the source of the vibration and the object detecting the vibration, the weaker the effect.\nThe human body is an excellent detector of vibration, but a poor measuring device. Most investigators have determined that the best way to measure the magnitude of vibration and the effect on human and building response is using peak particle velocity (PPV). PPV is measured in inches per second (IPS), with a larger value representing a bigger vibration. Some average measurements for daily activities in a house are: walking – 0.29 IPS, nail hammering – 0.55 IPS, door slamming – 0.59 IPS, and jumping – 2.19 IPS. Research shows that the human body can notice PPV as little as 0.02 IPS, which is far below the activities previously mentioned.\nHouses that are poorly maintained, or with brittle plaster walls, can experience aesthetic damage once the PPV approaches 1.0 IPS. Sound residential structures have a damage threshold value of 2.0 IPS, and commercial structures are at 4.0 IPS. These values show that there is quite a big difference between the size at which the human body begins to notice a vibration and the size of a vibration that will cause damage to a building.\nMost construction sites that involve the use of explosives are required to do pre-blast surveys to map the existing cracks or other defects in buildings within a certain radius from the blasting activity and to measure the vibrations produced during construction. If the vibrations from the blasting exceed the threshold level and damage is reported by the homeowner or business owner, the contractor can determine what damage existed prior to the blast so a comparison can be made, and any damage caused by the construction can be repaired. Cracks caused by construction vibration, whether from blasting or from large equipment, look very similar to typical settlement cracks or cracks caused by moisture and thermal changes in the structure. Therefore, it is important to know which cracks existed prior to the construction activity.\nConstruction sites that do not involve blasting typically do not perform preconstruction surveys of the adjacent buildings to map wall cracks and other pre-existing conditions because the likelihood of damage is very small. Devices to measure the vibrations produced by the construction equipment are also not typically used. Claims against a contractor typically occur when vibrations are felt by a home or business owner and they notice cracks in the interior walls, veneer, or foundation of the structure. Vibrations produced from typical construction machinery located approximately 15 feet from the structure are measured at the following PPVs: a small dozer – 0.008 IPS, jack hammer- 0.07 IPS, a large dozer – 0.2 IPS, and a vibratory pile driver – 1.5 IPS. All of these activities except for the pile driver are well below the damage threshold for all structures; however, the vibrations produced by the machines will be noticed by the human body.\nWhile the noise and the vibrations produced by nearby construction activity may be discomforting and disruptive to daily activities, rarely are the vibrations damaging to structures. Contractors should be aware of historical buildings or dwellings that are in disrepair when performing activities in proximity to these structures. If heavy machinery is going to be operated around these structures, consideration should be given to performing a preconstruction survey of the structures to document pre-existing conditions that later may be confused as damage caused by the construction.\n Construction Vibrations: State of the Art, John F.

{"question":"What are the user interface optimization strategies for VR experiences, and how do they relate to motion sickness prevention?","answer":"User interface optimization strategies for VR include using heavier font weights, enlarging menus and buttons for better visibility, implementing careful visual hierarchy, and using leading lines to direct user attention with minimal head movement. For motion sickness prevention, developers should maintain display frequencies above 60 frames per second, limit the lag between head movements and image display to under 20 milliseconds, avoid sudden acceleration movements, and provide fixed reference points like dashboards in simulation applications. Additionally, limiting the amount of on-screen information and avoiding bright white environments helps reduce visual fatigue and disorientation.","context":["VR design principles\nUseful user interface tips\nDesigning for digital applications is generally shaped by a series of core design principles, such as aligning your objects and limiting the number of fonts used, for example. But with virtual reality games and experiences, it’s slightly different. Designing for 3D digital worlds requires a different approach to 2D – not only in terms of style but in ideas too..\nThe finer details\nScreens on VR devices require lenses that allow the user to see the whole screen when it’s so close to your face but these lenses heavily distort the image shown of the screen – meaning design elements can look jagged and pixelated and detail such as fine lines and delicate patterns struggle to render. Therefore antialiasing is critical, especially for pre-rendered 360 experiences, and it’s important to take care with typography – go for something a weight higher than usual and avoid the fine, small fonts. As for menus, buttons and graphics etc, it’s best to go a tad bigger. When your design translates in the 3D world, they will be much clearer and easier to see.\nLess is more\nJust because you have a 360 sphere, it doesn’t mean you have to use all of it. Consider your visual hierarchy – what will be in your peripheral vision? What’s a comfortable head movement? You don’t want to give your users neck-ache from twisting this way and that to see graphics or copy. Make it easy for users to absorb information or visuals by directing them with leading lines and simple, smaller movements.\nKeep it grounded\nInfinite space looks good but in VR it can make you feel a bit like you’re floating, which can be disorientating to a user. We always add a hint of a gradient in the world space so when you look or move around, you feel grounded. The slight gradient helps enhance the 3D feeling, and therefore the feeling of reality. Also – try to avoid using bright white environments as these can be visually fatiguing to the user.\nLike all design projects – have fun. It’s exciting to play around with what’s possible when your canvas is 3D and it’s always beneficial to experiment within the actual world space. We tend to mock up initial ideas in Photoshop and then play with them in Unity – working closely with the developers to nail down what not only looks best, but what works best too.\nThink outside the box\nSo far, these tips apply for pretty much all VR headsets, but it’s worth considering what type of hardware will be used for what type of experience. For instance, are you creating an interactive experience or a linear one? If it’s the latter, is it necessary for a user to be in the headset from the word go, or can they set up using a 2D screen and then sit back and enjoy the experience? Some of our VR installations and mobile apps start the user journey before the headset goes on to make it more straightforward. On the other hand, more interactive experiences require considerate design so the user can interact with them easily and intuitively. Compared to traditional 2D media, designing for VR and 360 can be a challenge – you have to strike the right balance between eye-catching and contemporary design, with clarity of use and visual quality. What’s more, user testing for all abilities is key. It can be easy to assume your audience knows more about technology than they do, so testing how easy your user interface is to use is vital. Then, when done well, your 3D world space will always have a big impact on the user – transporting them literally from one world to another.","Virtual reality offers experiences that are often rich in emotions. However, some users suffer from side effects that can be annoying to the point of totally ruining the experience. An update on these inconveniences that are often linked to motion sickness.\nCybersickness: the side effects of virtual reality\nMany users reported suffering from dry eyes or headaches, but most often nausea. These symptoms, now known as “Virtual reality sickness” or “Cybersickness,” are similar to those experienced by some people in transport.\nAccording to a study conducted by video game publisher Ubisoft, 45% of users acknowledged some discomfort during the experiment, and 6% admitted to having been particularly affected by these symptoms.\nThe reasons for nausea are known\nFor doctors, nausea experienced by some users has well-known origins. It is the same principle as kinetosis (motion sickness). Doctors explain that the brain can feel inconsistencies during a virtual reality experiment and its reaction is to cause nausea to indicate that something is wrong.\nMovement headset virtual reality nausea motion sickness\nIndeed, the visual information he receives does not correspond to the data coming from the balance. The brain sees that the body is moving or accelerating but does not feel this information from the inner ear, which is responsible for sending information about the body’s balance and movements. Also, there is often a slight discrepancy between the movements of the head and the images, disturbing the brain. Low resolution or low image display frequency can also contribute to these unpleasant symptoms.\nRecommendations of the experts\nExperts who have studied cybersickness have pointed out some areas for improvement. First, the equipment. The headset and the associated computer or smartphone must limit the time lag between the display of images and head movements. Scientists believe that latency of 20 milliseconds should be the maximum tolerable. They also recommend a display frequency of 60 frames per second or more.\nOn the software side, experts advise application developers to avoid sudden or erratic acceleration movements. Scientists have also realized that the amount of information on the screen is essential. Indeed, the more elements of the decor likely to attract the eye of the user, the more he does not know where to look, making him more sensitive to nausea. Giving the player fixed landmarks is also essential. For example, experts recommend leaving a dashboard exposed in a piloting simulation application.\nThe difficult case of lack of movement and acceleration\nAlthough the recommendations made above by the scientists partially correct some of the factors that can trigger nausea, the lack of correlation between the movements and accelerations visualized and those felt by the inner ear is not affected.\nFor this particular point, the most obvious solution is to use an armchair that reproduces the movements and accelerations reproduced on the screen. This technology exists and has even been used for years in some amusement parks. However, it is extremely costly and difficult to implement. However, researchers are working on another technology, simpler and cheaper, which uses a headset that sends electrical signals to the inner ear artificially reproducing movement and acceleration information. This technology is not yet fully developed."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6e687249-1326-4070-ba8e-66757c74dcc4>","<urn:uuid:1461d947-2ad5-48ba-8721-dfc7abde85d0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did Diaghilev's Ballets Russes influence modern dance institutions and what was his approach to shoe craftsmanship?","answer":"Diaghilev's influence on dance institutions was far-reaching, as his company's disciples went on to shape major ballet companies across America. Fokine, Massine, and Nijinska became early choreographers for the American Ballet Theater, while Balanchine established the School of American Ballet and New York City Ballet. Regarding shoe craftsmanship, Diaghilev understood the crucial importance of proper footwear in ballet, where different roles required specific shoe characteristics - from soft shoes for ethereal performances like 'Giselle' to firmer pairs for bravura pieces like 'Don Quixote' and 'Swan Lake'.","context":["Acclaimed art patron, Sergei Diaghilev who set up the widely influential touring ballet company, Ballets Russes in\nParis, is also credited with inspiring young Eastern Europeans to devote themselves to the craft. And it is exactly\nthe layers of artistic, technical and precise craft that correlate with high-end artisanal shoemaking. The symmetry\nstretches further with the dancer’s relationship with a shoe – one that can make or break a performance. Ballet\ndancers are well-renowned to manipulate shoes before entering the stage. Each role can require a different type of\nshoe. In a New York Times article by Tobi Tobias, American ballet dancer Eleanor D'Antuono talks about the\nneed for different shoe characteristics. She explains that: “To sustain the ethereal quality of “Giselle”, the\nsoftest shoes are used to keep the footwork light and noiseless. But for the bravura “Don Quixote” pas de deux, or\nOdile's flashing feats in the third act of “Swan Lake”, the buttress of a considerably firmer pair is needed”.

He overcame initial rejection at the\nRoyal Ballet School to become the first British-born black dancer to perform for the prestigious ballet company.\nAlso known for his attempts at a pirouette, but more seriously his admiration for bespoke shoemaking, The\nRake’s Editor-in-Chief Tom Chamberlin discovered during a collaboration with G.J. Cleverley that bespoke\nshoemaking really isn’t for the faint of heart. And like successful ballet performers, he discovered that the\njourney is totally worth it – as the result is an artistic masterpiece that future generations can benefit\nComparable to a couture showpiece, using the lobster dress produced in collaboration between Schiaparelli and\nSalvador Dalí as illustration, the appreciation of the artistry attached to sui generis shoes doesn’t stop at\npurchase. In 2017 – a pair of ballet shoes worn by the legendary dancer and choreographer Mikhail Baryshnikov sold\nat the charity auction “Art for Life” for one million roubles.\nShoes in many ways are the pivot that allows expression across a wide array of recreations and artistic disciplines.\nThey have acted as the fulcrum for some of the most memorable actions in showbiz history. Most people on this earth\nat some stage will have tried to imitate Michael Jackson’s famous moonwalk, performed in a pair of black leather\nloafers. In slightly more sartorial environs, the influence that Fred Astaire’s style and entertainment mastery had\non other males during the Great Depression cannot be underestimated. Whether it be dancing with Ginger Rogers, Rita\nHayworth or on his own, his impeccable choice of footwear always stood out. The very best handmade two-tone\nspectator shoes or Oxfords in either white or buckskin or brown suede, were favoured by Astaire. Sporting those\nelegant shoes, ballet legend George Balanchine once called him “the greatest dancer in the world.” And upon meeting\nhim, the celebrated choreographer Bob Fosse could hardly form words. Much later incidentally, Oscar-winner and\nformer cover star of The Rake, Sam Rockwell would portray Bob Fosse in the series Fosse/Verdon.\nDancing or “hoofing” as Rockwell calls it, is actually a skill that he developed early in life and is very good at.\nDespite his silky moves he said: “Playing Bob Fosse is no joke.” Another iconic figure with slick and athletic steps\nas demonstrated in An American in Paris, 1951 Gene Kelly never veered away from his trusty penny loafers,\nwhich says a lot about the artistic versatility of the shoe. And then you see the impact and contribution that\nconverse has had on culture. Fans include: James Dean, Kurt Cobain, Andy Warhol, Patti Smith and Karl Lagerfeld – a\nquintet that collectively have pushed the boundaries of art in different-yet-ground-breaking directions.\nThe point is that shoes, and pairs made my adept artisans for that matter – are not only the result of technical\nguile and artistry – but they have the ability to make much greater impacts through the realms of artistic\nexpression and practice. All those years back in 1919, Nijinsky who mostly wore leather ballet shoes - performed his\nlast dance of note in reference to war, and a nudge over 100 years later, that disturbing performance could suddenly\nhave serious resonance once again.","The Legacy of the Ballets Russes by FIRE AND AIR Assistant Director Sophie Andreassi\nSerge Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes existed for a mere twenty years, and yet it is difficult to overstate the company’s influence on dance, art, music, and design in Western Europe and beyond. From its inception in 1909 to Diaghilev’s death and its dissolution in 1929, the company drew throngs of spectators, eager to witness the product of Diaghilev’s latest, carefully-orchestrated collaborations among promising artists of different disciplines. The itinerant company’s experiments galvanized the art world in their time, and forever altered the trajectory of art and culture in the 21st century.\nDiaghilev capitalized on a vibrant Paris arts scene and engaged his talented circle of Russian émigrés. Artists who secured Diaghilev’s approval were poised to take on a near-cult following. Visual artists and designers such as Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalì, Coco Chanel, Henri Matisse, Joan Miró, Natalia Goncharova, André Derain, Léon Bakst and Georges Braque enjoyed the exposure afforded them by creating works for the company’s stages. The company’s composers included Claude Debussy, Francis Poulenc, Sergei Prokofiev, Erik Satie, Igor Stravinsky, and Richard Strauss. If not already prominent in their field, these and other composers achieved legendary status, especially after the creation of such enduring works as Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring and Debussy’s L’après-midi d’un faune.\nDiaghilev’s choreographic protégés, including Michel Fokine, Vaslav Nijinsky, Bronislava Nijinska, Léonide Massine, Serge Lifar, and a young George Balanchine, tested the viability of currents within modernism at the level of the body while exploring the limits of the classical ballet vocabulary. Significantly, the Ballets Russes challenged the centrality of the idealized female body to ballet. It was the male body was of special importance to Diaghilev’s aesthetic.\nFollowing Diaghilev’s death, offshoots of the company formed to continue to tour the company’s existing repertoire internationally. Over the course of the 1930s and 1940s, national companies on both sides of the Atlantic grew in prominence, often under the purview of Ballets Russes disciples. On the American side, Fokine, Massine, and Nijinska were some of the first choreographers to be engaged by the newly-formed Ballet Theater, now known as American Ballet Theater, in New York in 1939. Balanchine, too, moved to the States and, with Lincoln Kirstein, created the School of American Ballet in 1934 and the New York City Ballet in 1948.\nIn the 1970s, Robert Joffrey, director of the Joffrey Ballet, began a project of reconstructing select pieces from the Ballets Russes canon, inviting Massine to oversee some of his and Fokine’s ballets. Later, Joffrey set about the ambitious project of reviving works by Nijinsky, including Rite of Spring, relying on extensive research by dance historians to attempt to capture the spirit of the piece in the absence of any films.\nUnder Diaghilev’s ingenious, if heavy-handed, supervision, the Ballets Russes reimagined ballet as the fusion of movement, art, and music. The product of these experiments was a rich legacy of innovation and an addicting history that continued to inspire artists, scholars, and the popular imagination through to the present day.\nPhoto: Alexandra Danilova and Serge Lifar in the Ballets Russes’ Apollo (originally Apollon musagète) in 1928."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:29e4568a-0053-48b6-9001-671528681dc8>","<urn:uuid:13fabf4d-0b4c-48f1-85e4-2eb99468e986>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the maintenance requirements for passing vehicle inspections and what specific engine problems can lead to failing smog tests?","answer":"To pass vehicle inspections, cars need proper maintenance including functioning windshield wipers, working parking brakes, good condition tires, and properly working lights. It's recommended to check all bulbs, tire pressure, and use an OBD2 scanner before inspection. For smog tests, several engine problems can cause failure: high hydrocarbon levels indicate unburned fuel due to ignition system issues or catalytic converter failure; high nitro oxide results from excessive combustion chamber heat; high carbon monoxide stems from incomplete combustion; and high carbon dioxide can be caused by weak ignition or contaminated oxygen sensors. Additionally, a lit check engine light or unset readiness flags in the OBD system will result in test failure.","context":["As a vehicle owner, you will have to take it for inspection before you can continue using it. The vehicle inspection might be needed for your brand new car as well as the vehicle you have been using.\nThe whole process of the vehicle inspection entails diagnosis that will ensure that the vehicle is at excellent performance and that it adheres to the state safety laws. This will guarantee not only your safety but also the safety of other motorists on public roads.\nThe big question is “How long does a car inspection take?” A vehicle inspection, generally, may not take more than an hour to be completed. The road test might last for as long as half an hour, and it is the most important part. On the other hand, an inspection of the interior will take 20 minutes at most.\nIn some inspection procedures, other tests, such as the emission tests, might be performed, and this will take close to 15 minutes. These processes might take less time than indicated above if the process systems are at high-speed.\nA car inspection process does not have a specific duration-some inspection service may even take hours.\nSeveral factors will determine the time taken by the whole process, such as the locality of the inspection or where the inspection is conducted.\nIf your vehicle is in perfect condition, you might complete the service within no time.\nCar Inspection Time In The Different States Chart\n|Pennsylvania||20 to 30 mins|\n|New York||1 to 2 hours|\n|North Carolina||15 to 30 mins|\n|Massachusetts||About 12 mins|\n|Texas||15 to 30 mins|\n|Maryland||1 to 2 hours|\n|Virginia||At least 30 mins|\nWhy Is Car Inspection Necessary?\nHaving your vehicle inspected is mandatory by law as it ensures that you are safe and that you don’t put the lives of other road users at risk.\nThere are other reasons that you might want to have your vehicle inspected regularly, they include:\n- It will save you money: Checking the condition of the vehicle regularly will ensure that errors with the performance of the vehicle are detected early and corrected. This will ensure that the vehicle remains well-maintained.\n- Is environmentally friendly: A well-maintained car will be eco-friendly and will not use a lot of fuel. In the end, the environment will be conserved.\n- Time saving: This is true because you will not be dragged down by a vehicle that is not at its top performance. Vehicles in perfect condition don’t take that much time to reach your destination.\n- Improves the lifespan of the vehicle: Checking for errors and correcting them early enhances the lifespan of the vehicle effectively. The diagnosis process of the inspection corrects issues as soon as they are noticed.\n- Ensures compliance with the law: The state safety department might want to have your vehicle inspected at some point. If you had taken the vehicle for inspection recently, you would have no problems as it will comply with the state laws.\n- Guarantees safety of all those in the vehicle: A frequently inspected car is safe for use and is not likely to cause an accident.\n- Prepares the vehicle for sale: An inspection service for your vehicle will be needed before you sell it. This should help point out the issues of the vehicle and have them corrected.\n4 Things I Recommend You To Do Before Taking A Car Inspection\nAs indicated above, the vehicle inspection procedure may last for up to an hour in some cases.\nHowever, if you are looking to speed up the process, the following preparations should help complete the inspection within the shortest time possible:\n1. Acquire An OBD2 Scanner\nAn On-Board Diagnostic (OBD2) scanner works to check the various issues that might be affecting the performance of the vehicle negatively.\nThis should help realize the errors and correcting them before you take the vehicle for an inspection service.\n2. Check All The Tires\nThe next preparation take is checking the tires fixed on the vehicle. It might be time to rotate them and also check the air pressure to ensure it is accurate for each tire.\nYou should also check for wear on the tires and replace the tires that are significantly worn out.\n3. Observe The Windshield Wipers\nMost of the vehicles that undergo the inspection process fail because of issues with the windshield wipers. Therefore, it would be an excellent idea to check on them, and if they are broken, they will have to be replaced.\n4. Check The Bulbs Of The Vehicle\nBefore proceeding to take the vehicle for inspection service, both the interior and exterior bulbs will have to be checked. If you spot any faulty bulbs, you should have them fixed.\nIn many instances, vehicles fail the inspection process because of the above simple complications. You can avoid wasting your time by doing it right in the first instance.\nWhat To Prepare For A Car Inspection\nWhen going to the inspection station, few preparations will be needed to speed up the entire process. These will help avoid wasting your time and increasing the likelihood of the vehicle passing the inspection process.\nThe inspection station will probably be filled with other vehicles that need the service, and you will want to be sharp to get it done as soon as possible.\nSome of the preparation processes include:\n- Carrying all the required documentation.\n- Carry along with proof of the paid insurance and not only the insurance card. This is because more information might be asked concerning insurance coverage.\n- Carry along with your identity cards as well as your driver’s license.\n- Having the required cash or credit card for payment of the inspection service.\nThe Cost Of Car Inspection\nAs indicated above, the car inspection service is not a free service you will have to pay for it. The inspection may be charged as low as $150 and $250 on the upper side. This is the price range for the standard vehicle inspection service.\nWhat Takes Place In A Car Inspection Process?\n- Checking the interior and exterior status of the vehicle: The diagnostic process will begin by checking the external components of the vehicle. This includes components such as the taillights, headlights, suspension system, windshield and wipers. The exhaust pipe may also be checked. For the interior check, the clutch and the brake will be checked if they are in excellent working condition.\n- Performance of a road test: A road test will be performed to check the condition of the engine. This will be needed to ensure the safety of the passengers. The lights of the dashboard and also the brake system will be checked.\n- An emission check: This is a part of the inspection that is important and will determine the success of the inspection. This will check if the vehicle emits hazardous fumes. If a new vehicle fails this test, you can return it to the dealer, but for an old vehicle, you will have to take it for service.\n- Certification: The certification occurs for the vehicles that have passed the inspection service. At this point, the vehicle will receive approval as it will be safe for use. A windshield sticker will be given by the inspection attendant. The certification is also needed for the renewal of the license.\nCar Inspection Process\nThe vehicle inspection process entails a series of procedures.\nThe following is the procedure that will be undertaken by the inspection attendant:\n- Mechanical: This basically includes checking of the mechanical parts of the vehicle. The parts here include the transmission system, the engine, the cooling system and a few others.\n- Undercarriage: This process includes checking of the tires, wheels, braking system, the suspension and other driveline components.\n- Inspection of the body: The thickness of the paint will be measured, and signs of rust and corrosion will be checked. This will be performed for the body panels and the chassis of the vehicle. The attendant will also seek to detect signs of previous accidents that the vehicle might have been involved in.\n- Checking the interior: The interior components of the vehicle such as the dashboard, the gear lever, handbrake, etc. will be checked.\n- Road testing: The performance of the vehicle will be tested by taking it on the road for a short drive.\n- Emission testing: This will check whether the emission of the vehicle is any risk to the immediate environment.\nWhat Reasons To Get A Car Inspected\nSome of the reasons and benefits of having your vehicle inspected include:\n- Guarantees that the vehicle is well maintained.\n- Saves you money since you will be able to detect and repair damaged components of the vehicle.\n- The emission test ensures the conservation of the environment.\n- Driving a vehicle that has recently passed an inspection guarantees safety of passengers.\n- Guarantees compliance with the state laws.\n- Ensures the safety of other road users.\nWhat Happens If A Vehicle Fails Inspection?\nIf the vehicle fails the inspection process, you will have to get it fixed.\nIf it is the engine or the exterior parts that are found to be the cause, you will have to get them repaired or replaced. If you are found driving a car that failed an inspection, you might be fined.\nIn the case that the vehicle fails an emission test, repairs should be done, and the vehicle should undergo a retest within two months.\n5 Reasons To Fail Your Car Inspections\nThe vehicle might fail the inspection because of some of the following reasons:\n- Damaged windshield wipers-which are mostly overlooked. You will have to replace them before taking the vehicle for inspection.\n- Service engine lights that show there is something wrong with the performance of the engine.\n- Faulty lights.\n- The parking brake not working as it should.\n- Worn out tires.\nThe States In America Require Car Inspection\nIn America, 17 states will need the vehicle inspected annually or every two years. Some of these states may also require the same procedure for brand new vehicles.\nSome states like Maryland and Alabama will need an inspection conducted before the transfer of ownership.\nIf you buy a country from outside Nebraska and bring it over, an inspection will be needed by law.\nWhere Can I Get My Car Inspected Near Me?\nAll the inspection servicing stations have been in the business for quite a while.\nThey are well-versed with knowledge about automobiles and know what type of services you as the client would want from a vehicle inspection service.\nSome areas that you can have your vehicle inspected near you include:\n- The National Inspection Services: This is a national inspection service provider that is well versed with the type of inspection that your vehicle needs.\n- The Car Inspector: This is a car inspection service provider that is situated in both the U.S. and Canada.

Carcody – https://carcody.com/how-long-will-a-car-inspection-take/","In many U.S. states, a regular smog check is a requirement for registering your car. Fail to get the test done or fail the test, and you cannot renew your auto registration. No auto registration, no car insurance. Drive without proof of car insurance and current tags, and you’re looking at hefty fines, maybe even suspension of your license, traffic school and other time- and money-sucking penalties. So, actually you don’t want to fail your smog check, but knowing the many ways that you could fail should help you pass it.\nWho Needs a Smog Check?\nEvery state has its own laws regarding smog check requirements. Often, they’re based on the age of your vehicles. In some cases, it depends on where you reside within the state (usually by county) or your residency status. Seventeen states have no requirement. Some require annual checks, others, every two years. And some states waive the requirement for really old cars. If you aren’t sure, check with your state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.\nWhat Are They Checking?\nThe standards for acceptable emission levels are set by the states, following common guidelines established by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. There are different standards for light vehicles (what most of us drive) and heavy duty vehicles like commercial trucks.\nSmog checks use Acceleration Simulation to monitor the emissions of five gases — hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and oxygen. Excessive levels of any of them can indicate that your vehicle is a pollution creator. CarsDirect.com gives these examples of common causes for high gas levels:\n- High hydrocarbon means fuel is going through your engine without being burned. It could be the result of problems with your ignition system, gasket leaks, burned valves or the dreaded (and insanely expensive to replace) catalytic converter failure.\n- High nitro oxide is often caused by excessive heat in the combustion chamber, often caused by a faulty Exhaust Gas Recirculation System\n- High carbon monoxide results from incomplete combustion in the engine, which then leads to high oxygen levels\n- High carbon dioxide is often due to a weak ignition, but it can also be caused by too rich a fuel mixture because of a contaminated oxygen sensor or leaky injectors.\nIf your car is a 1995 or older model, and your state still requires that it be smog checked, the technician will use a Two-Speed Idle to test for emission gases.\nCommon Causes of Functional Inspection Failure\nThe second part of your smog test is the functional inspection, a hands-on look-see at your engine ignition timing, check engine light, gas cap and filler neck and exhaust recirculation valve. It will also include a fuel EVAP test. Typically, most of this work is done by analyzing your On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) computer system. Common opportunities to fail include:\n- Check Engine Light Tests. If it’s lit or fails to light under specific test conditions, you fail.\n- Readiness Flag Tests. 1996 and newer vehicles will fail if readiness flags are not set. Here’s how that works, according to SmogTips.com. “Readiness flags indicate that certain emissions systems which the OBD II computer has been monitoring have passed the internal self-monitoring tests, indicating that those systems are working properly. If the smog machine detects that there are certain readiness flags which have not been set, the data will be relayed to the smog machine and your vehicle will fail the smog test.” A common, but little-known cause of this failure results from a recently disconnected battery. This resets all the readiness flags and you have to put one to three drive cycles on your car to rest the required flags. The Connecticut Emissions Program FAQ page offers these tips for effecting a drive cycle:\n- Drive your car at least three separate times that require you to turn it on and off. One should be local in-town driving, another should be on the highway, and the third should be after the car hasn’t been driven for a prolonged period (e.g. overnight)\n- The gas tank should be ¼ to ¾ full\n- Drive smoothly and avoid rapid acceleration\n- Trouble Code Test. This is not applicable to vehicle model years 1995 or older.\nDo not count on a friendly, understanding technician cutting you any slack. He’s heard every excuse and he’s not going to risk his lucrative state-issued smog test certification status to do you a solid.\nGet It Fixed\nIf you fail, you will be given a report by the inspection tech with details of what you need to repair. Get the work done and take your car back in for a second inspection. If you fail again, you may be able to apply for a smog test waiver, depending on where you live. All this is a big time suck that can best be avoided with regular maintenance.\nIf you pass, congrats. Now make sure your car insurance is current.

{"question":"What are the traditional misconceptions about heart disease in women, and what are the early warning signs to watch for?","answer":"A widespread misconception is that women are less susceptible to heart problems than men, but heart disease actually kills as many American women as men annually and is six times more deadly for women than breast cancer. Many people wrongly believe cancer is women's leading cause of death. As for warning signs, they include chest pressure, squeezing, or burning, shortness of breath, pain in arms, back, or jaw, feeling of fullness, and excessive fatigue. These symptoms can start mild or come and go, increasing in intensity over time. Additionally, women can experience atypical symptoms like sharp pain while coughing or breathing, pain spreading above the jawbone or into the lower body, and labored breathing.","context":["Heart-healthy message for women\nPublished on -2/14/2013, 8:21 AM\nFebruary long has been known as Heart Month. And today, Valentine's Day, it is especially fitting we consider how to help those we love keep their hearts healthy and strong.\nHeart disease often is considered a man's issue. The notion women are less susceptible to heart problems than men is widespread and persistent, but it's wrong. In fact, heart disease kills as many American women as men every year, and accounts for more deaths among women than the next seven causes of death combined.\nDespite the fact heart disease is women's No. 1 killer, many people mistakenly believe cancer is the leading cause of death for women. In America, heart disease kills six times as many women as breast cancer. A woman's risk for heart disease increases two to three times after menopause, with women of color having an even higher risk than whites.\nLong neglected by researchers, heart disease in women finally is getting attention. One of the most significant findings is women often have different risk factors and different symptoms than men and are treated differently by doctors.\nOn average, women are 10 years older than men when they're diagnosed with heart disease. One theory is the hormone estrogen protects them until menopause. But sometimes women are mis-diagnosed because their symptoms are different from men's. Unfortunately, by the time heart disease is diagnosed in women, it's often at a more advanced stage. Even if they're having a heart attack, women wait longer than men to seek care.\nThe danger signs of heart attack often differ in men and women. Pain is the first symptom for both, although men tend to have the classic heavy, crushing chest pain, while women have the more transient discomfort of angina. Other symptoms in women are more vague -- indigestion, fatigue, nausea or sleeplessness.\nIf you or a friend experience any of the following warning signs of a heart attack, call 911:\n* Chest discomfort, pressure, squeezing, fullness or pain in the center of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes, or goes away and comes back.\n* Discomfort or pain in one or both arms, the back, neck, jaw or stomach.\n* Shortness of breath, which often occurs at the same time as, but can occur before, chest discomfort.\n* Other signs such as breaking out in a cold sweat, nausea, vomiting or light-headedness.\nGiven what experts know about heart disease, what can women do to protect themselves?\nFirst, recognize women, too, can have heart disease. Women historically have been more afraid of breast cancer than heart disease, but now almost half of American women recognize heart disease as their No. 1 enemy.\nLearn about the signs and risk factors of heart disease and work to reduce your risks.\nListen to your body, then speak up. Doctors across the country report women, even those already diagnosed with heart disease, downplay the seriousness of their condition.\nTake care of yourself.

However, if recognized in time, these “beginnings” can even be treated before the heart is damaged.\nHow can you prevent a heart attack?\nEven if you don’t think you’re personally at risk, it’s important for everyone to learn how to prevent a heart attack and help others. This includes:\nUnderstanding the risk factors and immediately seeing a doctor for early diagnosis.\n- Learning the signs and symptoms of a heart attack. These signs occur differently in men and women.\n- Be alert for a heart attack in yourself or someone in your vicinity. Becoming an active bystander could save a life!\n- When in doubt, call 9-1-1. First responders have the medical technology to quickly save a life.\n- Take the Early Heart Attack Care (EHAC) Pledge to save a life.\nWhat is EHAC?\nEarly Heart Attack Care (or EHAC) is knowing the subtle danger signs of a heart attack and acting upon them immediately - before heart damage occurs. That’s because 85 percent of heart damage occurs within the first two hours of a heart attack. EHAC not only saves lives, it protects the quality of life.\nLearn the early signs & symptoms\nSomeone may experience any or all of these symptoms. When they start, they can be mild or come and go. Over time, the symptoms and pain increase until the victim collapses.\n- Chest pressure, squeezing, aching, or burning\n- Shortness of breath\n- Pain that travels down one or both arms\n- Back pain\n- Feeling of fullness\n- Jaw pain\n- Excessive fatigue\nHowever, heart attack symptoms look different in men and women. And it's crucial to stay alert because women are less likely to seek immediate medical care and are more likely to die.\nMen v. Women. What is the difference?\n- Men normally feel pain and numbness in the left arm or side of chest, but in women, these symptoms may appear on the right side.\n- Women may feel completely exhausted, drained, dizzy or nauseous.\n- Women may feel upper back pain that travels up into their jaw.\n- Women may think their stomach pain is the flu, heartburn or an ulcer.\nAtypical signs and symptoms\nAnd for both men and women, there are atypical presentations of heart attack symptoms. For example, he or she may not complain about pain or pressure in the chest.

{"question":"As a martial arts instructor, I'm interested in understanding how the concept of circularity compares between Wu-Wei Dao and Tai Chi movements. What are the key similarities and differences?","answer":"Both martial arts systems emphasize circularity, but with distinct approaches. In Wu-Wei Dao, circular movements are primarily expressed through the concept of 'economy of action' and 'flowing with an attacker's energy rather than opposing it head on,' similar to Aikido's principles. The system focuses on utilizing an attacker's force and moving along lines of least resistance. In Tai Chi, circularity is more systematically defined - all movements come from circles, with arm circles following body circles. Tai Chi practitioners must stay within the circle, with body turns limited to 90 degrees to maintain proper form. The body movement itself is circular, and the system emphasizes that without proper circles, energy cannot be released effectively. Both systems integrate the yin-yang philosophy of balance, with Wu-Wei Dao representing this through its logo's blue (soft) and red (hard) elements, while Tai Chi applies it directly to movement principles and energy cultivation.","context":["The philosophy behind the Wu-Wei Dao martial system\nThe Academy of Traditional Fighting Arts calls its martial system \"Wu-Wei Dao\". This term is made up of 3 Chinese characters 無為道 for which we use the Mandarin pronunciation (the Cantonese pronunciation is Mo-Wai Dao and the Japanese pronunciation is Muido).\nThe literal meaning of the first character 無 (wu) is \"nothingness\".\nThe character 為 (wei) means \"action\" or \"result\".\nThe character 道 (dao) means \"way\" or \"path\".\nIn combination wu-wei denotes a state of nothingness from which anything can arise. The practical application of this concept is to be found in the martial arts maxim mizu no kokoro or \"mind like water\" or in the Academy Motto: \"be calm in mind and swift in action\". It is vital for a martial artist to develop responses to threats that are both spontaneous and effective since there is rarely any time in combat for considered thought. It is for this reason that training in the Academy often involves continuous repetition of techniques (a process known as \"grooving\"). However in order to rely on the results of this training a martial artist needs to have a clear, uncluttered and focused mind; a mind that is like the waters of a still lake on which every ripple is noticed. In view of the above it is possible to read Wu-Wei Dao as \"the way of action that springs from nothingness\" or \"the way of spontaneous action\".\nIt is also possible to read wu-wei as \"achieving a result by doing nothing\". This concept expresses the Academy's philosophy of achieving a desired result without conflict or, if conflict is unavoidable, with as little conflict as possible. In this regard Wu-Wei Dao is not dissimilar in meaning from the term budo (武道) or \"the martial way\", since the character for bu (武) is made up of 2 elements, one being \"the sword\", and the other being \"never to be used\" . Some may find it odd that the practice of a violent activity should have what is apparently a pacifist philosophy, however underlying this \"paradox of the martial arts\" is the truism that conflict is best managed by being diffused. And it is by understanding our own violent nature and potential that we can best understand and manage violence in others.\nMaster Azato (one of the karate teachers of Gichin Funakoshi - founder of Shotokan karate) said:\n\"A true martial artist is one who's smile will warm the hearts of little children, and who's anger will make tigers cower in fear.\"\nOn a more immediate level the concept of \"achieving a result by doing nothing\" is embodied in the techniques of the Wu-Wei Dao system which are based on economy of action. This frequently takes the form of utilizing an attacker's force against him/her or moving along the \"lines of least resistance\". Accordingly Wu-Wei Dao has a meaning similar to Aikido which means \"the way harmonizing energy\", a reference to flowing with an attacker's energy rather than opposing it head on.\nLastly, it is important to note that the character wu (無) refers to the kind of \"nothingness\" associated with the sky and thus carries with it the connotation of infinite potential or possibility. In this regard it has the same meaning as Kara in Karate which means \"empty as the sky\" rather than empty in the ordinary sense of the word. It is in the context of this interpretation that we approach the wider philosophical meaning of wu-wei.\nThe above attempts to define wu-wei emphasize the fact that it is not capable of being described or understood by reference to a handful of words. It is an ancient and profound concept drawn principally from the Daoist (or Taoist) philosophy.\nDaoist philosophical thought has its origins in a number of ancient Chinese classical texts, the most significant being Lao Zi's Dao-De Jing or \"the Way and its Power\". Other texts with varying emphases and perspectives include the Juang Zi and the Lie Zi named after their respective authors.\nWu-wei can be described as a chief characteristic of Daoist philosophy or, as Benjamin Hoff puts it in his entertaining Tao of Pooh, it is \"the most characteristic element of Taoism in action\". (Another characteristic of Daoism relevant to the Academy of Traditional Fighting Arts is the concept of bu or \"the uncarved block\", encapsulated in the Academy Motto or \"Dojo Kun\": \"lead a simple life\".)\nEssentially wu-wei can be described as working with the laws of nature (what the Chinese call the Dao) rather than against them. An example of this would be the importance of swimming with a strong current rather than trying to oppose it. In fact the softness yet power of water is a metaphor frequently used by philosophers to describe the concepts of Dao and wu-wei.\nIt is important to note that the \"power\" harnessed from nature need not be overt; it may involve simply understanding human motivations and working with them to achieve a goal (in the case of martial arts, to resolve conflict). Sometimes wu-wei may mean utilizing a smile to diffuse a hostile situation. In other cases wu-wei may involve actual combat. Depending on the circumstance, it can involve practically any response.\nIf you think this sounds a lot like common sense, you may be correct. But wu-wei involves more than the application of mere intelligence: it requires wisdom. It is for this reason that the Academy has adopted the slogan \"martial arts for the thinking person\".\nA frequently asked question about wu-wei\n\"Does wu-wei mean 'do nothing'?\"Answer:\n\"Wu-wei means \"no action\" literally. But it should not be read as an instruction. This is a description of an ideal situation, ie. where you have to take \"no action\" and yet you achieve your desired outcome. In practical terms, the less you have to do to achieve your objective, the more you have utilised wu-wei. In other words it does not, strictly speaking, mean \"do nothing\". It means \"effecting your goal without having to do anything\" or letting something develop or flow on its own accord. You don't get very far (at least not easily) by opposing the natural development or flow. You can't hasten it. Instead, a wise person will fully use it to his or her advantage.\"\nThe Academy's logo\nThe blue (or alternatively transparent) half of the logo denotes yin or \"softness\". The red denotes yang or \"hardness\". These must be in balance for a technique to be effective. It is important to note that at no stage is any technique purely \"hard\" or \"soft\": in varying degrees every technique has both attributes. This is reflected in the fact that there is a spot of red in the blue/transparent half of the circle and a corresponding blue/transparent spot in the red half.\nAcademy mottoes (dojo kun)\n- Be courteous and honourable.\n- Train according to your physical condition.\n- Study earnestly and creatively.\n- Be calm in mind and swift in action.\n- Take care of your health.\n- Lead a simple life.\n- Never be arrogant.\n- Persevere in your training.\nThe dojo kun as it appears in the Jundokan dojo of the late Ei'ichi Miayzato, successor to Chojun Miyagi.\n(Image from http://hk.geocities.com/sudokan_hongkong/Photo05.htm.)\nChinese version (Translation by L Chan 2007.)","Correct Principles of Tai Chi Practice - Liu Yong\nBefore Tai Chi there were many other styles of Wushu or martial arts.\nTai Chi was developed approximately 100 years before the gun. When\nguns became popular Tai Chi began to change its emphasis. As it was no\nlonger needed for self-defence, it began to evolve into a sport. However\nsome people felt that Tai Chi was too good a Martial Art to lose, and\nkept this side of it going. In the last century, as China became more\nopen, Tai Chi was able to spread. Yang Luchan took it to Beijing, and\nlater Chen Fa Ke taught there. Today it has spread around the world.\nTai Chi is a combination of\n2) Chinese Medicine\n3) Acupuncture- Jing Luo\n4) Yin Yang philosophy\nTai Chi can be described as\n1) Chinese Culture\nToday more people see Tai Chi as a sport, an exercise system. Very few\npeople can recognise it as Wushu or Chinese Culture. You must open\nyour heart to know/understand Tai Chi.\nProgression in Learning\n2) Gung fu\nArms and body move together. Many people can understand the hand\nmovements, but do not see the body movement. Tai Chi is a circle.\nMany people can make the arm circles but are not relaxed enough to\nmake the body circles. All movements are from a circle. The arm circle\nfollows the body circle. Do not go outside of the circle. The body\nmovement is a circle. Do not turn the body to the maximum, always\nleave a little. The body should turn 90 degrees. Never overturn. The\nbody needs to relax first, then make the movement. After three years\nstudents should be able to understand this level.\nWhen you turn the body the weight changes sides. If the body turns to\nthe right, the left leg takes the weight. One leg is relaxed and one is not\nrelaxed. When the body turns, the hands follow. If the hands alone\nmove (without the body) the movement is incorrect. By moving the\nbody, the hands can move further The body has three parts. The middle\npart, between the navel and the hips must be loose and flexible and able\nto rotate. If the upper part is too strong, the middle will not be able to\nrelax and move. If the legs are too weak, the weight will be in the top of\nthe body and there will be no root. For Tai Chi strong legs are important.\nAs you get older, the legs are the first things to grow weak.\nWhen the body is relaxed qi goes first to the dantian, then to the legs\nand the feet. When the legs are strong, the back will be strong. Tai Chi\nbreathing is not upper chest breathing. When you breathe using natural\nbreathing, you are stronger. Tai Chi develops the use of natural breathing.\nWith continued practice, you will be able to use natural breathing all\nthe time, not just when you practice Tai Chi.\nMore practice builds up the qi in the dantian. The dantian becomes like\na football. More qi makes you stronger. However it is very slow to\ndevelop, the qi builds up gradually. Building up the qi is like a seed\nArm movements come from the body\nBody movements come from qi\nQi comes from practice\nWhen the Tai Chi movements are correct, the body is relaxed and the qi\nTai Chi is fast and slow movements. The fast movements come from the\nslow ones. Fast – from slow - from relaxation – from the circle.\nFa Jing is very relaxed, not tense, and very circular.\nRelax + Circle = Fa Jing\nWithout the circle you cannot release. If you\nare tense or stiff and have no circles, energy\nXin Jia (Chen Style New Frame) is\nfast and slow alternating. The\nmovements are relaxed like a fish\nswimming in water. First practice\nslowly to feel if the circles are\ncorrect and to make sure you are relaxed. Lao Jia\n(Chen Style Old Frame) lets you feel slow movement, lets you feel the circles,\nand lets you feel relaxed. If you can feel this first in Lao Jia, then you will be\nable to feel this in Xin Jia. Practice Lao Jia every day to develop this feeling.\nXin Jia is different because it has many small movements. If you understand\nthe big movements in Lao Jia (which has no small movements) then you will be\nable to build in the movements in Xin Jia. Finally you will be able to understand\nFa Jing. This is the correct road for developing Tai Chi. Improvements take\ntime to develop. It cannot happen quickly. You can only make improvements\nfor yourself by practising every day. This is the principle for all the Tai Chi\nOne principle “turn body” can make a thousand movements just as one tree\ncan make a thousand leaves.\nTai Chi is about 400 years old but Chinese Culture has been developing for\naround 2000 – 3000 years. To improve your Tai Chi you need to understand\nmore Chinese Culture.\na) Understand about Yin and Yang.\nWhen you understand the changes between Yin and Yang, you can apply this\nto your movements.\nb) Chinese Medicine\nLearn about the Jing Luo system.\nThe Dai Mai circles the body (like a belt) around the waist. The Du Mai and\nthe Ren Mai circle up the back and down the front of the body. These Jing Luo\nform circles. All of the others are lines. So these three are Tai Chi Jing Luo.\nDai Mai is the most important Jing Luo for Tai Chi. When the qi goes through\nthe Dai Mai the qi becomes strong. If your qi can pass through these channels\nyour gung fu will be very strong.\nc) Tai Chi is an Art/Sport\nArt and movement are different, but the feeling is the same. Tai Chi is a body\nlanguage, like a song for the body.\nTai Chi is like ballet, like music and like calligraphy. All of these things have\ncombinations of fast and slow. Artistic people can understand Tai Chi quicker.\nIf you can understand other art forms then you will understand and appreciate\nd) Sun Tzu, Art of War\nBecause Tai Chi is a Martial Art, this is a good book to read. Push Hands\nrelates to this and especially Competition Push Hands.\nIf you understand the mechanics of movement, you will understand how to\nmove from one posture to the next.\nTai Chi is old knowledge and modern knowledge combined. If Western culture\nhas the same principles these can also be used to explain Tai Chi.\nMaster Liu Yong was formally accepted as an Indoor Student of Grandmaster\nChen Zheng Lei in 1996. He lives in Lian Yun Gang, Jiangsu, China.

{"question":"What is the key difference in cooling rates between annealing and normalizing steel?","answer":"The key difference is that normalizing uses a faster cooling rate in room temperature air, while annealing requires a slower, controlled cooling process in a furnace. The ideal cooldown rate for annealing steel is about 70°F per hour down to about 500°F, while normalizing allows the metal to cool freely in air at a much faster rate.","context":["Annealing is a heat treating process that softens steel. This can make it easier to form or machine. It’s especially useful if you need to cut something that’s been welded up, like when you need to repair stripped threads on a shaft.\nMetal is made up of a crystalline structure which directly relates to its mechanical properties. If you can modify the structure, you can adjust its hardness, malleability, toughness, tensile strength, and a whole slew of other things.\nSo how do you anneal steel?\nTo anneal steel, heat it up about 100 degrees F above its critical temperature, soak it at that temp for 1 hour per inch of thickness, and let it cool at a maximum rate of 70 F per hour.\nOk, that’s the short answer. Let’s go over how to do this in real life, depending on the tools you have access to, along with a few tips and tricks to help you get it (mostly) right the first time.\nHow to Anneal Steel\nIn order to anneal steel, you’re going to need a way of heating up the metal until it’s bright red, hold it at that temperature for a while, and then very slowly allow it to cool.\nThere are two main approaches to this: using a torch, forging furnace, or other non-regulated source of heat, or using a programmable heat treating oven.\nUsing a Heat Treating Oven\n- Most controlled process, most consistent results\n- Best way to fully anneal steel, right to the core\n- If the oven is programmable, you can set it and walk away\n- Really effective for parts with variable thicknesses\n- Can be unnecessarily time consuming for small parts, or if a full anneal isn’t important\n- Heat treating ovens aren’t readily accessible to a lot of people\nTo execute this properly, it’s best to know the exact grade of steel you’re working with. If you bought the steel from a supplier, check with them for the recommended annealing temperature.\nTo be honest, it doesn’t really vary all that much – typically you’ll be annealing in the range of 1450-1650 F or so, but it’s still ideal to get an exact temperature to fully anneal the metal.\nIf you really have no clue what the steel is, I usually just start at 1500 F and try again at 1550 F if it doesn’t work as planned (repeat in increments of 50 as needed). Not the most effective method by a long shot, but it usually works. It’s ok to go a little too hot as long as you don’t melt the steel.\nOnce the oven is up to temperature, you’re going to need to let the metal “soak” – these means just holding it at that temperature. What this does is allow the metal to get hot enough inside, so it’ll be fully annealed the whole way through.\nA rule of thumb for this is to soak the metal for one hour for every inch of thickness.\nIf you’re working with a really inconsistently shaped piece of steel that’s thicker in some sections than others, just go with the thickest section. So if the part is a shaft that’s 4″ diameter on the thick end and 2″ diameter on the small end, let it soak for 4 hours.\nThe nice thing about using heat treating ovens is that aside from having a really exact temperature, slow cooling is very easy. Just turn off the oven and keep the door closed. The fire bricks will hold the heat long enough to really control the cool down.\nAlternatively, some ovens will let you program the cooldown rate. In that case, set it to 70 F per hour.\nYou can pull the part out before it’s fully cool – it’s fine if it’s still a couple hundred degrees. I find that usually if I program the oven in the afternoon and start the cycle, the part will be ready to pull out in the morning. Unless it’s a massive 8″ thick block, that is – it would take 8 hours just to soak it!\nOnce it’s cool enough to touch, test it with your preferred method for checking hardness to make sure that the process worked as planned.\nUsing a Torch\n- Really quick for smaller parts, like wires or clips\n- A torch is generally more accessible to most people\n- Once you have an eye for steel colors at high temperatures, you don’t necessarily need to know the exact grade of steel\n- Trickier to get a full anneal, achieving maximum malleability\n- Takes more skill\n- Time consuming for larger parts\n- Very challenging for parts with variable thicknesses\nThis, in my opinion, is the runner-up in terms of annealing processes. If you can use an oven, you’ll pretty well always get better results with that instead of a torch.\nThat said, using a torch will work just fine most of the time. Here’s the process, with a few tips to make success more likely:\nEspecially if you’re working on larger pieces (like 1″ or thicker) try using a rosebud tip on an oxyfuel system. You’ll have an easier time heating up the metal consistently, without overheating certain sections.\nKeep the flame away from any small, thin sections of the part. These will be really easy to get too hot and melt. If there are variable thicknesses, try putting the flame on the thicker part and allow the heat to work its way to the thinner sections.\nGet the part a nice and orange-red. If there’s one thing to memorize from this, this is it: cherry red is for heat treating, orange-red is for annealing. If you’re not sure about the color of steel at various temperatures, I made this downloadable resource:\nIt also includes the colors at lower temperatures, which are usually used for tempering. Print it out and tape it on to your toolbox.\nKeep in mind, though, that depending on your printer ink, monitor display, and the grade of steel, it may not match perfectly to the actual temp of the hot metal. It ain’t perfect, but it’s a decent guide to get started.\nAnother tip: Try to avoid annealing in direct sunlight. It’ll make it really hard to judge the color of the steel, so you could easily end up overcooking it. Do it inside a shop or garage if you can.\nOne more way of checking that the steel is hot enough is to check it with a magnet. Steel loses its magnetism once it’s at its “critical temperature”. So go smash open an old TV or microwave forone of those big, chunky magnets in the name of good workmanship!\nOnce it loses its magnetism, let it continue to brighten up just a little bit, since annealing needs to be done about 100 F above the critical temperature.\nHeat up the metal nice and steadily, and give it enough time to get hot in the center, too. Once it’s that beautiful orange-red, now comes the tricky part: slowing the cool.\nSlow Cooling Options\nAir cooling is too fast for annealing, so you’ll need to help the part to retain its heat once the torch is off. Here are a few ways of doing this:\nDry Sand or Vermiculite\nThis can be an effective way of keeping the part warmer for longer.\nVermiculite is something that’s added to soil to make plants happy, and it’s also a great insulator. Sand is great for retaining heat, too. One thing worth noting is that it needs to be pretty pure stuff, you don’t want any roots or mud in the mix if at all possible. Construction or play sand work well.\nDo not use sand or vermiculite that is moist.\nMoisture + red hot glowing metal = undesireable results. Basically, it just won’t retain the heat, the part will cool down too quickly, and you’ll have to redo the annealing. There are also stories floating around the internet about things exploding when there’s moisture. I think that this is more of a problem with larger stones/bricks, which can crack and explode when the moisture turns to steam, but it’s best to err on the side of caution and avoid explosions when possible.\nIt’s best to just totally bury the metal to really insulate it. If you’re doing something the size of a knife, then let it sit in a 5 gallon pail of the stuff. It’s cheap and reusable so don’t be stingy.\nIf you’re looking for vermiculite, you can pick it up on Amazon fairly cheap, or you can check around at local home/garden stores.\nThis is convenient since there’s less of a potential for making a mess, and you can roll it up and put it back on the shelf very easily.\nThere are a few different kinds that work perfectly fine. You can get blankets for chimneys and wood stoves that are really effective. Another good option is to pick up a roll of ceramic fiber insulation, which will usually be pretty easy on the budget and will last you a while.\nTrick for Cooling Small Parts\nSome parts are small enough to be next to impossible to slow cool unless they’re in an oven. Here’s one way around that:\nHeat up a larger block of metal or two along with the small part that you’re annealing. When you put it in the insulation, put the larger hot block(s) in contact with the small piece. That will keep it hot long enough to get a nice, slow cool for annealing. It’s a solid way of making steel take many hours to cool.\nThe ideal cooldown rate for annealing steel is about 70 F per hour, down to about 500 F. In other words, a piece of steel that’s cooling from 1500 F to 500 F should ideally take about 14 hours. Actual ideal times will vary by grade of steel, but that’s a decent rule of thumb. Lots of guys like to let it take 24 hours, but personally I find that to be a bit unnecessary unless it’s a special grade of steel.\nWhat Steels Can Be Annealed\nGenerally speaking, it’s tool steels that are most commonly annealed. You’ll need to soften the steel to be able to cut or bend it.\nAlloy steels can also be worthwhile to anneal, but this is where you should get to know your grades. Depending on the alloy, the annealing temperatures might vary a lot more than you’re expecting.\nAnything that can be hardened can be annealed. You won’t see much of a change in something that’s really low carbon, like 1018 mild steel. In something like a 4140, though, the results can be very noticeable.\nHow to Tell What Material You’re Working With\nThis is the tricky part. Ideally, you bought the metal from a supplier, and they can tell you the exact grade and heat treating temperatures.\nIn real life, though, this isn’t always the case.\nThis is where torch annealing really shines. Just heat it up orange-red, slow cool it, and don’t worry about it. Otherwise, it really helps to know what kinds of steel are common for different applications.\nGoogle is your friend, too. Just try searching something like “what grade of steel is ____ made from” and see what comes up.\nHere are a few guidelines for common mystery metals:\n|Shafts||For light-duty shafts, usually a mild steel is used, which won’t need annealing. Heavier-duty shafts are often made from 4140 steel. Anneal at 1600 F.|\n|Springs||Leaf springs and coil springs from vehicles are usually made from a 5160 or equivalent steel. Not always, though. For 5160, anneal it at 1450 F.|\n|Rebar||Your guess is as good as mine. Rebar is made from whatever scrap metal is available, and it’s not very consistent, either. You could have one end of the bar that’s dead soft mild steel, and the other end of the same bar that’s fully hard. Just torch anneal it by eye and hope for the best. If you want to know more about rebar, check out this article about what it’s made from.|\n|Rail Spike/Track||Again, not always the most consistent in terms of composition. Usually, tracks will tend to be more heat treatable than spikes. Fairly often it will be something similar to an A36, which can be annealed at around 1550-1600 F. Check out this article for spikes and this article for tracks to learn more about common compositions.|\n|Structural Steel (I Beams, C Channel, Etc)||The most common structural steel is A36, although there are variations. This is more consistently used for the heavy-duty stuff, like industrial construction. For the small stuff, it could still be A36, or it could just as likely be something else. Anneal at 1550-1600 F.|\nWhat’s the difference between annealing and tempering?\nAnnealing fully softens the metal, making it malleable, whereas tempering simply reduces the brittleness of the metal. Annealing is done at high temperatures, usually at about 1500 F for steels. Tempering is done at low temperatures, typically up to about 500 F. Typically tempering is done after a hardening process to relieve internal stresses and prevent future catastrophic failure.\nWhat’s the difference between annealing and normalizing?\nAnnealing is a very slow, controlled cooling process, whereas normalizing is cooled much faster in open air. Normalizing is primarily done to reduce internal stress and make the grain structure more uniform. Normalized steel is usually partially hard, instead of fully soft like annealed steel.\nNormalizing is also significantly cheaper, since the parts are cooled in open air instead of sitting inside an expensive furnace, slowing down production.\nCan I anneal other metals, like copper?\nCopper can be annealed, although the process is slightly different. The temperature for annealing copper is typically 700 F, or a glowing red color. The main difference is that annealing copper doesn’t require slow cooling; actually, a rapid water quench will likely give the best results.\nOther metals can be annealed based on grade and type. Brass, silver, and certain grades of aluminum can be softened by this process.","Normalizing is a widely popular heat treatment process for metals to increase ductility and toughness. This heat treatment is also known as normalizing annealing as the normalizing heat treatment process is very similar to annealing treatment. In this article we will learn more about normalizing; its definition, purposes, process steps, applicability, normalizing vs annealing, etc.\nNormalizing Definition/ What is normalizing?\nNormalizing is defined as a heat treatment process where a material is heated to a predecided elevated temperature, hold at that temperature for a certain period of time (usually 10-20 minutes), and then allowed to cool freely in the air to reach room temperature. The normalizing process is usually applied to metals that have been subjected to thermal or mechanical hardening processes and require their microstructure to be normalized. After normalizing, the metal gets back its ductility and the hardness is reduced.\nMetals Suitable to be Normalized\nFor the normalizing treatment of a metal, it must be receptive to normalizing. Various metals and alloys are suitable to be normalized like\n- Iron-based alloys like Carbon steel, stainless steel, alloy steel, cast iron, etc.\n- Nickel alloys\nPurpose of Normalizing\nThe main purposes of the normalizing heat treatment on metals are:\n- To remove structural irregularities or impurities and defects from the metal.\n- To improve ductility that has been lost in some metal processing.\n- To reduce the hardness that has been increased by mechanical or thermal hardening processes.\n- To increase the toughness of the metal.\n- To relieve internal stresses.\n- To get an improvement in machinability.\nThe Normalizing Process\nSimilar to annealing the normalizing process also follows three main stages; the Recovery stage, the Recrystallization stage, and the grain-growth stage. In the recovery stages of normalizing, the internal stresses are relieved by heating the material. Then the metal is heated to elevated temperatures above the recrystallization temperature of the metal where new grains are formed. Finally, in the grain growth stage of normalization, the grains develop fully when the material is cooled by air.\nApplications for Normalizing\nNormalizing treatment finds broad practical applications across several industries like Aerospace, Automotive, Heavy Equipment, Energy, Agriculture, Oil & Gas, etc. Usually, whenever metal is expected to get high residual stresses due to some kind of manufacturing steps, it is always suggested to normalize the metal using the normalizing heat-treatment process. A few examples include:\n- Carbon steel is normalized when it is cold-rolled to reduce brittleness and increase ductility.\n- After work hardening of ferritic stainless steel stampings in the automotive industry, they are normalized to regain their mechanical properties.\n- After the thermal microstructure alteration during welding in nickel-based alloys in the nuclear industry, normalizing is performed.\nSteel normalizing is a heat treatment process performed after rolling, welding, or forging processes to refine the distorted grains in the microstructure. The normalizing process of steel involves the following steps:\n- Steel is heated to about 40-500C (Refer to Fig. 1) above the upper critical temperature (A3 or Acm).\n- The alloy is then held at that temperature for around 10-20 minutes.\n- Cooling it in still or slightly agitated air to bring back to room temperature.\nAfter normalizing, the resultant microstructure is usually perlite. The grain size in normalizing steel is governed by the section thickness. A variation in grain size is observed as the cooling rate varies from the case to the core. The normalizing temperature of steel varies with the carbon content as is clear from Fig. 1. The following table (Table 1) provides recommended normalizing temperatures for steel.\nDifference between Normalizing and Annealing\nEven though the process steps for normalizing and annealing are almost similar there are specific differences between normalizing and annealing. The differences between annealing and normalizing are provided below in a tabular (Table 2) format.\n|The cooling rate in normalizing is faster than annealing.||Slower cooling rate as compared to normalizing.|\n|Slow cooling in room temperature.||Controlled slow cooling in a furnace.|\n|Mechanical Strength and hardness of normalized components are more.||Strength and hardness are lower as compared to the normalized parts.|\n|Machinability is more improved in normalizing.||Annealed product is soft and thus can stick to the machine during machining.|\n|Slightly less ductility.||More ductility.|\n|Less expensive||Comparatively costly|\nThe image in Fig. 2 shows the typical differences in nominal strength between Normalized and Annealed steel.\n5 thoughts on “What is Normalizing?

{"question":"What contrasts exist between how the Bribri and ancient Maya use cacao in their religious practices?","answer":"The Bribri and Maya exhibit different religious practices involving cacao. The Bribri maintain strict gender-based traditions where only women can prepare and serve cocoa drinks in sacred rituals, reflecting their matrilineal social structure. Their practices focus on ceremonial uses and purification rituals. The Maya, however, incorporated cacao more broadly into their cosmological understanding, using it as a symbolic bridge between the underworld, earth, and heavens. They emphasized cacao's role in death and resurrection, planting cacao trees at burial sites and featuring them in funerary art. The Maya also integrated cacao into their origin story, where it played a role in the creation of the sun, moon, and humans.","context":["The indigenous Bribri culture of Costa Rica:\nThe world knows Costa Rica as a destination of breathtaking scenery, from haunting cloud forests to lush jungle rainforests, from tropical beaches to lush green mountains. But there is much more to this beautiful country, the people and their culture is what makes it so special and unique.\nCosta Rica is home to around eight main indigenous groups, with the Bribri population being the country’s largest indigenous group in Limon Province. Deep in the southern Caribbean region of Costa Rica, near the border with Panama, the indigenous Bribri people reside scattered throughout the Talamanca mountain range and the southern islands isolated from others.\nOff the beaten track, far from the dominant society and influences, isolated, they fight for their independence and self-sufficiency allowing them to preserve their indigenous culture. Some have traveled to live across Costa Rica, however, a large percentage continue to live in this region.\nThe name Bribri\nTranslated into Spanish, Bribri est valiente, which means courageous, courageous and valiant in English. It is the essence of the indigenous Bribri people that stands the test of time, maintaining their beliefs, traditions and culture.\nThey mainly speak two languages, Spanish, and one of their own, the Bribri language which is a chibchan language from Central America that they continue to preserve through the generations. This is often said in their homes and among families, in their spiritual centers and in their traditional ceremonies.\nTheir tribal name of Bribri comes from the word which means mountainous and rugged terrain when translated from their language, which is considered a tone language that uses an SOV, subject-object-word order of words. There are three different dialects spoken which have been named after the groups that use them Salitre-Cabagra, (Pacific) Coroma (East) and Katsi-Amubre (West).\nThe villages are remote and isolated, with some sometimes traveling by river to reach their destination. However, this is what allows them to survive in their way of life, far from the influence of the peoples retaining their societies. Running water is available most often in the villages, however, electricity is limited as they have chosen to live without the technology and influences of the modern world. Villages consist of schools, community buildings, assembly and meeting houses, and conical huts which are their centers of spiritual practice.\nThe indigenous Bribri lead sustainable lives, depend on themselves, and have created a barter system to use indoors and, if necessary, sell their unique art, crafts and chocolate culture to tourists. Most single family homes are traditional and rustic in nature, some wooden huts on stilts with thatched roofs made of wood or woven from palm fronds.\nThere is a lot of space between them keeping them apart but close enough to still be able to walk towards each other. They maintain their existence relying on agriculture producing their own organic food in their fertile gardens, with chickens on the property providing eggs and other necessary animals. Meals consist of traditional foods such as chicken, rice, beans, yucca and other fresh vegetables, and of course chocolate.\nTheir main source of income comes from growing and harvesting bananas, plantains and cocoa. However, they easily grow oranges, corn, coffee, beans, rice, and native root crops. Ecotourism has helped as a source of income to educate people about their traditional way of life and to provide insight into their world. This sustainable tourism generates income to help build their villages and community centers as well as funds to buy what they cannot grow on their own.\nThey welcome small groups to their village to experience the Bribri culture by learning their respect for nature by walking in the forest, sharing their knowledge of all the plants and trees among them and their amazing medicinal properties. Visitors may have the opportunity to try an authentic snack that they commonly eat, served straight from a banana leaf.\nThey raise awareness of cocoa and why it is so important and respected, from traditional and medicinal uses and sacred rituals to tasting and visualizing the entire process of chocolate production. Watching how the cocoa pod is opened, the beans are roasted and cooled before being crushed and ground into chocolate creating a whole new intimate experience before savoring its pure flavor.\nCocoa plays an important cultural role in the history and life of the Bribri, as it has helped maintain their livelihoods and sacred belief system. It is their belief that the cocoa tree is that of a female, who was previously a female but was turned into a cocoa tree as a sign of appreciation by Sibu, their main deity and creator. Traditions followed that the branches of the cocoa tree should not be used as firewood and that only women could prepare and serve their cocoa drink in sacred rituals.\nIt is featured and prominent in special occasions, purification rituals, ceremonies and rites of passage within the culture. Even within their natural medicine, cocoa has a role, whether it is for stretch marks or in a mixture to bring down fever, it is their devout gift.\nWithin Bribri society, women have a central role because the structured clan system is matrilineal, so the mother’s family will determine the roles that one will have. It also means that the clan to which the mother belongs determines the clan of the child. Women are the ones who inherit the land through the generations and will generally be responsible for looking after the livestock.\nThe indigenous Bribri people strive to maintain their culture and ancient traditions by preserving their heritage. Although they are independent and isolated from the population, they are united among themselves to form a healthy and self-sufficient community. The preservation of their community thrives through their dedication to being at one with nature, respecting it and protecting it in order to maintain a harmonious balance.\nThe independence and the way of life of the Bribri have much to be admired, as they use their natural resources responsibly, proud of the land and respectful of nature. It’s something the world is striving for in these modern times and maybe something we can all learn from.","Cacao has become a relatively ubiquitous commodity today, but it once held a far more important role, as a significant part of Mayan and Aztec culture and history. It could even be said that cacao was became one of the most fundamental motifs in helping Mesoamerican’s understand and orient themselves to the world. Cacao iconography was found throughout the region in pre-Columbian times. It is related to numerous themes found on Mesoamerican vessels and other objects. This includes themes such as fertility and sustenance, sacrifice and regeneration, as well as embodiment and transformation (Martin). The current scientific name of cacao, Theobroma cacao, translates to ‘food of the gods’, a modern hint to its historical importance to religion.\nPossibly the most important link that cacao has to religion within Mesoamerican society is the origination story in the Popol Vuh, a history of Mayan origination that was eventually transcribed by a Dominican Friar Francisco Ximénez. The Popol Vuh contains many references to cacao and is commonly translated as ‘the book of the people’, indicating its core connection to the people and through association, the importance of cacao.\nAccording to a version of the story, Huracan and other deities created a heart of the land, and planted a tall tree connecting the sky and the earth. The roots penetrated into the underworld, the trunk was at the surface, and the branches reached up to the heavens. In some versions of this story the tree is even partially depicted as a cacao tree, suggesting that cacao connects the underworld, the earth, and the heavens. A pair of twins who ended up becoming the sun and the moon were conceived when their father spit on their mother’s hand. Their father in fact is frequently depicted as a cacao tree, and the twins journey is made in order to resurrect their father from the underworld. With the sun and the moon created, the deities were then able to successfully create humans from maize. The story shows how Mayans looked to cacao in order to help define their own creation and existence.\nIn addition to helping define their place in the world, cacao was also used to help them clarify their relationship to death. Cacao iconography is frequently seen outside the realm of drinking vessels for celebration or in terms of the origination story of the Maya. Many cacao depictions can be found around burial sites. Trees were planted over newly laid graves as tokens of future resurrection (Martin). We can see depictions of cacao trees on the sarcophagus of Pakal, an important Mayan figure. Saplings emerging from cracks in the ground can be identified as cacao. The growth of cacao here is symbolic or resurrection and the cycle of new life after death. Cacao is an important metaphorical symbol of rebirth in Mayan iconography (Grofe). In similar depictions of cacao trees, they are anthropomorphized to represent ancestors. Looking to the lifecycle of cacao, Mayans were able to project meaning into their own death, with cacao used as a primary motif in this understanding.\nCacao became an integral part of Mayan religion through the way it could orient the people to the world around them. In itself, cacao is not inherently significant, but as a result of its importance in use and ubiquity in Mayan culture, cacao was an easy motif to use in their history and understanding of the world. It became a way for them to look at how they came into existence as well as begin to understand the role of death and new life. As a result of this role, cacao became an important motif in the iconography of Mesoamerica.\nGrofe, Michael J. “The Recipe for Rebirth: Cacao as Fish in the Mythology and Symbolism of the Ancient Maya.” Famsi.org, 2007, http://www.famsi.org/research/grofe/GrofeRecipeForRebirth.pdf.\nCoe, Sophie D. and Michael D.

{"question":"With wet field conditions in late spring, what are the recommended planting practices for soybeans?","answer":"When fields are too wet for tillage but dry enough on top, direct planting can be considered instead of waiting for field cultivation, especially before upcoming storms. Due to warm soils and rain forecasts, seeds can be planted shallow, ensuring all seeds are covered. Since weed control can be more challenging with direct seeding, appropriate preemergence herbicides should be applied timely. While tractor speeds may need to be reduced, planting slowly is preferable to not planting at all.","context":["Spring came late to all of Minnesota, but for farmers in Southern Minnesota, it came with too many May showers. This has made #Plant18 an especially tough one for farmers in the region. Many seasoned farmers have reported that this will be the latest start in their long memories.\nIt is natural to feel anxious and frustrated with the weather, but it’s important to know that fields will get planted and yields can still be quite good. For the most part, farmers should proceed as normal when windows of good weather allow.\nHold your current soybean varieties\nAn often-asked question revolves around moving to earlier soybean maturities as planting is delayed. Remember, that soybeans have an incredible ability to respond to short seasons by hastening maturity. A shortened seed-filling period is often offset for yield by a longer vegetative period that leads to larger plants. On the other hand, moving to too short of a soybean certainly leads to reduced yields due to a loss of potential yield accrual late in the season.\nTherefore, we do not recommended moving to a shorter maturity soybean until June 10. However, there is a caveat: for producers who selected very long-season varieties for their area with the goal of getting an early start at planting, the switch to shorter lines may need to happen a little earlier.\nHolding existing varieties will allow producers to utilize the full season to maximize soybean yields. Additionally, farmers should assume that they have chosen the absolute highest-yielding soybean genetics for their farm that is available. Switching soybean seed will inevitably result in a trade-down. A lower yield potential is a guarantee.\nAgFax Weed Solutions\nYield potential is still high\nYield potentials are maximized in Minnesota when soybeans can be planted soon after May 1. However, significant reductions in yields are not noted until mid-May. By the last couple of weeks of May, yields are reduced by less than ½ bushel per acre per day. But by June 1, yield losses accelerate and potentials are reduced by more than ½ bushel per acre per day. It’s not too late to plant soybeans, but this is a good time to get it done.\nSo, what should producers do when they are under the pressure of the calendar and the weatherman? In general, producers should follow their same best management practices used when planting early. Good management practices in early May are the same as good management practices in late May.\nHowever, with warmer soils and rain in the forecast, there are some things that some producers could take advantage of. Some fields may be too wet for tillage, but yet are dry enough on top to plant. These may be good candidates for direct planting. If field cultivating will delay you, consider directly planting before the next round of storms. Tractor speeds may be reduced, but planting slow may be better than not planting at all.\nWith warm soils and rain in the forecast, seed can be planted shallow. Just be sure that all of the seed is being covered. Weed control can be more challenging with direct seeding, so appropriate preemergence herbicides should be used in a timely manner.\nGood luck to all of those out there battling to beat the rains. Just remember, those beans will be popping out of the ground in a few days. Your efforts will soon be visible to all."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ecf960ef-5e49-425a-a418-a5bf98313f1c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does academic support in high schools address both classroom learning and online safety challenges?","answer":"High schools provide academic support through multiple channels: teachers are available for individual help before and after school, peer tutoring systems exist, and advisory groups regularly monitor students' academic, social, and emotional well-being. Schools also have specific protocols for helping struggling students and may offer homework support after school. Regarding online safety challenges, schools should have established cyberbullying policies and response procedures. Research indicates 20-30% of students experience cyberbullying, making it crucial for schools to have support systems in place. Schools should be prepared to take immediate action against cyberbullying incidents, with staff like vice principals managing disciplinary measures and counselors or social workers providing emotional support to affected students.","context":["Whether your teen is moving up from a feeder school, you are moving areas or your child is making the transition to a new school, you probably have many questions. What are your options? How much choice do you really have? What's the best option for your child and your family? Where should you begin? Here are some questions to consider:\nDoes the school fit your child?\nLook at the school from your teenager's perspective. A school and its location should feel comfortable for your child, as well as the commute times and transportation. Note the school’s start and end times, average and maximum class size, and overall school size. As they spend more time away from home, even details like clean bathrooms and healthy lunch options can be important to your child's well-being. Think about how well the school’s academic approach matches your child's learning style.\nUnlike when you were choosing a Primary School, you need ask your teenager for his or her input. Your teen is more likely to succeed at a school he or she helped choose. Are his friends going there? Is that important to him? Your teen is going to spend a few years there, make sure he will feel good about it.\nHow many hours of daily homework?\nHigh school students should have homework, but the quantity and quality can vary widely. Homework should include plenty of essays and reading analysis in the humanities. Decide whether your child will thrive or at least manage the expected workload. If your child is an athlete, find out if it is possible to play on a sports team and still complete the expected homework. Ask whether homework is a given over weekends, breaks, and holidays. Finally, find out if there is any after-school homework support.\nWhat electives, sports and service opportunities are available?\nBe sure that the school offers your child’s favorite sport or activity, such as art, music, or drama. What are the requirements for playing on a team?\nWhat support will they offer your child?\nAsk what academic and social support the school offers. Are teachers available for individual help before and after school, or during breaks? Find out if there is a tutoring system that provides students with academic help from other students. Ask what the school does when a student is struggling or failing a class. Advisory groups are a common way schools regularly check in with students to assure they are thriving academically, socially, and emotionally. Finally, find out if there are therapists or social workers available for emotional and social support.\nWill your child be safe there?\nSafety is huge. Find out what the school’s disciplinary policy is and how many suspensions and expulsions they have had over the past two years. Observe the corridors during the school day to see how calm and safe they appear. Inquire whether the school has an open-campus policy, meaning students can leave the school grounds during school hours for lunch, and possibly at other times. Does the school have a written bully policy (and even staff training program)? Finally, don't hesitate to ask if there is an alcohol or drug problem. While this can be an uncomfortable question to ask, it's vital to get a sense of how the school responds to this reality at some high schools, and whether or not they are aware and pro-active.\nWhat is your academic record and do you produce university graduates?\nFirst, ask how many high school students graduate (and what their yearly drop-out rate is), and how many graduates continue on to university. Most schools will provide a list. This information will help you determine how serious the school is about its academic programme and whether graduates get into prestigious schools.","Cyberbullying is using information and communication technologies to deliberately and repeatedly behave in a manner intended to harass, threaten, humiliate or harm others. Part of what makes cyberbullying especially damaging is the ability of an abuser to attack at any hour of the day or night, in any place, and to make their attacks very public. Research suggests that between 20 – 30% of students will experience cyberbullying and between 10 – 20% of students will be a cyberbully at some point.\nVictims of cyberbullying are in a vulnerable state, so how you respond to your child, and how you report the incident(s) to your child’s school, are likely to be significant factors in either making the problem stop, or worsening the situation.\nYour first task is to listen to your child without judgment, blame, or attempting to jump in and ’solve’ it. Gently ask questions to discover how long the cyberbullying has been going on, the names of those involved (if known), and the forms of cyberbullying used. If there is evidence of the cyberbullying – saved text messages, posts, websites, etc. – have your child show these to you and save these for documentation should it be needed.\nYou also need to ask your child to be entirely honest with you about any forms of retaliation they make have taken. Hopefully they have done nothing to retaliate, but often kids and teens lash out and this significantly complicates matters. Let them know that the truth will come out when their cyberbully is confronted, and they will be in far worse shape if they haven’t been transparent about their own behavior. If there is evidence of their actions, document these as well.\nIf your child did not come to you right away, do not place blame, just let them know you are grateful they’ve come to you now. There are many reasons that youth suffer silently, they may be afraid you’ll react by restricting their online access, they may be embarrassed that they can’t take care of the bullying themselves, they may be afraid that you’ll handle things in a way that escalates the bullying, or that you won’t understand and minimize the problem.\nYou may also learn about the cyberbullying from another source, or suspect that cyberbullying is behind behavioral changes you see in your child. In either of these cases, find time when you can be alone and unrushed with your child to bring up the topic.\nAcknowledge your child’s pain. Recognizing your child’s pain and hearing you affirm that what happened wasn’t fair or right is important validation. Being cyberbullied is alienating enough; do nothing that makes your child feel any more isolated. Bullying hurts and that hurt is exhibited many forms — anger, embarrassment, betrayal, frustration, confusion, fear, and reprisal.\nReactions may also differ depending on who is doing the bullying, how pervasive it is, who witnessed it, what the nature of the bullying was, if bystanders lent support or not, and so on. Help them see that bullies’ actions are not a result of a fault within your child, but a fault within the bully.\nIf your child or teen retaliated with their own cyberbullying, you also need to include a full discussion about the inappropriateness of their behavior and what the consequences will be. The assertion that “the other kid started it” is irrelevant. Your child cannot blame their choices and behavior on anyone else, and must be held accountable. If they want justice for what was done to them, they need to expect the same yardstick to be applied to any cyberbullying they committed.\nOnce you understand the scope of the problem, and how your child feels, assess what help your child may need.\nHelp your child take preventative measures online to block cyberbullies from contacting them, and report cyberbullies to the service providers where the cyberbullying occurred. Responsible sites should take immediate action against cyberbullying incidents.\nIf your son or daughter experienced cyberbullying, chances are high that the negative fallout has spilled over into their school experience – whether or not the cyberbullying actually occurred while your child or their abuser(s) were on school grounds.\nTake immediate steps to address the issue. Don’t wait to see if the cyberbullying goes away. Your child needs to know that you can and will help them with this problem. Ideally you are already informed of your child’s school’s cyberbullying policy. However, it’s more likely you have a vague idea there is such a policy and little to no idea if the policy actually helps protect victims or risks exposing your child to greater bullying.\nStart by contacting the school’s vice principal, or whomever is in charge of disciplinary measures, and ask what steps are taken when cyberbullying is reported, how well other victims have been protected, and what steps are taken to ensure the cyberbullying doesn’t escalate.\nSchool staff should be very open and supportive in their answers and you should feel free to ask the questions you need in order to feel comfortable about reporting the incident, and assured that you know what to expect every step of the way. If your questions aren’t met with open understanding, or you believe the school will not handle the issue well, step back and reconsider your options. The last thing a cyberbullying victim needs is for the problem to get worse.\nNext, discuss what you learned from the school with your child or teen and chart out the best course of action. Cyberbullying robs victims of their sense of control; by including your child in the process of resolving the issue you help them regain that control.\nIf your child is guilty of retaliation cyberbullying be particularly mindful as you weigh your course of action. Many schools have a zero cyberbullying tolerance and both bullies – the instigator and your child the responder – may be in for the same punishment. Schools may also be obligated to report cyberbullying acts that step over the boundary of the law.\nIf reporting the incident to the school is the best course of action, you can now move forward in reporting and documenting the incident(s) following the guidelines you received from the school in your previous conversation.\nSimultaneously, you may want to help your child or teen increase the strength of their friendships to reduce the feeling of isolation victims often experience. Depending on how deeply the cyberbullying has impacted your child, you may also choose to set up appointments with the school’s counselor or ask the school’s counselor for names of therapists who have expertise in working through the effects of the cyberbullying.\nCyberbullying may also be criminal. Physical threats of harm should be reported to police immediately. Laws vary by state, but cyberbullies may be guilty of cyberstalking, computer trespassing, and other crimes. If the situation warrants it, contact your local law enforcement."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0a390fa1-c4c2-46af-b79a-604b9d18b49a>","<urn:uuid:5a25a96d-3f97-4121-876d-4155c37ef483>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did early Islamic Umayyad rulers use Qasr Amra palace?","answer":"The Umayyad princes used Qasr Amra as a desert palace, abandoning traditional Arab Bedouin tents for palace living. The palace consisted primarily of an audience hall and bathing rooms (hamams). The main hall was decorated with frescoes depicting hunting parties, women, and 8th-century AD aristocrats paying homage to the Umayyads. The palace also featured astronomical and astrological designs decorating a dome in a hamam.","context":["Jordan beyond Petra\n“It seems no work of Man’s creative hand, by labour wrought as wavering fancy planned; But from the rock as if by magic grown, eternal, silent, beautiful, alone! Not virgin-white like that old Doric shrine, where erst Athena held her rites divine; Not saintly-grey, like many a minster fane, that crowns the hill and consecrates the plain; But rose-red as if the blush of dawn, that first beheld them were not yet withdrawn; The hues of youth upon a brow of woe, which Man deemed old two thousand years ago, Match me such marvel save in Eastern clime, a rose-red city half as old as time” ~ Petra by John William Burgon 1845\nThis famous poem won Burgon Oxford University’s prestigious Newdigate Prize for Poetry in 1845. Extraordinarily, Burgon had never seen Petra, but like so many, was entranced by the illustrations that circulated Europe after Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt reintroduced the city to western consciousness. Yet modern Jordan is so much more than Petra, occupying lands that have been inhabited as long as humans have lived out of Africa. (Indeed, even Petra still has surprises to offer: recent archaeological work has revealed one of the earliest agricultural communities in the world at Beidha – dating back 13,000 years, to a time before pottery and the wheel.)\nSuch a density of human occupation, over such an impressive span of time, has endowed Jordan with spectacular architecture from all the civilisations of the Middle East that flourished during the last two and half millennia.\nIn the north of Jordan sit the beautiful ruins of great Jerash. Originally a city founded by Seleucid Hellenistic Kings, successors to Alexander the Great, Jerash was incorporated into an expanding Roman Empire alongside nine Greek-speaking cities of the “Decapolis”, forming a buffer zone between Roman dominions, the Nabataean Arab kingdom to the south (including Petra), and Sassanian Persians to the east. Trajan’s conquest in the 2nd century AD subjugated all the Greek-speaking cities of the Middle East, a rebellious Jewish Kingdom, and the wealthy mercantile Nabataean state, with Jerash appointed capital of the phenomenally wealthy Roman province of Syria.\nThe prosperity of Jerash developed from international trade based on exploitation of the local agricultural base and from her status as a centre of Imperial Roman government. Emperor Hadrian resided in Jerash for a period and much construction was undertaken during his reign. Unlike Syrian Palmyra, or Petra, Jerash did not preserve her pre-Roman character – the city plan is exclusively Roman, making Jerash one of the finest extant examples of Roman urban planning. The city boasts a triumphal arch dedicated to Hadrian’s visit in 129/130 AD, a large hippodrome, colonnaded cardo (main street), an almost unique colonnaded oval forum and grand temples dedicated to Zeus and Artemis.\nJordan is also rightly famous for her connections to early Christianity – for centuries pilgrims have been travelling to be baptised in the (now gruesomely polluted) waters of the river for which the country is named. The conversion of the Greek- speaking eastern Roman empire to Christianity during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, led to the commemoration with monasteries and churches of many sites associated with the Bible by staunchly Christian Byzantines.\nPerhaps the most extraordinary of these early Christian sites are the churches and monasteries of Madaba and Mount Nebo – reputedly the birthplace of Mary Magdelene and the spot from which Moses gazed upon the Holy Land. During the 20th century AD, Roman and Byzantine churches were unearthed, all of which were brightly decorated with fabulous mosaics. These churches often incorporate the architecture of earlier Roman palatial structures and one of these, the Hippolytus Hall, includes the vestibule of the Church of the Virgin, built above the hall of a 6th-century AD Madaba mansion. The most famous mosaic covers the floor of the Greek Orthodox Church of St George with an extraordinary 6th-century AD map of Palestine, depicting the holy city of Jerusalem at its centre. Comprising two million individual pieces of brightly-coloured local stone, the mosaic depicts hills and valleys, villages and towns, as far away as the Nile Delta. Behind Madaba rises Mount Nebo, with commanding views over the Dead Sea, Palestine and Israel. Mount Nebo is also known as Jabal Musa or ‘Moses’ Mountain’, because according to legend God granted Moses his dying wish to see the Promised Land by transporting him to the summit of Mount Nebo. In commemoration of this legend, a 4th-century AD chapel was erected at Sygha on Mount Nebo’s highest crest, further extended during the 6th century AD. A later Byzantine monastery was constructed around the chapel and decorated with a series of detailed mosaic floors, including a vine of life and a cornucopia of animals.\nAs the Byzantines incorporated the architecture and culture of the pre-Christian Roman world, so the first Islamic dynasty of the Ummayads absorbed the heritage of the Greek- speaking Christian world. The power of this Islamic empire was initially based on the wealth of the predominately Christian and Greek- speaking cities of modern Syria and Jordan, propelling the armies of the Caliphate as far west as the shores of the Atlantic and as far east as the banks of the Indus. The great Ummayad princes took to the life of the Byzantine aristocrat with aplomb, abandoning Arab Bedouin tents for palace living. One of the finest examples of these desert palaces is at Qasr Amra, a small and enigmatic foundation consisting primarily of an audience hall and a series of hamams, or bathing rooms. Qasr Amra’s main hall is decorated with startling frescoes of hunting parties, women, and 8th-century AD aristocrats paying homage to the Umayyads, while astronomical and astrological designs decorate a dome in a hamam. Another Ummayad palace at Qasr Azraq was reconstructed in the 13th century AD by the Ayyubid dynasty from stark, black basalt, to dominate the local oasis. This fortress was probably begun during the 2nd century BC by the Romans, reconstructed by the Ummayads as a desert palace, reconfigured by the Ayyubids and finally – and extraordinarily – used by T.E. Lawrence as his base of operations during the winter of 1917-18.\nThe Ayyubids, who reconstructed Qasr Azraq in the 13th century AD, are probably best known in the west for the founder of their dynasty: Salah ad-Din al-Ayyubi, or Saladin. He and his descendants constructed fortifications across the landscape of modern Jordan to prevent the predations of Christian crusaders. These Crusaders also left a substantial legacy, with the castle at Karak perhaps finest of all. Initially constructed by Pagan, the butler of Fulk of Jerusalem, during the 1140s AD to protect the eastern flanks of the Christian Kingdom of Outremer, Crac de Moabites (Karak in Moab) is one of the largest of all the crusader castles in the Middle East, rivaling Crac de Chevalier in Syria in size and completeness. Karak dominates the surrounding landscape and was expanded through the 12th and 13th centuries by local crusader ‘Lords of Oultrejordain’ (Lords of Transjordan.) Besieged by Saladin after the Battle of Hattin in 1187 AD, the castle held out for two long years before falling in 1189 AD. Further expanded by Mamluk Sultans in the 13th century BC, it was only during the 19th century that Karak finally lost its position as the dominant fortification in the region.\nThese few examples will hopefully give the reader a sense of the breadth and depth of history to be found within the borders of modern Jordan – a land with a deep past and bright future, beyond Petra."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d2e37ac0-0f0f-48bb-8571-e149f26642f0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the defensive mechanisms of the Common Lionfish and Sea Goblin differ when encountering threats?","answer":"The Common Lionfish and Sea Goblin have different defensive responses to threats. When disturbed by a diver, the Common Lionfish typically remains in place and points its 13 venomous dorsal fin spines toward the intruder. In contrast, the Sea Goblin flashes the undersides of its pectoral fins as a warning signal when disturbed, and relies heavily on its natural camouflage to discourage predators. Both species possess venomous spines, with the Common Lionfish having venomous dorsal, pelvic, and anal fin spines, while the Sea Goblin has 15-17 venomous dorsal spines.","context":["Animal Species:Common Lionfish, Pterois volitans (Linnaeus, 1758)\nThe Common Lionfish is a spectacular looking fish that has 13 venemous dorsal fin spines.\nStandard Common Name\nButterfly Cod, Featherfins, Fire Fish, Lionfish, Red Firefish, Scorpion-cod, Turkeyfish, Zebrafish\nThe Common Lionfish has very long pectoral and dorsal fins. The body is covered with red to black bands on a pale background. Adults often have white spots along the lateral line. A tentacle is usually present above both eyes. The tentacle is variable in size and shape, usually long in juveniles and leaf-like in adults.\nThe species looks very similar to the Spotfin Lionfish, Pterois antennata, which has a similar distribution in Australia. The two species can be distinguished by the shape and colour of the pectoral fins. The fins of P. volitans are more pointed and covered with variable spots and bands, while P. antennata has more rounded fins which are white to gold in colour.\nOther differences include the pectoral ray count, which is 14-16 in P. volitans and 16-17 in P. antennata. The scales of P. volitans are cycloid but in P. antennata they are mostly ctenoid. The lateral scale rows number 90-120 in P. volitans and 50-54 in P. antennata.\nThe species grows to 38 cm in length.\nSpotfin Lionfish, Pterois antennata (see Identification)\nIt is a tropical species found widely throughout the Indo-Pacific. In Australia it is known from south-western Western Australia, around the tropical north of the country and south to the southern coast of New South Wales.\nIt is now a pest species in parts of the Western Atlantic and Caribbean.\nThe map below shows the Australian distribution of the species based on public sightings and specimens in Australian Museums. Source: Atlas of Living Australia.\nDistribution by collection data\nDanger to humans and first aid\nThe species has extremely venomous fin spines. All 13 dorsal fin spines, 1 pelvic fin spine and 3 anal fin spines are venomous. The pectoral and caudal fins are not toxic because they lack spines. When disturbed by a diver, the Common Lionfish often makes little effort to swim away. Instead it points its dorsal fin spines towards the intruder.\n- Hoese, D.F., Bray, D.J., Paxton, J.R. & G.R.

Known by several other names (Spiny Devilfish, Demon Stinger), this fish is a member of the scorpionfish family (Scorpaenidae) though sometimes it is placed in the stonefish family (Synancejidae) It is a superbly camouflaged bottom dweller commonly found around Koh Tao, especially at Japanese Gardens, Twins, and Lighthouse.\nSea Goblins have elongate bodies without scales, with the exception of 13-15 buried in the lateral line. They are covered with skin glands that have the appearance of warts. They seem to range approximately between 130 mm to 200 mm in length. Being bottom dwellers, Sea Goblins display a number of benthic predatory specializations.\nThe species has a depressed head that is strongly concave on the dorsal side. The head is also covered with flaps of skin and raised ridges, and tentacles are present on the head, trunk, and fins. Its mouth points up almost vertically, and its eyes protrude visibly outwards. A raised knob at the end of its snout gives it the appearance of having an upturned nose. All these make it extremely easy for the fish to catch its prey.\nThe pectoral fins are large and their coloration is significant in identifying the different species of Inimicus. In I. didactylus, the underside of the pectoral fins bears broad dark bands (containing smaller, lighter spots) at the basal and distal ends. The lower 2 rays of its pectoral fins are free from the rest of the fin and used in “walking” along the bottom. I. didactylus is able to slowly crawl or drag itself along the seafloor. When not in motion, they spend most of their life buried in mud or concealed in coral reefs.\nThe Sea Goblin is mainly piscivorous. It lies partially buried in the seafloor with its eyes protruding above the substrate waiting to ambush smaller fishes. Its natural coloration allows it to blend in seamlessly with its environment, making it more difficult for its prey to visually spot it. If threatened, this species also flashes the undersides of its pectoral fins when disturbed as a warning signal. These, in addition to its natural camouflage, discourage other organisms from feeding on it.\nThe dorsal fin is composed of 15 to 17 venomous spines and 7 to 9 rays. Like other members of the scorpionfish family, I. didactylus possesses powerful venom that is stored in glands at the bases of its dorsal spines that can be injected upon contact. Because it is so well concealed, swimmers or divers may accidentally brush against it. It is also commonly caught by prawn trawlers. With a basic amount of care, observing these fish as they are slowly relocating from one hunting ground to the next can be an amazing experience. The key to finding them is landing in the sand, and remaining motionless for a few minutes. After the fish habituate to the diver’s presence, they will start moving about in slow, rhythmic motion usually matching the motion of the waves if in a shallow location."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:80576639-9a65-4c27-b053-56c8f60832d6>","<urn:uuid:b2a42083-8b61-4f09-8ef8-f5943a1a638e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the benefits of sports variation in young athletes, and what injury risks do they face from early specialization?","answer":"Sports variation in young athletes leads to better physical development, higher success rates, and enhanced motivation. Research shows that early diversification is more likely to lead to success than intense single-sport training. Athletes who participate in various sports develop multiple physical qualities simultaneously and become more robust individuals. However, young athletes who specialize early face significant injury risks. They are at greater risk of overuse injuries due to repetitive movements and stress on specific tissues. Because young athletes are still growing, they are particularly vulnerable to growth plate injuries, which can impair normal bone development. Additionally, early specialization can lead to psychological issues like burnout, depression, and anxiety, often resulting in increased dropout rates.","context":["The Benefits of Sports Variation\nThere is a common line of thought suggesting that to become great at something, you need to focus on that single thing and dedicate as much time to it as humanly possible. For the most part, this does hold some truth to it.\nTo become the best in the world at a given sport, you do need to practice that specific sport a hell of a lot.\nThis is quite obvious, and really, it makes a whole lot of sense.\nHowever, for us as humans, this specialization may also be to our determinant.\nIn fact, there is a reason to believe that actively participating in different sports may be much more beneficial for health. Additionally, it could benefit physical development and musculoskeletal capacity more than simply sticking to the single sport indefinitely.\nWhat is Sports Specialization?\nWe could simply define sports specialization as the intense, year-round training of a single sport, in conjunction with the exclusion of other sports (Malina, 2010).\nWhile variations on this general definition do certainly exist, they all have a very clear thing in common. They indicate that a person sacrifices the potential performance of other sports to focus all their energy and effort into one.\nThis may undoubtedly have merit in adult athletes who aim to reach the top level of their chosen sport. However, there is research to suggest that it may actually have some rather negative effects in certain populations.\nRelated Article: Developing & Maintaining Athleticism\nEarly Sports Specialization\nWhen researching sports specialization, the most common group discussed is children and youth athletes. This is often in conjunction with the term early sports specialization.\nAs previously discussed, there is a general agreement that the number of hours spent deliberately training for a particular sport will positively correlate with the level of achievement in that sport. It is a concept that stems from early research on musicians.\nThis particular research found that those musicians who had spent over 10,000 hours practicing their instrument of choice were almost always more successful. This is especially when compared to their peers who had accumulated 7000 hours or less.\nMoreover, this same research showed that those musicians who began their training at around 5 years of age were much more likely to become more successful than those who started later in life.\nEssentially, those who began after age 5 were unable to catch up.\nHowever, research in athletes has not shown the same association.\nIn fact, research has consistently demonstrated that early intense training is not essential for achieving elite levels of performance in all sports. Rather, for most sports, early diversification and sports variation is much more likely to lead to success (Jayanthi, 2013).\nAlternatively, in this scenario, early sports variation has some rather significant downfalls.\nWhat Are the Negatives Associated With Early Sports Specialization?\nYoung athletes who specialize early have been shown to be at a significantly greater risk of injury than those individuals who perform a variety of sports. This is irrespective of whether the total training volume between the two groups is the same (Jayanthi, 2015).\nWhile we cannot be one hundred percent sure as to the reason for this finding, it is likely two-fold.\nFirstly, those athletes who specialize in a single sport will undoubtedly find themselves repeating the same movements over and over again. This repetition can easily overload specific tissues of the body, leading to an increased risk of injury.\nConversely, those athletes who diversify do not get this same repetitive tissue strain.\nSecondly, those athletes who participate in a variety of different sports get the opportunity to develop several physical qualities simultaneously. As a result, they have the capacity to become a more robust individual, in which they can more effectively handle the physical demands placed upon them in unexpected sporting scenarios.\nAlternatively, while those who specialize may become extremely competent at the specific skills involved in their chosen sport, their physical capacity remains very narrow. In other words, they can only handle the physical demands placed on them within a specific sporting context.\nAs a result, they are less equipped to handle the unexpected physical demands that may arise in open competition, thus increasing their risk of acute injury.\nIn conjunction with the physical impact of early specialization, it has also been suggested to have associated psychological implications (Myer, 2015).\nYou see, there are increased pressures associated with intense, specialized, training and competitions. This has been shown to significantly increase the risk of developing burnout, depression, and anxiety.\nAdditionally, research on young athletes has shown that professionalized, adult-style practices can actually inhibit talent development pathways.\nSpecifically, it has been shown that children and adolescents need to enjoy the activities of their domain to ensure intrinsic motivation. Without enjoyment, there is no desire to maintain participation or achieve goals.\nAs a result, increased rates of physical inactivity and drop out are increasingly common in children who specialize too early (Wall, 2007).\nWhat is Sports Variation?\nOn the flip side, we have sports variation.\nAs its name suggests, sports variation (also known as sports diversification) essentially describes the process of actively performing more than one sport across the year’s duration.\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean trying to become the best in the world at several different activities. Rather you should partake in a number of sports that require different skill sets. As a result, this variation ensures the development of several physical characteristics simultaneously, whilst also keeping enjoyment levels high across the year.\nWith all this in mind, it essentially eliminates the negative effects of early specialization. If your child does look to have a career in elite sport, they shouldn’t really begin to specialize until they get closer to college.\nBut how does this affect us as adults?\nWhat Are The Benefits of Sports Variation in Adults?\nAs adults, we have a tendency to gravitate towards those activities that we enjoy – which makes sense. If we are training for the sole purpose of maintaining a fit and healthy lifestyle, then why not do things that we find fun?\nThis is likely to improve adherence, motivation, and therefore effectiveness.\nHowever, it does again have some pitfalls.\nMuch like in the scenario of early specialization outlined above, limiting yourself to strictly performing one specific task for years on end greatly increase your chance of developing an overuse injury.\nSimilarly, it can also limit the development of numerous physical qualities.\nWhile this doesn’t sound all that bad, it is important to note that to maintain a high quality of life throughout the duration of your lifetime, you need to maintain the physical capacity to navigate through life effectively (Rennemark, 2009).\nThis means you need to have adequate strength, power, and reaction time. Additionally, you have the ability to respond to unexpected situations effectively. They are all skills that come with actively choosing to diversify the sports that you play, either in a competitive or social setting.\nNot to mention that fact that performing team sports in more social environments have been shown to have a myriad of mental health benefits. Health benefits include increased self-esteem, lower risks of depression and anxiety, and even heightened life satisfaction (Eime, 2013).\nIn short, sports variety can have a huge impact on your life.\nRelated Article: The Best Workout Combination: Endurance Training and HIIT\nHow Should I Train for Sports variety?\nSo, we know that participating in different sports can have an immensely positive impact on both the physical and psychological aspects of your life. But most of us also realize that there is some risk associated with performing a sport we are not accustomed too.\nNamely, the risk of injury, and of course, the chance of being somewhat average at it (which obviously improves through participation).\nBut this risk can be mitigated by ensuring that you are adequately prepared for any sport in a completely physical sense. This is done by dedicating your own training to developing the most important physical qualities that underpin all sport.\nSpecifically, aerobic capacity, muscle strength, muscle power, and landing ability.\nBy ensuring that you train each of these qualities in a gym environment, you can be certain that you are at the very least prepared for the physical demands of any sport. It will not only improve your performance capabilities but also lowering your risk of injury.\nThe Best Sports Variety Gym Program\nTaking the above into consideration, I have put together a simple gym program that can be performed 2-3 times per week. This program targets the fours key qualities outlined above, ensuring that you are well prepared for literally any sport.\nIn conclusion, sports variety is so much more than just playing different sports. It provides the opportunity to develop the broad foundation of physical capacity required to navigate daily life effectively.\nIn children, this can lead to seriously improved outcomes in sporting scenarios and improvement in health. Similarly, in adults, it can lead to better functional capacity, psychological health, and even greater quality of life.\nIt truly is one of the most enjoyable ways to boost health and function on the planet.\nMalina, Robert M. “Early sports specialization: roots, effectiveness, risks.” Current sports medicine reports 9.6 (2010): 364-371.\nJayanthi, Neeru, et al. “Sports specialization in young athletes: evidence-based recommendations.” Sports Health 5.3 (2013): 251-257.\nJayanthi, Neeru A., et al. “Sports-specialized intensive training and the risk of injury in young athletes: a clinical case-control study.”.

For example, overhand pitching in baseball can be associated with injuries to the elbow, and swimming is often associated with injuries to the shoulder.\nBecause young athletes are still growing, they are at a greater risk for injury than adults. The consequences of overdoing a sport can include injuries that impair growth, and may lead to long-term health problems.\nWhen a young athlete repeatedly complains of pain, a period of rest from the sport is necessary. If pain persists, it is important to seek proper medical treatment. To ensure the best possible recovery, athletes, coaches, and parents must follow safe guidelines for returning to the game.\nOveruse injuries occur in a wide range of sports, from baseball and basketball to track, soccer, and gymnastics. Some of these injuries are unique to a certain sport, such as throwing injuries of the elbow and shoulder that are prevalent in baseball players. The most common overuse injuries involve the knee and foot.\nOveruse injuries can affect muscles, ligaments, tendons, bones, and growth plates. In children, these structures are still growing, and the growth is generally uneven. Bones grow first, which pulls at tight muscles and tendons. This uneven growth pattern makes younger athletes more susceptible to muscle, tendon, and growth plate injuries.\nGrowth plates are the areas of developing cartilage where bone growth occurs in children. The growth plates are weaker than the nearby ligaments and tendons. Repetitive stress can lead to injury of the growth plate and disrupt the normal growth of the bone.\nAs organized youth athletics has grown in popularity, the pressure to compete has led to children specializing in one sport only. In generations past, children changed sports with the seasons throughout the year, but today it is common for a child to play just one sport year-round. Many children play on more than one team at the same time, as well.\nWhen a child participates in just one sport throughout the year, he or she continually uses the same muscle groups and applies unchanging stress to specific areas of the body. This can lead to muscle imbalances that, when combined with overtraining and inadequate periods of rest, put children at serious risk for overuse injuries.\nCoaches and parents should be aware of the more common signs of overuse injury. These include:\n- Pain. This pain cannot be tied to an acute injury, such as from a fall. The pain often increases with activity\n- Changes in form or technique\n- Decreased interest in practice\nCommon Overuse Injuries in Children\nSever’s disease is one of most common causes of heel pain in children, and often occurs during adolescence when children hit a growth spurt. Also known as an osteochondrosis or apophysitis, Sever’s disease is an inflammatory condition of the growth plate in the heel bone (calcaneus). Running, jumping, and being active lead to repetitive stress on the growth plate as the foot strikes the ground. This results in inflammation (swelling) in the growth plate which causes heel pain.\nThe primary treatment of Sever’s disease is to rest the foot (stop the sport) until the pain goes away. Once the pain is gone, the child may return to normal activities.\nAdditional treatments may include:\n- Heel pads. Heel cushions inserted in sports shoes can help absorb impact and relieve stress on the heel and ankle.\n- Stretching exercises. Stretches for the Achilles tendon (heel cord) can reduce stress on the heel.\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen reduce pain and swelling.\nIn cases where the pain is bad enough to interfere with walking, a short-leg cast or “walker boot” might be required to immobilize the foot while it heals.\nIt is not unusual for Sever’s disease to recur. This typically happens when a child increases sports activities. Wearing sports shoes that provide good support to the foot and heel may help prevent recurrence. Sever’s disease will not return once a child is fully grown and the growth plate in the heel has hardened into bone.\nIn Osgood-Schlatter disease, children have pain at the front of the knee due to inflammation of the growth plate at the upper end of the tibia (shinbone). This growth plate (known as the tibial tubercle) is a bump near the top of the tibia where the tendon from the kneecap (patellar tendon) attaches to the bone.\nWhen a child is active, the quadriceps muscles of the thigh pull on the patellar tendon which in turn, pulls on the tibial tubercle. In some children, this repetitive traction on the tubercle leads to inflammation, swelling, and tenderness. The prominence, or bump, of the tibial tubercle may become very pronounced. Painful symptoms are often brought on by running, jumping, and other sports-related activities.\nTreatment of Osgood-Schlatter disease focuses on limiting exercise activity until the pain resolves.\n- Stretching exercises. Stretches for the front and back of the thigh (quadriceps and hamstring muscles) may help relieve pain and prevent the disease from returning.\n- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication. Drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen reduce pain and swelling.\n- Immobilization. If the pain is severe and interferes with walking and normal daily activities, a cast or cast brace may be applied to completely rest the knee area.\nMost symptoms will completely disappear when a child completes the adolescent growth spurt, around age 14 for girls and age 16 for boys. However, the prominence of the tubercle will persist.\nUntil a child is fully grown, however, Osgood-Schlatter disease can lead to more severe problems if it is not allowed to heal. Continued stress on the tibial tubercle from athletic activity could potentially lead to a break in the tubercle bone. Treatment for this type of fracture will require casting or even surgery. In order for the fracture to safely heal, a child will not be allowed to participate in sports for a prolonged period of time.\nJumper’s knee refers to pain that occurs in the lower portion of the kneecap (patella). These painful symptoms can range from mild to severe.\nRepetitive contraction of the quadriceps muscles in the thigh can stress the patellar tendon where it attaches to the kneecap, causing inflammation and tissue damage (this condition is also known as patellar tendinitis).\nIn growing children, the patellar tendon attaches to the growth plate of the kneecap, and repetitive stress on the tendon can irritate and injure the growth plate. This condition is referred to as Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease.\nAlthough these types of problems in the kneecap commonly occur in children who are active in sports that involve jumping — such as basketball and volleyball — they can be seen in almost any sport.\nWhether the problem stems from the tendon or growth plate, a child will need to rest from sports activities until the pain resolves.\nIn addition to rest, your doctor may recommend applying an ice pack to the knee every 2 to 3 hours for a few days until the pain starts to go away. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications may also help to relieve painful symptoms.\nLike Osgood-Schlatter disease, Jumper’s knee can result in a fracture if a child continues to participate in sports activity without adequate rest. A fracture at the lower end of the kneecap will require treatment with casting or surgery, depending upon the type of fracture. The recovery time for a fracture of the patella requires prolonged absence from sports.\nThrowing Injuries in the Elbow\nA child’s elbow can be injured from repetitive overhand throwing, as seen with pitching in baseball. Although throwing injuries in the elbow most commonly occur in pitchers, they can be seen in any child who participates in repetitive overhand throwing.\nThe overhand throw creates stresses on the growth areas of the immature elbow. If overdone, overhand throwing may result in excessive inflammation of structures in the elbow, such as ligaments, cartilage, and growth plates.\nMedial apophysitis. One of the most common elbow problems in active children is medial apophysitis, often referred to as “Little Leaguer’s elbow.” Medial apophysitis causes pain at the bony bump on the inside of the elbow. The bump, called the medial epicondyle, is at the end of the humerus bone and contains a growth plate called the medial apophysis. Muscles that control wrist motion attach to the medial epicondyle, and excessive overhand throwing can irritate and inflame the growth plate.\nOsteochondritis dissecans. A common source of pain at the outside of the elbow in active children is osteochondritis dissecans. Excessive overhand throwing can compress the immature bones of the elbow joint, causing small pieces of cartilage and bone to loosen and float inside the joint.\nAs with all overuse injuries, the key to pain relief is resting from the sport. If pain continues after a few days of complete rest, seek medical treatment. If left untreated, throwing injuries in the elbow can become complicated conditions. Depending upon the severity of a child’s injury, surgery may be required.\nStress fractures occur when muscles become fatigued and transfer the overload of stress to bones. Bone is a living tissue and is constantly in a balanced cycle of building up and breaking down. If a child overdoes activity and too much stress is being placed on bones, the body will not be able to build up bone fast enough. Eventually, the bone fails and a small crack (stress fracture) develops.\nThe repetitive force that causes a stress fracture is not great enough to cause an acute fracture — such as a broken arm caused by a fall. Most stress fractures occur in the weightbearing bones of the lower leg and the foot. They often result from a sudden increase in activity, such as when a child begins cross country running after a summer of rest.\nStress fractures typically require 6 to 8 weeks to heal. During that time, the child cannot participate in the activity that caused the injury. A cast or brace may be needed to rest the injured bones while they heal.\nIf the activity that caused the stress fracture is resumed too quickly, larger, harder-to-heal stress fractures can develop. Re-injury also could lead to chronic problems where the stress fracture might never heal properly.\nStress Reaction of Growth Plates (Physis)\nRepetitive stress on a growth plate (physis) in the arms or legs can be painful and, if ignored, can impair growth.\nOveruse stress reaction leads to irregularity or widening of the growth plate. If repetitive stress continues, the growth plate can become permanently damaged and may actually stop growing prematurely. This could lead to a deformity.\nCommon examples of sports activities that may cause stress reaction in growth plates include gymnastics and overhand throwing. Gymnasts perform repetitive wrist activities that can lead to stress reaction of the growth plate in the distal radius bone. Young baseball pitchers apply forces across the upper arm bone in their shoulders during the overhand throw. The growth plate in the upper humerus of the shoulder can be damaged and appear widened in an x-ray image.\nIf the growth plate appears abnormal in an x-ray of a child who participates in a high risk sport, treatment requires stopping the aggravating activity for 2 to 3 months.\nStrains and Sprains\nSoft tissues such as muscles, ligaments, and tendons can be injured from overuse. Just about every sports activity can be associated with this.\nA period of rest from the sport and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine will typically relieve pain associated with strains and sprains. Physical therapy exercises may be recommended to help restore strength and mobility.\nMany overuse injuries in children can be prevented. Key to prevention is to avoid overdoing any single sport, and to give growing bodies adequate rest between practices or games.\nThe American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons has partnered with STOP Sports Injuries to help educate parents, coaches, and athletes about how to prevent overuse injuries. Specific tips to prevent overuse injuries include:\n- Limit the number of teams in which your child is playing in one season. Kids who play on more than one team are especially at risk for overuse injuries.\n- Do not allow your child to play one sport year round — taking regular breaks and playing other sports is essential to skill development and injury prevention."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2ebecfaf-ceb2-4e7a-96f8-9adbc516466a>","<urn:uuid:1df6eca9-a90b-42af-952b-631d4cd31020>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do ancient and modern approaches to environmental adaptation in North America compare?","answer":"Ancient Native peoples adapted to changing forest conditions rather than intensively managing them, thriving by adjusting to environmental changes. In contrast, modern approaches have relied heavily on fire suppression, which has proven costly and counterproductive, leading to massive wildfires. This situation is being further complicated by climate change, leading some modern scientists and policy makers to now turn to indigenous knowledge and management practices as a potential solution for both adaptation and reducing emissions.","context":["BINGHAMTON, N.Y. - Contrary to long-held beliefs, humans did not make major changes to the landscape prior to European colonization, according to new research conducted in New England featuring faculty at Binghamton University, State University of New York. These new insights into the past could help to inform how landscapes are managed in the future.\nA theory that Native Americans actively managed landscapes, using fire to clear forests, has been growing in popularity in recent decades. Binghamton archaeologist Elizabeth Chilton and fellow researchers at Emerson College, Harvard University, University of Wyoming and The Public Archeology Laboratory, a New England cultural resource management firm, sought to explore the following key question: Over the past 14,000 years (since the last glaciation) were humans the major drivers of environmental change in southern New England or were they responding to changes in the climate?\n\"The paleo-climate, paleo-ecology and archaeological records suggest that native peoples were not modifying their immediate environments to a great degree,\" said Chilton. \"And they certainly were not doing so with large-scale fire or clear-cutting of trees. The widespread and intensive deforestation and agriculture brought by Europeans in the 17th century was in clear contrast to what had come before. Previous conservation practices had been based on a presumption that Native Americans manipulated their environments using fire, and this research does not support that interpretation.\"\nThe team examined data from multiple sources over the past 14,000 years: pollen records, fire history (from charcoal in lake cores), hydrology and archaeology and combined these data using GIS to look for correlations in changes in the data sets over time. This marked the first time that archaeologists and ecologists worked together to analyze New England land use and climate history on a regional scale and over the entirety of pre-colonial Native American history.\n\"Much to my surprise, we found that, even though we know that Native Americans were in New England for at least 14,000 years with, at certain times in history, fairly large population densities, the ecological signal was essentially invisible,\" said Chilton. \"If one did not know there had been humans on the landscape, it would be almost impossible to detect them on a regional scale. After the arrival of Europeans, large-scale cutting and burning of forests is very clear in the ecological record.\"\nAccording to the researchers, this research provides important lessons for sustainability and contemporary conservation practice.\n\"Today, New England's species and habitat biodiversity is globally unique, and this research transforms our thinking and rationale for the best ways to maintain it. It also points to the importance of historical research to help us interpret modern landscapes and conserve them effectively into the future,\" said lead author Wyatt Oswald from Emerson College.\n\"Ancient native people thrived under changing forest conditions not by intensively managing them but by adapting to them and the changing environment,\" added Chilton.\nThis research was primarily concentrated in coastal New England. The researchers also have data from the interior of New England and are interested in comparing the data sets both within the region and with other regions with comparable data.\nThis research was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation.\nThe paper, \"Conservation implications of limited Native American impacts in pre-contact New England,\" was published in Nature Sustainability.\nBinghamton University offers live or pre-taped interviews powered by a state-of-the-art ReadyCam television studio system, available at a moment's notice.

Karuk management practices have been interrupted by genocide and ongoing presence of non-Native land management practices. In particular the exclusion of fire has led to radical ecological changes including high fuel loads, decreased habitat for large game such as elk and deer, reduction in the quantity and quality of acorns, and alteration of growth patterns of basketry materials such as hazel and willow. Across California the increasing frequency of high severity fire points to the need to re-examine human relationships with fire.\nKaruk People have historically used fire for millennia. While fire can be incredibly dangerous, it is an inevitable part of natural ecosystems, especially in lightning-prone forested areas such as the mid-Klamath. Forested areas in northern California have become adapted to frequent occurrence of relatively low intensity fire from human and natural ignitions for more than the past 1,000 years (Perry et al. 2011, Taylor et al 2016).\nKaruk use of fire has been central to the evolution of the flora and fauna of the mid- Klamath (Anderson 2005, Lake 2007 and 2013, Lake et al. 2010, Skinner et al. 2006).\nThese fire adapted forests burned in smaller overall areas in mosaic patterns with patches of high intensity fire (Mohr et al. 2000, Skinner et al. 2006, Perry et al. 2011). Fire has long been an important tool to manipulate landscape to patch-scale fire necessary for Karuk cultural sustenance and well-being (Lake 2013). Indeed, Karuk culture is directly dependent on mixed fire severity regimes (Lake 2007, Norgaard 2014). Karuk fire management practices include burning at a specific season, frequency, and intensity at a variety of severities. This frequent, low-intensity fire is linked with various fire-adapted vegetation communities and it necessary for the maintenance of cultural resources. Fire is especially critical for restoring grasslands for elk, managing for food sources including tanoak and black oak acorns, maintaining quality basketry materials, producing smoke that shades the river for fish, and more.\nThe passage of the Weeks Act in 1911 following the Big Burn of 1910, made cultural uses of fire essentially illegal and for the many decades following, less and less burning occurred while more and more vegetation grew. Over a century of policies of fire suppression have created the conditions for the catastrophic, high-intensity wildfires we are seeing today. Warming temperatures and summer droughts further exacerbate these conditions.\nIn the context of climate change, Karuk tribal knowledge and management principles regarding the use of fire are being utilized to reduce the likelihood of high severity fires. Fortunately, in the face of the changing climate, many ecologists, fire scientists and policy makers, Native and non-Native alike have turned to indigenous knowledge and management practices with renewed interest and optimism in the hope that they may provide a much-needed path towards both adaptation and reducing emissions (Williams and Hardison 2013, Martinez 2011, Raygorodetsky 2011, Vinyeta and Lynn 2013, Whyte 2013, Wildcat 2009). In particular, there is increasing recognition of the importance of indigenous burning as an ecosystem process and restoration technique.\nText: For thousands of years the landscapes of North America have been intensively managed and shaped through the use of traditional fire.\nLeaf Hillman: Fear of fire is what brought us to this place where we are at today, where we really have reason to fear fire.\nText: The Karuk Tribe of northern California is one of many Indigenous nations that use fire traditonally as a tool.\nAnalisa Tripp: Prescribed fire can be a tool, perhaps the most powerful tool, to combat the impacts of high severity fires.\nText: Prescribed fire clears out the dense brush that would fuel high severity fires.\nLeaf Hillman: We have to re-establish a positive relationship with fire. Our knowledge of this landscape and the use of fire to protect our communities, to enhance the resources that we need to survive—it’s here.\nText: Fire suppression is extremely costly and actually leads to more massive wildfires. Climate change is making this problem worse.\nAnalisa Tripp: People are seeing the benefits of prescribed fire more now than they have in a long time, over a hundred years. When you see it, you realize, ‘oh, it’s gonna be OK.’\nLeaf Hillman: The more time goes on that we don’t put fire back on these landscapes at the time and at the scale that we need to, then it’s gonna do it—not on our terms. Fire suppression has failed. Our first response has to be, ‘manage it.’ Not suppress it, but ‘manage it.’\nVideo by: Jenny Staats, Bruno Seraphin, Kari Norgaard\nAdditional video: Deer Creek GIS, ABC News, Klamath-Salmon Media Collaborative, The Press Democrat, Karuk Tribe Department of Natural Resources Wildlife Department, Mid Klamath Watershed Council\nMusic: Brian Tripp\nLeaf Hillman, Director of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy, Department of Natural Resources, Karuk Tribe\nAnalisa Tripp, Cultural Technician III, Department of Natural Resources, Karuk Tribe\nFinancial support provided by the U.S. Department of Energy.\nAnderson, M.

{"question":"What challenges do Vietnamese logistics firms face with EVFTA implementation, and how can third-party logistics providers help address market entry barriers?","answer":"Vietnamese logistics firms face fierce competition from major European players, particularly from the Netherlands and Belgium, requiring them to invest in technologies, infrastructure, and upgrade corporate governance capabilities. To remain competitive, they need systematic investments from both companies and government. Meanwhile, third-party logistics providers can help address market entry barriers by offering comprehensive services that allow companies to explore the Vietnamese market without major capital investment. They can handle the entire logistics process including customs clearance, storage, and order fulfillment, while also offering flexible entry options such as supporting Representative Offices with distribution services, making it easier for small and medium-sized enterprises to enter the market with lower risk and investment.","context":["Vietnam logistics firms pressured to grow or face being taken over in EVFTA era\nThe Hanoitimes - Vietnam’s targets of becoming Asia’s logistics hub would only be feasible if local firms can fence off competition from the world’s major logistics players.\nOnce the EU – Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) comes into force, European investors are entitled to purchase up to 51% stakes in Vietnamese logistics firms, putting them under two options: to grow or being taken over, said Nguyen Canh Cuong, trade counsellor at the Vietnamese Embassy in the UK.\n|Overview of the conference. Source: Hai Yen.|\n“Alongside new opportunities, it is inevitable that Vietnamese firms would face fiercer competition from major logistics players in Europe right in their home soil,” said Cuong at a conference discussing the impacts of the EVFTA on Vietnam’s logistics sector on December 24.\n“A trade deal with the EU is a huge boost for Vietnam’s exports, particularly as the deal is the EU’s first of its kind with a developing country in Asia,” Cuong added, saying more imports are predicted to come with tariff reductions and growing disposable income in Vietnam.\nThis sets a perfect context for the local logistics sector to grow, with “more goods to transport, more customers and more investments,” Cuong added.\nEventually, the sector would benefit from greater foreign investment inflow and advanced corporate governance methods, he stated.\nIn this context, Cuong expected local logistics firms to prepare for competition through investing in technologies and infrastructures, upgrading corporate governance capabilities and services qualities.\nCuong suggested merger should be a viable option to form new businesses with higher competitiveness.\nRegarding the issue, Ta Hoang Linh, director of the European – American Market Department under the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT), said the EU would require an advanced logistics chain to ensure the preservation of quality and freshness of goods and products transported to its 512-million market .\nThis is particularly important for Vietnam as the country’s export staples to the EU are agricultural, craft and wooden products, while the EU is Vietnam’s second largest export market with a 13.6-fold increase in bilateral trade turnover in in the 2000 - 2018 period, from US$4.1 billion in 2000 to US$55.8 billion in 2018.\nLinh said Vietnam’s target of becoming one of Asia’s logistics hubs by 2025 would only be feasible if Vietnamese firms can fence off competition from European logistics firms, particularly those leading companies in the field from the Netherlands and Belgium.\n“More systematic investments are needed to enhance competitiveness of local firms, which should come from not only these companies themselves, but also from the government,” Linh stated.\nA report from the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce and Industry (VCCI) showed the domestic’s logistics sector recorded growth rate of 12 – 14% annually over the last few years, reaching annual revenue of US$40 – 42 billion and contributing 4 – 5% of the GDP.\nAs of present, Vietnam has 30,000 logistics companies, an increase from 23,000 in 2016, including 4,000 operating in domestic and international cargo transportation.\nLocal logistics firms, mostly small and mediumsized, are holding 23 – 30% of the market share, while the remaining share belongs to around 30 multinational peers.\nIn 2018, Vietnam ranked 39th out of 160 countries and territories in the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI), up 25 places from 2017, and only behind Singapore and Thailand in ASEAN.\nThe World Bank estimated by 2030, the CPTPP would help boost Vietnam’s GDP growth by 1.1 – 3.5 percentage points, resulting in an increase of 4.2 – 6.9% in exports and 5.3 – 7.6% in imports.\n- Vietnam car imports surge over 85% in August\n- Vietnam GDP growth to reach 8.1% in 2021: Goldman Sachs\n- Room remains large for Vietnam to increase exports to EU\n- Vietnam urged to step up fight against origin frauds\n- Vietnamese agricultural exports to EU begin enjoying EVFTA benefits\n- ADB cuts Vietnam GDP growth forecast to 1.8% in 2020\n- Vietnam trade surplus more than doubles in Jan-Aug\n- Car sales in Vietnam down 14% on “ghost month”\n- Vietnam exports nearly 900 million medical face masks in 8 months\n- Predicted consumer resets to shape Vietnam FMCG market: Nielsen\nVietnam advances greatly in gender equality, but remains far from full equality: UN Women\nDrastic measures needed to realize disbursement target of public funds\nVietnam PM requests thorough studies for night economy development\nColorful Hanoi’s street with mid-autumn toys and decorations\nApple partner Pegatron mulls US$1-billion investment in hi-tech projects in Vietnam\nHanoi’s weekend pedestrian streets allowed to reopen from September 18\nEuropean investors propose US$1 billion logistics project in Vietnam\nVietnam says ASEAN doesn’t want to get trapped between competition of major powers\nVietnam launches advisory message to prevent Covid-19 spread","By: Maxfield Brown\nVietnam is a significant target for companies in the consumer goods sector. The country’s blossoming middle class, shifting spending habits, and a sizable population of over 90 million is rapidly becoming the focal point for investors building up brand identity and sales networks throughout the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). As the fundamentals of the Vietnamese economy continue to fall into place, foreign companies who are able to develop and implement effective market-entry strategies will be well positioned to gain increasing market share in the years to come.\nFor the largest players, Vietnam’s demographics and proximity to other markets present an opportunity to establish localized production and to expand distribution networks through mergers and acquisitions. Small and medium sized players, however, for whom the costs of setting up can often be inhibitive, increasingly turn to third-party logistics providers to boost their sales and build brand identity within Vietnam.\nIn general terms, third-party logistics, or 3PL as it is commonly referred, involves the outsourcing of logistics functions – such as customs clearance, storage of products, and order fulfillment – to a third party. Depending on the 3PL provider and range of services utilized, third party logistics can completely remove the need for a foreign company to establish a market presence in Vietnam. Instead, all operations can be run out of a single regional management center where the costs and risks of doing business are lower.\nWhat types of third party logistics services are available in Vietnam?\n3PL providers can offer a variety of services to companies seeking to outsource logistics functions in Vietnam. For those unfamiliar with the third party logistics industry, the following lists common 3PL services in Vietnam ordered in terms of their rates of usage by foreign investors currently engaging 3PL providers.\n- Domestic transportation – 92%\n- International transportation – 89%\n- Warehousing – 70%\n- Customs clearance – 68%\n- Forwarding – 60%\n- Shipment consolidation – 40%\n- Product labeling/packaging – 33%\n- Transportation management – 25%\n- Reverse logistics – 25%\n- Cross-docking – 25%\n- Freight auditing and payment – 18%\n- Fleet management – 15%\n- Order entry, processing, and fulfillment – 12%\nWhich companies will benefit from 3PL services?\nThe decision to engage a 3PL provider and the exact services required by a company will ultimately ride on the findings of a cost-benefit comparison between the acquisition of physical assets to facilitate distribution and the engagement of a local 3PL provider to handle these tasks. While each company will differ in terms of its products and business strategy, 3PL providers are generally of greatest utility to mid-market players seeking to explore the Vietnamese market for the first time.\nParticularly for those with low headcounts, the resources needed to fully commit to the Vietnamese market may make market entry a daunting task. In these cases, the low-profile approach provided through 3PL allows companies the flexibility to build up name recognition and sales while temporarily avoiding the capital-intensive process of establishing a foreign-owned trading company.\nHow to structure 3PL networks to boost sales?\nCompanies must choose a corporate structure that reflects their desired level of involvement in Vietnam. Below, we outline two of the most common low-cost 3PL entry strategies – selling into the Vietnamese market without a legal entity and outsourcing order fulfillment while maintaining a representative office to facilitate sales. Both of these options perfectly suit SMEs seeking to explore opportunities and expand sales networks within the Vietnamese market.\nOption 1 – Fully outsourcing operations\nCompanies with existing Vietnamese customers can often utilize 3PL providers to handle the entire logistics process and remove the need to maintain a physical presence in the county entirely. Under this structure, 3PL providers import goods on behalf of the foreign company, handle the customs process, store goods for the company within Vietnam, and fulfill orders on behalf of the company throughout the country.\nFor firms with concerns over establishing a physical presence in Vietnam, fully outsourcing operations to a 3PL provider may be a good first step towards becoming more comfortable with the Vietnamese market. However, it is also important to point out that the range of services provided by the 3PL, in this case, will likely come at a significant service fee. Furthermore, it may be difficult to maintain and expand relationships with current and future customers without a more significant on the ground presence.\nAs such, distribution under a fully outsourced model is only recommended for companies confident in their ability to fill orders in the near to medium term and require an immediate solution to distribute their goods within Vietnam. This is a particularly good option for companies which have managed to effectively market their goods to large buyers on a wholesale level and therefore do not desire to further expand their networks within Vietnam.\nOption 2 – Order fulfillment support\nAn increasingly common structure involves the establishment of a Representative Office (RO) to supplement the services of 3PL providers with sales and marketing support. ROs provide a much lower investment profile compared to establishing a 100 percent foreign owned entity (100% FOE) and allow investors to minimize financial exposure while maintaining direct connections with 3PL providers and customers. ROs are faced with lower capital requirements and setup times and are not subject to corporate income tax as they are prevented from directly invoicing clients.\nUnder current Vietnamese law, ROs are limited to hiring staff to conduct marketing and market research activities and are not permitted to revive incoming payments. While preventing investors from billing their clients within Vietnam, the RO structure does allow foreign companies to maintain a sales team within the Vietnamese market while outsourcing the import and distribution of goods to a 3PL provider. Compared to the costs associated with 100 FOE setup and the lack of on the ground presence stemming from a fully outsourced distribution operation, supplementation of 3PL services with RO sales support is currently the preferred method of entry for SMEs.\nThe role of regional management\nWhile Vietnam continues to provide among the most attractive consumer markets regionally, it is far from the only market where opportunities lie. Increasingly, companies choose to target not one but many markets in Southeast Asia for expansion simultaneously. In these cases, it often makes sense to establish a regional management center in Asia from which to base operations. This center will be able to handle the contractual relationships with 3PL providers – an area beyond the legal scope of representative office operations – and to handle the invoicing of clients in some cases.\nAt present Singapore is the best-positioned location from which to base operations due to its extensive trade and tax agreements covering Vietnam, other ASEAN members, as well as many of home markets for Vietnam’s current investors such as China, the United States, the European Union, Japan, and Korea.\nThe importance of evaluating 3PL providers\nFinally, following the selection of a market entry method, investors must select a 3PL provider that can effectively support their agenda in Vietnam. While 3PL firms are in ample supply, these partners will take on a significant degree of control over the storage and transport of a company’s goods. As such, there is potential for the quality of goods and service provided by the 3PL to influence the reputation of a good or brand, particularly in the initial stages of a company’ entry into Vietnam.\nWith this in mind, the following are some of the most important considerations for new entrants to Vietnam to consider when selecting a 3PL provider:\nConsumption centers in Vietnam are spread across the country. Ranging from Ho Chi Minh City in the South, to Da Nang in the Center, and Hanoi in the North, it is important for investors to understand consumption trends within their respective business lines and to engage a 3PL provider that can store and possibly transport goods between these targeted locations effectively. Many firms entering the market find that it is more effective to engage with separate 3PL providers in different locations within the country to ensure that they are able to provide the most effective delivery to their clients in every location.\nStorage and transport capacity\nIn addition to geographic coverage, it is important to select a 3PL provider that has the capacity and specialization to transport the goods that a company wishes to distribute in Vietnam. For frozen goods and other items requiring the use of cold chain logistics networks, specialized transportation equipment and storage will certainly be required. In these cases, vetting 3PL providers prior to engagement will ensure that they are able to are able to provide the storage and transport specifications to meet the standards of a given product.\nRange of service lines\nMore generally, companies should review 3PL providers to select a firm that can provide the services needed to implement their market entry strategy. This will include assessing firms based on their ability to invoice clients, clear goods through customs, or conduct other aspects of logistics outsourcing required for a given operation. Each firm will likely have different services and a be able to provide a different range of services depending on the part of the country that they are operating in.\nFinally, due diligence on 3PL providers is the most important consideration from a brand reputation perspective. Given the opaque nature of Vietnam’s business environment, investors often struggle to assess the reputation of 3PL providers from outside of the country. This, along with ongoing coordination with clients often forms the basis for investors decisions to set up a representative office to further expand their operations in Vietnam.\nVietnam Briefing is published by Asia Briefing, a subsidiary of Dezan Shira & Associates.

{"question":"What is the difference between immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and TLR4's role in immune response?","answer":"Immunoglobulin gene rearrangement involves the complex process of randomly assembling different gene segments (V, D, J) to generate unique antigen receptors in B-cells, and is used to help diagnose B-cell lymphomas. In contrast, TLR4 functions as a pre-formed sentinel receptor of the innate immune system that recognizes bacterial LPS and can trigger cytokine production, representing a more immediate response mechanism to pathogens.","context":["- HTA125 (See other available formats)\n- HCDM listed\n- Other Names\n- Toll-like Receptor 4, TLR4, TLR-4, CD284\n- Mouse IgG2a, κ\n- Ave. Rating\n- Submit a Review\n- Product Citations\n|Cat #||Size||Price||Quantity Avail.||Save|\nToll-like receptors are type I transmembrane signaling receptors. They are primordial pathogen-recognition proteins that function as sentinels for the innate immune system. TLR4, also known as CD284, is a 110 kD protein which is expressed on monocytes/macrophages, endothelial cells, and at low levels on B cells and granulocytes. In association with a secretory molecule, MD2, TLR4 has been recognized as critical for host recognition of bacterial LPS.

They function in conjunction with other receptor families including the integrins and selectins.\nWhich are the immunoglobulin superfamily?\nThe immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) is a class of proteins that are associated with the adhesion, binding and recognition processes of cells. The term “immunoglobulin superfamily” (IgSF) initially referred to Igs and other proteins involved in the immune response and sharing the same 3D topology.\nWhat is the specific feature of any member of immunoglobulin family?\nMembers of the Immunoglobulin superfamily include vascular and neural cell adhesions molecules (VCAM and NCAM), intercellular adhesion molecules (ICAM) and the Nectins and nectin-like (Necl) proteins.\nWhat superfamily does MHC come from?\nMembers of the immunoglobulin superfamily\n|Antigen presenting molecules||Class I MHC Class II MHC beta-2 microglobulin|\n|Co-receptors||CD4 CD8 CD19|\n|Antigen receptor accessory molecules||CD3-γ, -δ and -ε chains CD79a and CD79b|\nHow is the structure of immunoglobulin related to its function?\nImmunoglobulins are heterodimeric proteins composed of two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains. They can be separated functionally into variable (V) domains that binds antigens and constant (C) domains that specify effector functions such as activation of complement or binding to Fc receptors.\nAre T cell receptors part of the immunoglobulin superfamily?\nAntibodies, T cell receptors and major histocompatibility complex molecules are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily and have pivotal roles in the immune system.\nHow are MHC proteins formed?\nFunction. Class I MHC molecules bind peptides generated mainly from degradation of cytosolic proteins by the proteasome. The MHC I:peptide complex is then inserted via endoplasmic reticulum into the external plasma membrane of the cell. The epitope peptide is bound on extracellular parts of the class I MHC molecule.\nWhat stimulates VDJ recombination?\nV(D)J recombination is initiated by the RAG recombinase, a protein complex which consists primarily of the proteins encoded by RAG1 and RAG2. The RAG complex functions as a site-specific endonuclease that creates DSBs at specific recombination signal sequences (RSSs) adjacent to each V, D, and J gene segment.\nWhat is immunoglobulin gene rearrangement?\nB-cell immunoglobulin gene rearrangement tests are used to help diagnose non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas and evaluate for residual or recurrent disease after treatment. There are many different types of B-cell lymphoma and each has different characteristics, prognoses, and a likely response to therapy.\nWhat are the immunoglobulin types and functions?\nThe five primary classes of immunoglobulins are IgG, IgM, IgA, IgD and IgE. These are distinguished by the type of heavy chain found in the molecule. IgG molecules have heavy chains known as gamma-chains; IgMs have mu-chains; IgAs have alpha-chains; IgEs have epsilon-chains; and IgDs have delta-chains.\nHow Are immunoglobulin and T cell receptors similar?\nT-cell receptors are structurally similar to immunoglobulins and are encoded by homologous genes. T-cell receptor genes are assembled by somatic recombination from sets of gene segments in the same way as are the immunoglobulin genes.\nWhere do MHC molecules come from?\nClass I MHC molecules span the membrane of almost every cell in an organism, while class II molecules are restricted to cells of the immune system called macrophages and lymphocytes. In humans these molecules are encoded by several genes all clustered in the same region on chromosome 6.\nHow many MHC genes are there?\nIn humans, the MHC region occurs on chromosome 6, between the flanking genetic markers MOG and COL11A2 (from 6p22. 1 to 6p21. 3 about 29Mb to 33Mb on the hg38 assembly), and contains 224 genes spanning 3.6 megabase pairs (3 600 000 bases). About half have known immune functions.\nWhat is the purpose of VDJ recombination?\nVDJ recombination is the process by which T cells and B cells randomly assemble different gene segments – known as variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) genes – in order to generate unique receptors (known as antigen receptors) that can collectively recognize many different types of molecule.\nWhat happens during the rearrangement of immunoglobulin genes?\nImmunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement begins in early pro-B cells with D to JH joining. This typically occurs at both alleles of the heavy-chain locus, at which point the cell becomes a late pro-B cell. The cell then proceeds to rearrange a VH gene segment to the DJH sequence."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:59558412-5234-4b88-8d22-5f24bdab59b6>","<urn:uuid:c472ce6f-8051-4757-9778-2551de65829e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey, I study environmental science and want to understand how human activities contribute to global warming. Can you explain the main ways we affect greenhouse gas emissions?","answer":"Human activities contribute to greenhouse gas emissions in several major ways: 1) Through burning fossil fuels for various activities, which produces carbon dioxide emissions, 2) Through livestock and rice farming as well as landfills, which generate methane, 3) Through agriculture using synthetic fertilizers, fossil fuel combustion and livestock manure management, which produce nitrous oxide, 4) Through refrigeration, cooling and manufacturing applications that release fluorinated gases, and 5) Through deforestation, which both releases stored carbon dioxide and reduces the number of trees that can absorb CO2 from the air.","context":["Deforestation and desertification have led to massive climatic repercussions and have gravely accentuated global warming. Currently, global warming is leading to rise in temperature of the Earth’s surface, as well as, the Earth’s atmosphere. Over the last century, average temperatures around the world have risen by 0.75 degree C (1.4 degree F). Today, the rise in temperature is no longer a natural phenomenon. However, a long series of scientific researches and international studies by the national science academies has stated that this increase in overall temperatures is due to the anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases. Activities such as deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels have contributed largely towards these emissions.\nCauses of global warming\nGlobal levels of greenhouse gases have increased dramatically since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution in the 1750s. When greenhouse gases rise abnormally, they start accumulating in the air, trapping more heat and intensifying the effects of global warming. These gases are produced both naturally and through human activities.\nMan-made carbon dioxide emissions are largely contributed by burning of fossil fuels for human activities. Other important sources come from land-use changes and industry. Methane is created by humans during fossil fuel production and use, through livestock and rice farming and from landfills. Nitrous oxide emissions are mainly caused by the use of synthetic fertilisers for agriculture, fossil fuel combustion and livestock manure management. Fluorinated gases are used mainly in refrigeration, cooling and manufacturing applications.\nDeforestation has become a massive undertaking by humans and transforming forests into farms. This has impacted the greenhouse gas emissions for centuries as people have burned and cut down forests to clear land for agriculture. This has a double effect on the atmosphere as it entails emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and also involves reducing the number of trees that can absorb carbon dioxide from the air.\nEffects of global warming\nOne of the most visible effects of global warming can be seen in the melting of the polar ice caps and the resultant rise of sea levels. The climatic shifts impacted by global warming is damaging the Earth’s environment and transforming lands into arid and semi-arid areas.\nCurrent research is also showing that the water cycle is changing and rainfall patterns are shifting to make areas that are already dry even drier. This is causing water shortages and intensifying the distress of the over 2.5 million people in dry regions, which are getting drier.\nThe rate of melting of mountain ice has increased. This has been seen in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa but is particularly true at the Earth’s poles. Perennial ice cover in the Arctic is melting at the rate of 11.5% per decade and the thickness of the Arctic ice has decreased by 48% since the 1960s. During the past 30 years, more than a million square miles of sea ice has vanished. The continent of Antarctica has been losing more than 100 cubic kilometres (24 cubic miles) of ice per year since 2002. Since 2010, the Antarctic ice melt rate has doubled. The Earth’s sea level has risen by 21 cm (8 inches) since 1880. The rate of rise is accelerating and is now at a pace that has not been witnessed in the last 5000 years.\nSpirituality and global warming\nIn ancient Greece, the Earth’s atmosphere was known as the air between the land and the heavens and was seen as one of the four essential powers of nature, along with earth, fire, and water. The Greek philosopher Plato considered these four elements as the divine tools used by the Demiurge (divine craftsman) in creating the world. The philosopher Aristotle felt that these four elements must be in balance, because each carries a quality that is necessary for life. Thousands of years before Plato and Aristotle, religious traditions in the Indian subcontinent also emphasised the interconnectedness of air, earth, fire, and water. A balance of these natural elements was seen as a manifestation of Līlā, the creative play of the Gods. In this creative action, air and wind had special importance because Prāṇa (the breath) was considered the source of life itself.\nToday, Hindu spirituality still promotes the belief that the human spirit longs for equilibrium – the condition when one’s spirit is aligned with the symmetry of air, earth, fire, and water. Unfortunately, humans too have often disregarded this symmetry, thereby harming themselves and nature. This leads to spiritual degradation. The only lasting remedy is to recover one’s spiritual connection with nature. As the 2009 Hindu Declaration on Climate Change says, “Humanity’s very survival depends upon our capacity to make a major transition of consciousness, equal in significance to earlier transitions from nomadic to agricultural, agricultural to industrial and industrial to technological. We must transit to complementarity in place of competition, convergence in place of conflict, holism in place of hedonism, optimisation in place of maximisation.”\nTo maintain the equilibrium, humans should maintain peace with Nature. Through ones sublime spirit, one should maintain the Earth and its environment. We should take efforts to protect our climate, stop deforestation, preserve nature, stop felling trees, and in fact, stop being the cause of global warming. The authors of ‘Healing Earth’ believe that every human being has spirituality. It is the expression of our deepest beliefs about our planet. From ancient times, human beings have taken the familiar patterns of climate and weather in their environment as a source for inner, spiritual balance. Conversely, one can understand how a permanent change in climate can shatter not only the ‘outer’ working lives of human beings but also their inner spiritual lives. The present environmental challenges are extremely serious. We need to consider the spiritual wisdom of all people as we face these challenges."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:855377da-7627-49d9-81c2-3beee78e4bba>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do stakeholder collaboration approaches compare between integrative design process and maintenance management certifications?","answer":"The integrative design process emphasizes involving all stakeholders (building owners, facility managers, operations staff, tenants, design professionals, codes developers, and portfolio managers) to identify synergies and optimize energy efficiency in buildings. In contrast, maintenance management certifications, such as the Maintenance Management Certification (MMC), focus on teaching managers how to build and sustain programs independently, establish KPIs, select equipment, and implement work management strategies, with less emphasis on stakeholder collaboration and more on individual management capabilities.","context":["Integrative Design Process\nThe integrative design process understands that buildings, their components, and their use type and surroundings are interrelated. Involving all stakeholders helps to identify synergies and benefits that would otherwise go unnoticed to optimize energy efficiency in buildings. An integrated submetering team can involve the building owner, facility managers, operations and maintenance staff, tenants, design professionals, codes and standards developers, and portfolio managers with the goals to reduce resource consumption and reduce operating costs.\nIn order to implement well planned and integrated submetering systems, roles and responsibilities for stakeholders need to be clearly defined to meet anticipated performance outcomes. Based on the common objective for these stakeholders to maintain and preserve building assets, lower operating costs, and improve occupant satisfaction, roles associated with managing and analyzing submetering systems need to be directly linked to these core building duties. Personnel can leverage submetering systems to make smart operational, behavioral, and investments decisions from and for the following key entities.\nSubmetering systems help to efficiently manage a building’s resource use, thereby creating a more comfortable environment for all tenants and occupants. Building owners can install submetering systems for different uses according a building’s need and minimize resource use to the level needed to maintain and properly run a building or facility.\nFacility Managers and Operations and Maintenance Staff\nNo matter how sustainable a building may be in design and construction, it can only remain so if it is operated responsibly and maintained properly. Facility managers and operations and maintenance staff are instrumental in tracking individual building performance data, making data useful for other stakeholders, and taking corrective actions. Submetering systems provide early detection of problems by showing exactly where resource consumption needs to be better managed and highlighting abnormal usage patterns. Evaluating this data requires specific training on energy management and assessment systems, but facility managers can share this information with building occupants, tenants, and owners to improve building performance.\nSubmeters eliminate utility billing problems associated with arbitrary ratio-based measures (e.g. square footage) that favor high volume users over low-use tenants. Submetering systems at the tenant level equalizes the playing field in buildings that can allow tenants to benefit from energy conservation practices they implement. Monitoring energy consumption to reduce costs can create larger behavioral changes, like purchasing and using energy efficient appliances, working with operations and maintenance staff to reduce energy use, and make in impact in a building’s overall performance.\nData provides important input to the design process. The availability of focused data can help establish direction for designing, building, and maintaining high performance buildings for people to live and work in. Submetering systems help to measure and verify design strategies to inform actual performance and future needs for building stakeholders. Submetering systems help realize the full benefits of high performance design features by optimizing equipment operations and maintenance, efficiently managing resources, and increasing occupant awareness and behavior change.\nCodes and Standards Developers and Regulators\nEnergy usage data for different types of buildings can serve to validate requirements within existing codes and standards, or identify new approaches to achieve the intended results. By determining how buildings are really performing, a wide range of opportunities for the overall improvement of building operations and maintenance become available.\nPortfolio Managers are responsible for the overall performance of building operations and the management of projects for an assigned set of properties. Portfolio Managers can help to monitor to ensure consistency in practices, policies, and procedures across many buildings.","What does a maintenance manager do?\nMaintenance managers oversee a team of maintenance supervisors who manage the technicians and workload during a particular shift. Depending on the size of the organization, they report to either a maintenance director, president, or VP of operations.\nManagers must take a “big picture” view of the maintenance department and direct the long-term vision and comprehensive effort around building systems, equipment operations, and safe production standards. They keep the company’s goals in the forefront of their minds and are where the buck stops when it comes to OSHA requirements, applicable laws, and regulations.\nThe responsibilities of maintenance managers vary depending on the nature of the specific business. However, they typically include planning and directing overall maintenance work and coordinating responsibilities with maintenance supervisors to accomplish work in a timely and safe manner.\nMaintenance managers must hire, train, and develop the maintenance staff, working to keep a positive, team-oriented environment focused on delivering high-quality, safe, and efficient maintenance services.\nKey performance indicators include production uptime, budget adherence, schedule compliance, and safety metrics (e.g. number or incidents).\n- Sets vision, mission, and strategy for an entire maintenance department\n- Ensures all health, safety, and regulations are followed\n- Manages and maintains a preventive maintenance system to keep all day-to-day operations running smoothly\n- Oversees, motivates, and reviews maintenance team including management of training and professional development\n- Stays organized in facilities with robust PM schedules and continuous work requests\n- Leads maintenance supervisors in an effective, positive, and efficient manner\n- Understands and follows OSHA guidelines and other regulations\n- Exhibits problem solving and team building skills\nWho should hire a maintenance manager?\nUsually larger organizations require more layers of management to operate efficiently. A business, facility, or residential complex that has multiple locations, shifts, or buildings will benefit from having a maintenance manager.\nMaintenance managers can work with top executives to understand overall business strategy and then develop a supporting vision and mission for the maintenance department. This may include a focus on exceeding OSHA standards or other regulations, reducing downtime to increase machine efficiency, or obtaining superior customer satisfaction scores from tenants.\nWhat are the different types of maintenance managers?\nDifferent businesses require different types of maintenance managers. Below are some examples.\n- Plant Maintenance Manager — Ensures the operations of plant systems and equipment stays in excellent working order by managing maintenance supervisors over various shifts\n- Building Complex Maintenance Managers — Oversees supervisors who are responsible for the daily upkeep and operations of a particular building within a residential complex. They set big picture goals and manage complex-wide processes and procedures.\n- Facilities Maintenance Managers — Manages maintenance and engineering tasks including mechanical, electrical, and plumbing projects across an entire facility. Delegates shift-specific tasks to maintenance supervisors.\n- Public Works Maintenance Manager — Leads shift supervisors in various government-related departments including road maintenance, parks and recreation maintenance, and landscaping.\nWhat certifications are available for maintenance managers?\nThose aspiring to become maintenance managers can apply for the following certifications to advance their careers.\n- Maintenance Management Certification (MMC) — Several of the country’s top engineering schools offer certification programs. Maintenance managers can learn how to build and sustain a maintenance program, establish appropriate KPIs, select optimum equipment, and implement work management strategies.\n- Certified Manager of Maintenance — The National Center for Housing Management offers this certification and teaches managers how to plan maintenance tasks and make good decisions within a multi-family complex. Managers are trained on how to achieve maintenance goals quickly, correctly, and at the lowest possible cost. The program also shows how to improve work order systems and shares the latest tools and methods available.\n- NAHRO Certified Maintenance Manager — This certification is designed for managers of affordable or assisted housing complexes. A high school diploma, industry training, at least six months of on-the-job experience, completing an ethics seminar, and an examination are required for certification."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c6d352e8-c131-4e60-8927-5483d07b2e83>","<urn:uuid:4e1ba317-9465-4605-81f8-5165335557d4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does price control differ between Network Effect businesses and Perfect Competition markets?","answer":"In Network Effect businesses and Perfect Competition markets, price control works very differently. In Perfect Competition, firms are price-takers with no control over price, having to accept prices determined by market forces of demand and supply. In contrast, Network Effect businesses can often exercise significant price control as they benefit from exponential growth and value creation potential, creating 'Winner Take All' market opportunities that erect barriers to entry and thwart competition. This is particularly evident in platforms like Microsoft Windows or Apple App Store, where their network effects give them substantial pricing power compared to perfectly competitive firms.","context":["Network Effects are magical. They are the pixie dust that makes certain Information Technology businesses, especially on the Internet, into juggernauts. They can be found in both consumer and enterprise companies. Network Effects are special because they:\n- Provide logarithmic growth and value creation potential\n- Erect barriers to entry to thwart would-be competitors\n- Can create “Winner Take All” market opportunities\nNetwork Effects are like a flywheel–the faster you spin it the more momentum you generate and enjoy. But not all markets lend themselves to Network Effects. They are not the same as Economies of Scale where “bigger is better.” To be certain, Economies of Scale can give strong competitive advantage and defensibility to the first to get really big (or Minimum Efficient Scale as the economists call it.) For example, SAP and Oracle benefit from having massive revenue bases which enable them to employ armies of engineers who develop rich feature sets and also to hire huge sales forces. However large these companies are today, though, their growth rates, especially in their early years, were far more modest compared to those Network Effect companies whose growth resembled a curved ramp off of which they launched into the stratosphere.\nThere are four main types of Network Effects:\n- Classic Networks, in which the value of a product or service increases exponentially with the number of others using it. Communications networks like telephones, fax, Instant Messaging, texting, email, and Skype are all examples. Metcalfe’s Law captured this as a simple equation where the Value of a network = N², where N is the number of nodes. Typically, each node in a classic network is similar to each other and possesses both send and receive capabilities. This will become clear juxtaposed against the other network effects below where there are different types of nodes. Other examples of classic Networks are social networks (eg Facebook) and payments (eg PayPal).\n- Marketplaces, where aggregations of buyers and sellers attract each other. Lots of sellers means variety, competition, and price pressure, which all serve to attract more customers. And because the customers flock, more sellers are enticed to participate in the marketplace. eBay, stock exchanges, and advertising networks are all examples. One nuance of marketplaces, however, is they differ in terms of the scale required for acceptable liquidity. For example, ad networks can achieve sufficient reach and liquidity at relatively low levels which is why you see thousands of online ad networks, where they each exhibit network effects but not in a winner take all fashion. Stock exchanges and payment networks require far greater scale for network effects to operate, which is why you see much greater concentration in these industries.\n- Big Data Learning Loops. “Big Data” is all the rage in techland, but just having gobs of data is not necessarily a Network Effect, nor any sort of competitive advantage per se. What you really need is unique data and algorithms that process that data into insights which then lead to decisions and actions. A flywheel effect comes when you get a critical mass of data that you mine for insights; pump that value back in to your product or service; which attracts more users which get you more data. And so on. Venrock portfolio company Inrix is a good example, where they mine GPS data points to derive automotive traffic flow data. The more commercial fleets, mobile app users, and car companies they can get data from, the better their traffic analysis becomes, which gets them more users and hence more data. They turn data into an accuracy advantage that earns them the right to get even more data.\n- Platforms are a very special and powerful form of network effects. In Information Technology, a true “platform” is where other developers build technology and businesses on top of your technology and business because you offer them one or more of the following:\n- Lots of users/customers, and you represent a distribution opportunity for them\n- Compelling development tools, technology, and (sometimes) advantageous pricing\n- Monetization opportunities\nExample include Operating Systems like Microsoft Windows, Apple App Store, and Amazon Web Services.\nEach of these four types of network effects can be extremely powerful on their own. Yet, even more power is derived when a business can harness multiple types of network effects in synergistic ways. Google, Apple and Facebook do this for sure, but a less well known example is Venrock portfolio company AppNexus that operates a real-time online advertising exchange and technology platform. The exchange aggregates advertisers, agencies, publishers and ad networks for marketplace liquidity, but also offers a hosting and technology platform for other AdTech companies and ad networks to augment their own businesses. And the vast troves of data AppNexus processes every millisecond flows back into the system as optimized and targeted ad serving.\nNetwork Effects are what you want fueling your business. Sometimes you just need to get clever about discovering and harnessing them.","Perfect Competition Examples Essay\nPerfect Competition Examples\nMarket structure is best defined as the organizational and other characteristics of a market. We focus on those characteristics which affect the nature of competition and pricing.Traditionally, the most important features of market structure are:\n1. Number of Buyers and Sellers:\nNumber of buyers and sellers of a commodity in the market indicates the influence exercised by them on the price of the commodity. In case of large number of buyers and sellers, an individual buyer or seller is not in the position to influence the price of the commodity. However, if there is a single seller of a commodity, then such a seller exercises great control over the price.\n2. Nature of the Commodity:\nIf the commodity is of homogeneous nature, i.e. identical in all respects, then it is sold at a uniform price. However, if the commodity is of differentiated nature (like different brands of toothpaste), then it may be sold at different prices. Again, if the commodity has no close substitutes (like Railways), then the seller can charge higher price from the buyers.\n3. Freedom of Movement of Firms:\nIf there is freedom of entry and exit of firms, then price will be stable in the market. However, if there are restrictions on entry of new firms and exit of old firms, then a firm can influence the price as it has no fear of competition from other or new firms. 4. Knowledge of Market Conditions:\n4. Knowledge of Market Conditions:\nIf buyers and sellers have perfect knowledge about the market conditions, then a uniform price prevails in the market. However, in case of imperfect knowledge, sellers are in a position to charge different prices. 5. Mobility of Goods and Factors of Production:\n5. Mobility of Goods and Factors of Production:\nWhen the factors of production can move freely from one place to another, then a uniform price prevails in the market. However, in case of immobility of goods and factors, different prices may prevail in the market.\nHere are the four basic market structures:Perfect competition: Perfect competition happens when numerous small firms compete against each other. Firms in a competitive industry produce the socially optimal output level at the minimum possible cost per unit. Monopoly: A monopoly is a firm that has no competitors in its industry. It reduces output to drive up prices and increase profits. By doing so, it produces less than the socially optimal output level and produces at higher costs than competitive firms. Oligopoly: An oligopoly is an industry with only a few firms. If they collude, they reduce output and drive up profits the way a monopoly does.\nPerfect competition: Perfect competition happens when numerous small firms compete against each other.

It reduces output to drive up prices and increase profits. By doing so, it produces less than the socially optimal output level and produces at higher costs than competitive firms. Oligopoly: An oligopoly is an industry with only a few firms. If they collude, they reduce output and drive up profits the way a monopoly does.\nHowever, because of strong incentives to cheat on collusive agreements, oligopoly firms often end up competing against each other. Monopolistic competition: In monopolistic competition, an industry contains many competing firms, each of which has a similar but at least slightly different product. Restaurants, for example, all serve food but of different types and in different locations. Production costs are above what could be achieved if all the firms sold identical products, but consumers benefit from the variety. Other than the above mentioned four,\nDuopoly(a special case of an oligopoly with two firms) Monopsony, (when there is only one buyer in a market) and Oligopsony (a market where many sellers can be present but meet only a few buyers are also among different market structures.\nAs mentioned earlier, the identifying characteristics for each type of market structure include the Degree of Price Control\nNature of Demand Curve\nInfluence on Activities of other Firms\n(I) Degree of Price Control:\nA firm under Perfect competition is a Price-taker, i.e. an individual firm has no control over the price and has to accept the price as determined by the market forces of demand and supply. Monopoly:\nA monopolist is a Price-Maker, i.e., a firm has complete control over the price and fixes its own price. Monopolistic Competition:\nA firm under monopolistic competition has partial control over the price, i.e. each firm is neither a price-taker nor a price-maker. An individual firm is able to influence the price by creating a differentiated image of its product through heavy selling costs. Oligopoly:\nA firm under oligopoly follows the policy of price rigidity. Although, the firm can influence the prices, but it prefers to stick to its prices so as to avoid a price war. (II) Nature of Demand Curve:\ni. Perfect Competition:\nThe demand curve for a perfectly competitive firm is perfectly elastic as it has to accept the price fixed by the market forces of demand and supply. ii. Monopoly:\nThe monopoly firm faces a downward sloping demand curve as more quantity can be sold only at a lower price. iii. Monopolistic Competition:\nThe firm under monopolistic competition also faces a downward sloping demand curve as more quantity can be sold only at a lower price. However, the demand curve is more elastic in comparison to demand curve under monopoly because of presence of close substitutes. iv. Oligopoly:\nThe demand curve for an oligopoly firm is indeterminate, i.e. it cannot be drawn accurately as exact behavior pattern of a producer cannot be ascertained with certainty. (III) Influence on Activities of other Firms:\ni. Perfect Competition:\nEach firm is so small that its behavior has no influence on the decisions of other firms operating in the market. ii. Monopoly:\nThere is only one firm in the industry. Therefore, the question of reaction from other firms does not arise, i.e. monopolist has full control over the industry. iii. Monopolistic Competition:\nThere are large numbers of firms and behaviour of each firm has less impact on activities of other firms. iv. Oligopoly:\nThere are few firms and behaviour of each firm has significant impact on activities of other firms. (IV) Overall Comparison:\nWhat we analyze in all market structures and why the perfect competition is the most efficient? AR,MR\nThe point where MR=MC (Profit maximum)\nQ* (equilibrium quantity)\nP* (equilibrium price)\nPerfect Competition – Economics of Competitive Markets\nPure or perfect competition is rare in the real world, but the model is important because it helps competition analyze industries with characteristics similar to pure competition. Examples of perfect competition are stock market and agricultural industries.\nThe individual firm will view its demand as perfectly elastic. A perfectly elastic demand curve is a horizontal line at the price. The demand curve for the industry is not perfectly elastic, it only appears that way to the individual firms, since they must take the market price no matter what quantity they produce. Therefore, the firm’s demand curve is a horizontal line at the market price. Marginal revenue (MR) is the increase in total revenue resulting from a one-unit increase in output. Since the price is constant in the perfect competition. The increase in total revenue from producing 1 extra unit will equal to the price. Therefore, P= MR in perfect.\nIn the short run, the interaction between demand and supply determines the “market-clearing” price. A price P1 is established and output Q1 is produced. This price is taken by each firm. The average revenue curve is their individual demand curve. Since the market price is constant for each unit sold, the AR curve also becomes the marginal revenue curve (MR) for a firm in perfect competition. For the firm, the profit maximising output is at Q2 where MC=MR. This output generates a total revenue (P1 x Q2). Since total revenue exceeds total cost, the firm in our example is making abnormal (economic) profits. This is not necessarily the case for all firms in the industry since it depends on the position of their short run cost curves. Some firms may be experiencing sub-normal profits if average costs exceed the price – and total costs will be greater than total revenue.\nThe adjustment to the long-run equilibrium in perfect competition If most firms are making abnormal profits in the short run, this encourages the entry of new firms into the industry This will cause an outward shift in market supply forcing down the price The increase in supply will eventually reduce the price until price = long run average cost. At this point, each firm in the industry is making normal profit. Other things remaining the same, there is no further incentive for movement of firms in and out of the industry and a long-run equilibrium has been established. This is shown in the next diagram. Assuming in the diagram above that there has been no shift in market demand. The effect of increased supply is to force down the price and causes an expansion along the market demand curve. But for each supplier, the price they “take” is now lower and it is this that drives down the level of profit made towards normal profit equilibrium. Characteristics of competitive markets\nThe common characteristics of markets that are considered to be “competitive” are: Lower prices because of many competing firms. The cross-price elasticity of demand for one product will be high suggesting that consumers are prepared to switch their demand to the most competitively priced products in the marketplace. Low barriers to entry – the entry of new firms provides competition and ensures prices are kept low in the long run. Lower total profits and profit margins than in markets which dominated by a few firms. Greater entrepreneurial activity – the Austrian school of economics argues that competition is a process. For competition to be improved and sustained there needs to be a genuine desire on behalf of entrepreneurs to innovate and to invent to drive markets forward and create what Joseph Schumpeter called the “gales of creative destruction”. Economic efficiency – competition will ensure that firms move towards productive efficiency. The threat of competition should lead to a faster rate of technological diffusion, as firms have to be responsive to the changing needs of consumers. This is known as dynamic efficiency. The importance of non-price competition\nIn competitive markets, non-price competition can be crucial in winning sales and protecting or enhancing market share. Perfect competition and efficiency Perfect competition can be used as a yardstick to compare with other market structures because it displays high levels of economic efficiency.\n1. Allocative efficiency: In both the short and long run we find that price is equal to marginal cost (P=MC) and thus allocative efficiency is achieved. At the ruling price, consumer and producer surplus are maximised. No one can be made better off without making some other agent at least as worse off – i.e. we achieve a Pareto optimum allocation of resources.\n2. Productive efficiency: Productive efficiency occurs when the equilibrium output is supplied at minimum average cost. This is attained in the long run for a competitive market. Firms with high unit costs may not be able to justify remaining in the industry as the forces of competition drive down the market price.\n3. Dynamic efficiency: Since perfectly competitive market produces homogeneous products – in other words, there is little scope for innovation designed purely to make products differentiated from each other and allow a supplier to develop and then exploit a competitive advantage in the market to establish some monopoly power. Some economists claim that perfect competition is not a good market structure for high levels of research and development spending and the resulting product and process innovations. Indeed it may be the case that monopolistic or oligopolistic markets are more effective long term in creating the environment for research and innovation to flourish. A cost-reducing innovation from one producer will, under the assumption of perfect information, be immediately and without cost transferred to all of the other suppliers.\nThat said a contestable market provides the discipline on firms to keep their costs under control, to seek to minimise wastage of scarce resources and to refrain from exploiting the consumer by setting high prices and enjoying high profit margins. In this sense, competition can stimulate improvements in both static and dynamic efficiency over time. The long run of perfect competition, therefore, exhibits optimal levels of economic efficiency. But for this to be achieved all of the conditions of perfect competition must hold – including in related markets. When the assumptions are dropped, we move into a world of imperfect competition with all of the potential that exists for various forms of market failure\nInefficiency in Monopolistic Competition\nMonopoly is the other market structure, which is most different from perfect competition. Compared to a perfectly competitive market monopoly is less efficient . Monopolistic firms’ profit maximizing production levels occur when their marginal revenues equals their marginal costs. This quantity is less than what would be produced in a perfectly competitive market. It also means that producers will supply goods below their manufacturing capacity. Monopoly creates deadweight loss and inefficiency, as represented by the yellow triangle. The quantity is produced when marginal revenue equals marginal cost, or where the green and blue lines intersect. The price is determined based on where the quantity falls on the demand curve, or the red line.\nConclusion: The importance of market structure in an economy cannot be over emphasized as the effect of market structure on an economy, it’s development or degradation is recently been realized. Thus we as the part of the economy need to understand the value of this concept while dealing with others (buyers/sellers) in any market place to yield the optimum benefit and to create win-win situation for all of us.\nGrant SJ.(2000), Introductory Economics, (7th edn), Pearsons Eucation, UK. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_structure http://www.slideshare.net/mithileshtrivedi581/market-structure-and-types-of-market-strucyure"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:156fe024-6ad0-4247-921d-1e2989e73eb5>","<urn:uuid:a94a352c-45f9-4b0a-b812-8caa8bc2efaa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do red foxes and arctic foxes differ in their population dynamics and what influences their numbers?","answer":"Red foxes and arctic foxes exhibit different population dynamics influenced by distinct factors. Arctic fox populations fluctuate dramatically in relation to lemming abundance, with population size varying ten to twentyfold between years, and even hundredfold increases during peak lemming cycles every 3-4 years. When lemmings crash, arctic foxes face high mortality from fatigue, cold, and starvation. In contrast, red fox populations in North America have shown a general pattern of range expansion, particularly in the eastern United States where they became common in the mid-1800s, spreading from their native boreal and western montane regions into new lowland areas, influenced primarily by anthropogenic habitat changes rather than prey cycles.","context":["Title: The origin of recently established red fox populations in the United States: translocations or natural range expansions?\nAuthor: Statham, Mark J.; Sacks, Benjamin N.; Aubry, Keith B.; Perrine, John D.; Wisely, Samantha M.;\nSource: Journal of Mammalogy. 93(1): 52-65\nPublication Series: Scientific Journal (JRNL)\nDescription: Red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) are native to boreal and western montane portions of North America but their origins are unknown in many lowland areas of the United States. Red foxes were historically absent from much of the East Coast at the time of European settlement and did not become common until the mid-1800s. Some early naturalists described an apparent southward expansion of native foxes that coincided with anthropogenic habitat changes in the region. Alternatively, red foxes introduced from Europe during Colonial times may have become established in the east and subsequently expanded their range westward. The red fox also was absent historically from most lowland areas of the western United States. Extant populations of red foxes in those areas are considered to have arisen from intentional introductions from the east (and by extension are putatively European), escapes or releases from fur farms, or range expansions by native populations. To test these hypotheses we compared mitochondrial DNA sequences (cytochrome b and D-loop) from 110 individuals from 6 recently established populations to 327 native (primarily historical) individuals from Eurasia, Alaska, Canada, the northeastern United States, and montane areas in the western contiguous United States, and to 38 individuals from fur farms. We found no Eurasian haplotypes in North America, but found native haplotypes in recently established populations in the southeastern United States and in parts of the western United States. Red foxes from the southeastern United States were closely related to native populations in eastern Canada and the northeastern United States, suggesting that they originated from natural range expansions, not from translocation of European lineages, as was widely believed prior to this study. Similarly, recently established populations in the Great Basin and in western Oregon originated primarily from native populations in western montane regions, but also contained a few nonnative North American haplotypes. In contrast, populations in western Washington and southern California contained nonnative, highly admixed stock that clearly resulted from intracontinental translocations. Several common haplotypes in these populations originated in regions where fur-farm stocks originated. Although European red foxes translocated to the eastern United States during Colonial times may have contributed genetically to extant populations in that region, our findings suggest that most of the matrilineal ancestry of eastern red foxes originated in North America.\nKeywords: fur farm, mitochondrial DNA, museum samples, phylogeography, red fox, translocation, Vulpes vulpes\n- We recommend that you also print this page and attach it to the printout of the article, to retain the full citation information.\n- This article was written and prepared by U.S. Government employees on official time, and is therefore in the public domain.\nXML: View XML\nStatham, Mark J.; Sacks, Benjamin N.; Aubry, Keith B.; Perrine, John D.; Wisely, Samantha M. 2012.

The long, bushy tail makes up between 30 and 35 percent of its total length.\nOver the winter, the arctic fox has a heavy white coat, but during May, when the snow begins to melt, this coat is shed for a thinner, two-tone brown one. Within a few weeks the back, tail, and legs are dark brown and the remaining underparts are a buff colour. A small proportion of arctic foxes have a heavy, pale bluish-grey coat in winter, which becomes thinner and darker bluish-grey in summer. The blue coloration (blue fox) occurs in almost all populations, although the proportion tends to be higher in those animals living in marine areas that remain mostly ice-free during winter. In Canada, blue foxes seldom make up more than 5 percent of animals that are trapped, whereas in Greenland, for example, the proportion of blue foxes may reach 50 percent.\nSigns and sounds\nThe voice of the arctic fox is a sound rarely heard except during the breeding season. Courting foxes communicate with a barking yowl that may be heard over a great distance. Adults also yelp to warn their whelps, or pups, of danger and give a high-pitched undulating whine when disputing territorial claims with neighbouring foxes.\nHabitat and Habits\nThe wide distribution of this fox in the severe arctic environment is due to its excellent adaptation to cold and to a wide variety of foods.\nThe number of arctic foxes, especially in populations dependent upon lemmings for the major portion of their diet, fluctuates widely in relation to the abundance of lemmings. Although the fluctuations in lemming numbers, which occur every three to four years in North America, are not as well understood as those in Scandinavian countries, they are no less dramatic. Population size may vary ten or twentyfold between years, and hundredfold increases are not uncommon at a peak in the lemming cycle. During years when lemmings are plentiful, many foxes survive the long winter, a large proportion of the population breeds the following spring, and the litters are raised successfully. Hence a peak in the arctic fox cycle is recorded the following winter.\nA characteristic of the lemming cycle is the \"crash,\" the sudden decrease in population that may be caused by poor weather, lack of food, stress, predation, or a combination of these factors. Faced with a rapidly dwindling food supply, the arctic fox may be forced to abandon customary hunting areas and to travel, often hundreds of kilometres, in a nomadic search for food. Often many foxes travel in the same direction, and their movements are termed \"migrations.\" In Canada little is known about the direction of the migrations or the number of animals that may be involved; however, the intensity and scope of fox migrations in Russia is well known. During a lemming crash, fatigue, intense cold, and especially lack of food take their toll on the population, and many young foxes succumb.\nNative traplines, hunters, and diseases, such as rabies and mange, a skin disease caused by a parasite, also contribute to the population reduction. The following spring the remaining foxes are weak, a smaller proportion of the population breeds, and fewer breeding pairs raise all their whelps successfully. When the lemming population is low, the adult foxes often cannot meet the food demands of the growing litter. As a consequence, the adults may abandon the litter, leaving the whelps to starve to death, or the whelps may fight among themselves and kill each other, thereby reducing the food demands of the litter to a level that can be supplied by the adults.\nThe arctic fox lives in all the lands of the circumpolar Arctic. In Canada, it is found from the northern tip of Ellesmere Island to the southern tip of James Bay.\nBack to top\nThe diet of the arctic fox varies greatly from one part of its range to another. In the vast expanses of the continental tundra region, the arctic fox is almost entirely dependent on lemmings throughout the year. Only 5 to 10 percent of the summer diet consists of birds, eggs, ground squirrels, and berries. In winter, the fox continues its search for lemmings, which are active under the snow. Other winter food items include the meat caches, or hidden stores, of Inuit trappers, wolf kills, and food cached by the fox during summer.\nTo satisfy the food requirements of their whelps, or pups, adult arctic foxes living on the tundra hunt lemmings throughout the sunlit arctic summer night, from about 4:00 in the afternoon until 10:00 or 11:00 the following morning. Each adult usually conducts 10 to 15 hunts per night and brings back from three to eight lemmings per hunt. When lemmings are abundant the foxes hunt over an area of 2.5 to 5.0 km2. However, when food is scarcer, the adults probably range much further. Foxes capture the lemmings by digging them from their nests, which are located in soft peaty hummocks. In open tundra covered with low-lying or sparse vegetation, foxes capture active lemmings with a quick dash and a pounce. Lemmings detected in areas of low bush are pounced on as the fox slowly stalks through the bush.\nIn other areas, other rodents, such as ground squirrels and voles, are an important source of food, and during summer, adult birds, eggs, and flightless young also make up a large part of the diet. Arctic foxes that inhabit coastal regions also hunt for small marine animals, fish, and carrion, or flesh of dead animals, along shorelines. During winter, these foxes venture onto the sea ice, where they frequently trail polar bears for the remains of seal kills and seek out seal dens to capture the pups.\nFoxes living close to major seabird colonies raid nests for eggs and capture hundreds of birds, which they cache for food in winter. Some also search along lakeshores during June, hoping to flush a duck, goose, or shorebird from its nest and eat its eggs. Arctic foxes sometimes attack Sandhill Cranes and geese, but are seldom successful against such large prey.\nIn March or April, two months before the end of winter, arctic foxes begin to form mating pairs. Mating follows a long and playful period of courtship involving much active chasing and play-fighting. Throughout the females’ 51- to 57-day pregnancy, the pair remains together and finds a den for raising the whelps, or pups. Den sites are typically located on the tops or sides of eskers, which are ridges of coarse gravel, or on the tops of banks of lakes or rivers where the soil is sandy, dry, and stable. The den sites are usually free from snow earlier than the surrounding landscape because of the good drainage. Dens may be up to 300 years old and possess as many as 100 entrances. Before the birth of the whelps, both adults share the responsibility for cleaning out a portion of the den and digging one or more new entrances.\nLitters of arctic foxes are born between late May and early June. The average litter size is about 11 whelps. It is the largest litter recorded for any wild mammal in the world. Litters of up to 22 whelps have been recorded in Russia. At birth the whelps are blind, helpless, covered with hair, and weigh about 57 g.\nCompared to other canids, the male fox is probably one of the most attentive and best providers of food during the denning period. Just before the birth of the whelps and while the female is spending her time nursing and caring for the litter, the male hunts for food for her. After five to six weeks, when the whelps are weaned, the female begins to share the hunting duties with her mate and gradually provides well over half of the food to the growing litter. Although the amount of food provided by the male gradually decreases, he continues to bring food to the den site until the whelps begin to leave the den about 14 to 15 weeks after birth.\nThe large litter size and rapid growth of the whelps keep the adults busy hunting for food. An average litter of 11 whelps just starting to eat solid food requires about 30 lemmings or the equivalent in other food per day. The demand increases to over 100 lemmings per day just before the whelps leave the den. The adults and young consume about 3 500 to 4 000 lemmings during the denning period.\nAdult arctic foxes and their young have few enemies other than people. Wolves will eat a fox if they can catch one or find one caught in a trap. Where their ranges overlap, arctic foxes and red foxes Vulpes vulpes compete for den sites and hunting habitat along the sparsely treed southern fringes of the tundra. Golden Eagles may be a threat to young whelps at the den site, and barren ground grizzly bears and wolves are capable of digging whelps or adults from the den.\nIn Canada, the beautiful and valuable pelt of the arctic fox is an important source of income for northern native people. During the fur boom of the 1920s, the market value of arctic fox pelts was high, and arctic fox ranches were established. As new industries and ways of life have changed the Arctic, fox pelts have become less important to its economy. Few, if any, arctic fox ranches remain in Canada today. (Ranching is more common in Russia and Scandinavia, where the whelps are live-trapped at den sites and caged until their coat is prime.) Nonetheless the pelts still provide income to northern residents. On Banks Island, in the Northwest Territories, trapping for arctic foxes is actively pursued, and the harvest provides a prosperous living to trappers from the community of Sachs Harbour, on the southwest shore of Banks Island.\nThe only management controls on the arctic fox are the dates set for the trapping season. There are no restrictions on the number of foxes that may be trapped or the location of trapping areas. Surveys of important denning regions could be carried out to accurately estimate the trapping harvest and determine the abundance of arctic foxes. With decreasing trapping pressure, however, the abundance of lemmings serves as an indicator of arctic fox populations.\nMany tourists visit the North to see wildlife, and the arctic fox is one species that they have an excellent chance of observing. These attractive wild canines often visit campsites in search of food and activity. In the past, this has been both a welcome diversion and an inconvenience; for example, scientists who visited colonies where seabirds breed had to take precautions not only against the loss of food from their campsite, but also against leading the foxes, which eat both eggs and chicks, to the nests that they were studying.\nToday, as human activity in the Arctic increases, fox populations sometimes boom near garbage dumps and other artificial food sources. The risk of transmission of diseases, such as rabies, rises with the local population of foxes. Managers of fox populations seek to protect foxes against situations in which they become pests, by advising control of artificial food sources. They also point out the importance of protecting sufficient denning sites if the population is not to decline, and if wild foxes are to continue to range across the northern tundra.\nBanfield, A.W.F. 1974.

{"question":"What's the difference in how working capital financing and QSBS affect business ownership and control?","answer":"Working capital financing helps business owners maintain control of their company by providing short-term funding without requiring equity exchanges. It allows owners to avoid bringing in equity investors who would demand ownership stakes and decision-making power.

If you haven’t, you’ll want to keep reading for a brief overview of how this mere footnote can leave a big footprint on the tax burdens of small business investors.\nSection 1202 is the partial exclusion for gains from qualified small business stock.\nWhat is Qualified Small Business Stock?\nQualified Small Business Stock (QSBS), sometimes referred to as “section 1202 stock,” is an internal revenue code (IRC) exclusion that can eliminate capital gains tax for long-term investors and other shareholders of qualified small businesses.\nCertain businesses are not eligible for QSB status and in order to qualify, the business must be a domestic C corp and gross assets must never have exceeded $50 million in value after the passing of the Revenue Reconciliation act of 1993.\nThe partiality of the exclusion has changed significantly over time and stock acquired today will be eligible for 100% tax-exemption in five years — section 1202 should be renamed, “Whole exclusion for gains from qualified small business stock.”\nHere’s an overview of how this section of the tax code has evolved:\nQualified Small Business Stock Requirements\nIn order to qualify for the tax exemption of section 1202, the business and investors must meet certain requirements.\nWe’ve mentioned this already but it’s worth reiterating that the business must be incorporated as a C corp, and not another structure. Some industries, sectors, or businesses are not eligible for QSB status, including:\n- Trade or businesses performing services (health, law, accounting, consulting, financial services, brokerage services, performing arts, etc.)\n- Banking, insurance, financing, leasing, investing\n- Hotels, Restaurants, or similar services\nThis doesn’t mean you can simply incorporate and then five years from now write off 100% of your gains. The business must meet certain operating requirements as an active business for the entire duration of the taxpayer’s five years or more holding period.\nAn active business is one in which 80 percent or more of the assets are deployed in the day-to-day operations or research and development.\nThe investors too must meet certain requirements to be eligible for the QSBS tax exemption. For one thing, the stock must have been acquired at its issuance and in exchange for cash, property, or services rendered.\nThe investor must be an individual shareholder, not an institutional investor unless a qualified specialized small business investment company.\nTime-horizon is also a requirement for QSBS because the exemption does not go into effect until five years after the stock is issued.\nWhat QSBS Means for You\nIf you’re an individual investor, finding eligible small business investments that qualify can certainly offset future tax burdens. If you’re considering investing in a qualified small business stock offering, you should be extremely thoughtful about the strategy and stick to the plan.\nIf the company could grow in much greater excess of $50 million in value, you don’t want the situation where growth is being stifled to avoid disqualification, only to ultimately make the decision to grow outside the QSBS realm, and risk having purposely stunted the company’s growth.\nEither way, it’s worth modeling how much a QSBS return would be projected after tax and find the equivalent breakeven point in an investment that doesn ot qualify as a small business stock, and would therefore be taxed at the normal rate. Ultimately, a QSBS is an amazing section of the tax code for investors and entrepreneurs, but can also place a cap on your potential upside.","Best Working Capital Loans\nWorking capital loans for small businesses are one way to access quick and affordable financing. Business owners need to know what working capital is along with where they can secure a working capital loan for their financing needs.\nIf you run a small business, you know how vital it is to have enough cash on hand to pay bills, respond to unforeseen issues, take advantage of sudden business opportunities, and manage day-to-day expenses.\nWhether that means paying for an important marketing campaign, meeting payroll obligations, or paying for goods and services from vendors, having sufficient resources to do what is necessary to sustain and grow your business is a must. Each of these common finance issues among small businesses is covered by working capital.\nCash and other assets easily converted into cash are part of working capital. However, not all small businesses have available working capital lying around that can be used to cover what’s needed quickly.\nIn these scenarios, small businesses need to have options for working capital financing, often in the form of either a term loan or a business line of credit.\nThis guide offers insight into what working capital is, how it is acquired and the application process, and lenders that provide financing solutions to meet working capital needs.\nOn this page:\n- What is Working Capital?\n- How Can You Get Working Capital?\n- Lenders That Offer Working Capital Loans\n- How Do You Apply?\n- Difference Between a Small Business Loan & Working Capital Loan\nWhat is Working Capital?\nIn the simplest terms, working capital, sometimes referred to as net working capital, is the difference between current assets and current liabilities.\n- Current assets include accounts receivable, inventory of certain raw materials, finished goods, and of course cash on hand.\n- Current liabilities, on the other hand, are debts owed by the business that are due within the next 12 months.\nThis could mean accounts payable, salaries due to employees, or credit line payments to vendors or suppliers. The extent to which your current assets exceed your current liabilities is a measure of your business’s efficiency and short-term financial well-being.\nSecuring working capital through a loan allows you as the business owner to protect your own money. Instead of supplementing the business with your personal cash, a working capital loan provides short-term financing to help cover short-term needs. Also, having access to working capital provides a solution when cash flow is tight. Making payments to vendors on time, along with employee payroll and other debts are necessary to keep the business in good financial health for the long haul.\nHaving access to working capital allows you to steer clear of equity investors in your business. Some companies will seek out investors to help fund their business needs who ultimately inject capital into the business in exchange for ownership in the company.\nHowever, when this takes place, business owners forfeit some of their ownership stake in the business and the decision-making power that goes with it. Having enough working capital on hand eliminates this need. Some available funding and working capital lines of credit will only be available to established businesses, while other financial institutions will lend to new businesses. It’s important to find the right fit.\nHow Can You Get Working Capital?\nFortunately for small business owners, working capital can be acquired in several ways, including:\n- Working capital loans – these are the most common funding sources for short-term working capital needs, offered by a variety of small business lenders.\n- Merchant cash advance – working capital may also be available through a merchant cash advance in which a lender provides funds equal to daily or monthly credit card sales. The business then repays these funds with new card sales in the future.\n- Invoice financing and factoring – small businesses with outstanding invoices may sell these accounts for upfront cash. Invoice factoringcompanies then collect on the invoices as repayment from the business.\nEach method for receiving working capital outside what is currently available in the business comes with advantages and drawbacks of which business owners should be aware. It is always important to look at the costs, terms, and collateral needs for a working capital financing solution before signing on the dotted line.\nBest Lenders Offering Working Capital Loans\nSeveral lenders offer working capital loans to qualified businesses as a form of business credit, but each has a different set of eligibility criteria, interest rates, loan terms, and application processes.\nAs an online small business lender, Kabbage focuses on providing quick funding companies in need of short-term working capital for daily operations. With Kabbage, small businesses may apply for a loan amount between $2,000 and $250,000, with interest rates ranging from 24% to 99%.\nThe business must have an annual revenue of at least $50,000 to qualify, as well as at least one year in business. Kabbage is a good fit for small business owners who are willing to provide a personal guarantee, those who have less than perfect credit, or businesses that want fast working capital funding.\nAnother online lender offering working capital loans is OnDeck. The finance company provides working capital loans to small businesses that have been in business at least one year and have annual revenue of no less than $100,000. The working capital loans from OnDeck can range from $5,000 up to $500,000, with interest rates as low as 16.7%.\nOnDeck is best for small businesses with strong cash flow and those that do not mind a relatively short repayment term.\nA newer entrant to the small business lending market, StreetShares is a viable option for some small businesses with working capital needs. The online lender provides working capital loans to businesses in amounts ranging from $2,000 to $250,000 and interest rates ranging from 9% to 40%. Businesses must have annual revenue of at least $75,000 and be established for at least one year to qualify.\nStreetShares may require a personal guarantee from the business owner, as well as a minimum credit score of 600. This online lender is best suited for small businesses that want lower interest rates on working capital loans who have strong credit and steady cash flow from the business.\nHow Do You Apply for Working Capital Loans?\nThe application process for securing a working capital loan is not much different from any other small business financing application. Businesses need to provide the following information in order to show the lender they are a good fit for borrowing short-term funding:\n- Business owner’s social security number\n- The small business EIN or tax identification number\n- Recent bank account statements for the business\n- Recent personal and business federal tax returns\n- Financial statements like profit and loss statements or balance sheet\n- Cash flow details for the past several months\n- Outstanding business debts\nThis information is provided to a working capital lender either in person or online, and then it is reviewed in depth. Lenders want to know that businesses have the capacity to repay working capital loans in a timely fashion.\nIf business or personal financials are not strong, a working capital loan may require collateral to secure the loan or a personal guarantee from the business owner that promises repayment from personal assets. Once the lender feels confident in the small business’s ability to repay the loan, funds are deposited into the business bank account and can be used.\nDifference Between a Small Business Loan & Working Capital Loan\nWorking capital loans are beneficial to small business owners in need of financing because of the inherent differences they have from small business loans.\nWith a working capital loan, business owners have far more flexibility in what the loan proceeds may be used to cover. Items like payroll, overhead of the business, vendor payments, and inventory may be covered with a working capital loan. In many cases, small business loans are more specific. A business owner has less flexibility to pay for what is needed if it falls outside the reason for the small business loan, as listed on the application.\nAdditionally, working capital loans are much faster than small business loans as far as the application process and approval. However, working capital loans also have much shorter repayment terms than small business loans. Most working capital lenders require full repayment within six to 12 months, while small business loans may extend up to three or five years. Because of the shorter repayment timeframe and the fast access to cash, working capital loans may also have higher costs, including the interest rate, compared to small business loans.\nIt is important for business owners to consider their options for financing, including working capital and small business loans, before making a decision."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:748b0152-9809-43cf-b3d0-1548b6bf1dad>","<urn:uuid:9d641d5d-46bd-4839-8fd6-98a547088f03>"],"error":null}

Both Micro, NC and Mountain Home, AR suggest monitoring sediment levels and taking action if sedimentation becomes apparent. They recommend evaluating the pond's water source to identify if exposed banks or upstream activities are causing increased sediment.

This web page goes over several of the crucial elements of a typical fish pond that need to be recognized and also evaluated prior to tackling pond management issues.\nAn important very first step in evaluating your fish pond is to identify the primary purposes for your pond as well as recognize the limitations this will put on other usages. Ponds are regularly used in numerous methods to satisfy more than one objective. As an example, having water available in the pond for fire defense might satisfy one purpose without interfering or contravening various other purposes such as swimming or angling. Multiple usage ponds are great as long as the uses are compatible. When conflicting or incompatible usages are preferred, it is essential to designate priorities to the proprietor’s objectives. As an example, the objective of attending to swimming might clash directly with the objective of having water readily available for watering. Irrigation requirements may lower the water level to a factor where swimming is impossible, at a time when swimming is most wanted. For this reason, you should provide and prioritize certain objectives for your fish pond. Analyzing the fish pond sources is a crucial component of setting objectives. Via inspection and evaluation of the fish pond structure, landmark, water sources, as well as ecology, you can insure that the pond sources suffice for your goals.\nMany fish pond uses and monitoring techniques will call for an understanding of the local North Carolina fish pond landmark and also sources of water. The pond watershed consists of the area of land bordering the fish pond that adds water to it. Recognizing the fish pond landmark is necessary since anything that happens within this location could impact the pond. Locating a fish pond in an undisturbed area or minimizing disturbance and also land make use of changes within the pond landmark are very important components of securing a fish pond.\nLots of fish ponds have actually been created where groundwater comes to the surface area as springtimes or seeps. Ponds fed by these groundwater resources could remain cooler during the summer especially if the flow from the springtimes is persistent. If possible, the land area adding water to the springs ought to be recognized and also shielded to make sure adequate amount and quality of water for the pond.\nSometimes ponds are built on or near a surface area stream. The stream might merely stream through a created fish pond or a part of the stream could be diverted into the fish pond. In this local Micro case, the fish pond’s health and wellness relies totally on the quality and amount of stream water. The entire acreage draining the surface stream ends up being essential to the wellness of the fish pond.\nWhere North Carolina groundwater or streams are not available, a pond may lie to capture surface area drainage from the surrounding land. Surface area overflow ponds are generally located in clinical depressions often draining pipes 10 to 20 acres of land for a one acre fish pond. Land usage activities around these ponds is specifically essential considering that water moves straight over the land to the pond.

{"question":"How big was the extinct Great Elephant Bird of Madagascar compared to modern birds?","answer":"The Great Elephant Bird was massive, weighing at least 1,000 pounds, which is more than three times the weight of an Ostrich. It produced enormous eggs with a capacity of 2 gallons, equivalent to seven Ostrich eggs, 180 chicken eggs, or 12,000 hummingbird eggs.","context":["Madagascar and other Islands\nHuman Settlers Invade Paradise About 500 A.D., immigrant people from Asia, most probably Indonesia or Malaysia, arrived on Madagascar's shores in hand-hewn canoes, bringing domestic animals with them. They began clearing forests and burning them for farmland, and turned lakes and wetlands into rice paddies. Cleared land produced crops for only a few years until the thin soil became sterile. Farmers then moved on to other parts of the forest, in this slash-and-burn agriculture. At some point, African herdsmen colonized the island, bringing zebu cattle, which crowded out wildlife (Tyson 2000). Gradually, abuse of the land eroded the soil in the central highlands to bare earth, pocketed and gouged by deep gullies and cavernous holes. This region had harbored a great variety of lemurs, along with a wealth of birds, reptiles and unique plants. Throughout the island, wildlife declined as habitats disappeared, isolating animals in smaller and smaller patches of forest and wetlands. The large lemurs, tortoises and elephant birds were avidly hunted.\nWithin 600 years of the arrival of the Malagasy, extinctions claimed many native animals. Several elephant bird species, the larger lemurs and many native plants vanished. Two kinds of pygmy hippos inhabited the island. The Madagascar Hippopotamuses (Hippopotamus lemerlei), an amphibious species, and Hippopotamus madagascariensis, a forest species, were both about 6.5 feet long and 2.5 feet tall, smaller than the Common Hippopotamus of Africa, which is about 10 feet long (Tyson 2000). From genetic and anatomical analysis, both seem to have evolved from the latter species (Tyson 2000). The hippos had been widely distributed and very common prior to the arrival of the Malagasy (Dewar 1984). Their bones have been found with marks indicating that they had been butchered (Tyson 2000). Both died out long before Europeans arrived. The native crocodile, whose large bones have been found, is believed by some scientists to represent large specimens of Nile Crocodiles, the species native today (Tyson 2000). It is thus possible that the crocodile survived. A large mongoose-like viverrid, Cryptoprocta spelea, and a very unusual aardvark-like animal, Plesiorycteropus madagascariensis, died out at an early date (Dewar 1984).\nPrior to the arrival of humans, elephant birds had been abundant in most parts of the island, as attested by the prevalence of their bones. There were two genera, and from six to 12 species of these birds (Tyson 2000). It is likely that the flightless birds fell prey to the primitive weapons of the Malagasy and were crowded out of their habitats by livestock (Tyson 2000). The last to die out was the Great Elephant Bird (Aepyornis maximus), which may have survived until recent times by retreating to remote swamps. Dr. Alexander Wetmore of the Smithsonian Institution examined bones of a Great Elephant Bird unearthed in archeological excavations in the 1960s. He was amazed by their size: \"The incredible femur, or thighbone, of this ponderous bird is by far the largest I have ever seen\" (Wetmore 1967). Estimated to weigh at least 1,000 pounds, more than three times the weight of an Ostrich, it produced eggs larger than any dinosaur's, with a capacity of 2 gallons (equivalent to seven Ostrich eggs), 180 chicken eggs or 12,000 hummingbird eggs (Bradbury 1919, Fuller 1987). When one was X‑rayed, the bones of an embryo three‑fourths developed were revealed (Wetmore 1967). Something had interrupted the embryo's growth and frozen it within the eggshell for hundreds and perhaps thousands of years (Wetmore 1967).\nDespite its fearsome size, the Great Elephant Bird lacked a hooked beak for tearing prey and was plainly not a predator (Wetmore 1967). Its large, clawed feet may have helped it defend itself against the small native predators but were not enough to protect it from Malagasy arrows. Its short legs prevented it from running as fast as its relative, the Ostrich, but it may have been quite agile when chased. This vegetarian bird browsed and cropped plants, able to reach with its long neck to the lower branches of trees (Wetmore 1967). By the mid-16th century, when Europeans had managed to establish a foothold in Madagascar, the new French Governor, Sieur Etienne de Flacourt, wrote in 1661 that the Great Elephant Bird was still found in the south of the island, \"seeking the most deserted places\" to avoid human hunters (Tyson 2000). Villagers of Antandroy told of an Ostrich-like bird that was difficult to catch, according to Flacourt (Tyson 2000).\nThe exact date this giant bird became extinct is not known with certainty. Alan Feduccia (1996), an eminent paleo-ornithologist, asserts that elephant birds of many species were still widespread in the 10th century but gradually disappeared as a result of human activity. He cites an account by a French merchant sailor in 1848, who visited Madagascar and saw the shell of the Great Elephant Bird; he was told that it belonged to the chief and that the bird that produced such eggs \"is still more rarely seen\" (Feduccia 1996). Some authorities estimate that it died out in the mid-17th century, although there is no proof that any European ever saw one of these birds (Tyson 2000). It has been suggested that Europeans were responsible for the bird’s extinction by hunting and destroying its habitat (Quammen 1996). But Thomas Brooks (2000) of the Center for Applied Biodiversity Science, Conservation International, asserted in a list of extinct birds in Threatened Birds of the World (BI 2000) that all the elephant birds had disappeared by 1500. In a bizarre footnote to this species' epitaph, an Aepyornis egg washed up on Australia's western coast in 1995. No conclusive explanation for this strange event has been put forth, although it is likely that it became unearthed from long interment by rains, and washed out to sea. Much less is known of the other species of elephant birds, which existed in a variety of sizes down to a chicken-sized species.\nLemur-like primates once lived on many continents, but nowhere had they evolved into such a great variety of species. When the Malagasy people arrived some 1,500 years ago, lemurs occupied every habitat, even marshland. A species as tall as a man must have startled the Malagasy immigrants, giving rise to legends that these animals had superhuman powers. The first French naturalists were told by the Malagasy that these primates were thought to be the ghosts of sacred ancestors of man, inspiring the genus name Lemur, the word for ghost in Latin. The Malagasy considered some lemurs sacred and punished anyone who harmed them, but most species were feared as evil demons and were killed on sight.\nFrom their arrival on Madagascar, the Malagasy hunted the larger species of lemurs, almost all of which are now extinct. Archaeological excavations show that they formed a staple in the immigrants' diets. Such diggings have unearthed the skulls and bones of long‑extinct lemurs in early Malagasy jars and kitchen middens; their heads had been split by ax-heads made from an extinct flightless bird (Jolly 1980).\nIn the centuries following colonization by the Malagasy immigrants, some 15 species of lemurs of eight genera became extinct (Mittermeier 1997). These extinct lemurs were, for the most part, far larger than surviving species and had evolved to fill many ecological niches. Three Megaladapis lemurs weighed between 90 and 170 pounds and moved slowly through the trees, feeding on foliage (Tattersall 1993). Another species, Archaeolemur, was about the size of a female baboon and lived on the ground (Tattersall 1993). Two Palaeopropithecus species weighed between 90 and 130 pounds and were sloth‑like tree dwellers with flexible bodies (Tattersall 1993). These extinct lemurs had evolved many unusual means of movement and locomotion that have no parallels in living species of lemurs.\nLargest of all, the massive 400‑pound Archaeoindris was apparently a ground‑dweller, moving on all fours; many of its anatomical characteristics are unlike any living primate (Tattersall 1993). One entire lemur family, Archaeolemuridae, was obliterated. In this family were many species of lemurs weighing between 35 and 55 pounds; they were powerfully built and short‑legged (Tattersall 1993). The heaviest lemur surviving today, the Indri (Indri indri), weighs only about 15 pounds (Tattersall 1993). These lemurs had survived for millions of years, and their extinctions were indeed a major biological loss to the planet. According to primatologists, the surviving lemurs resemble the very earliest primates from the Eocene (Tattersall 1993). Like prosimians in Africa and Asia, but to a far greater degree, lemurs have a highly developed sense of smell. Some species have long, fox-like noses (Preston-Mafham 1991). Genetic analysis of their DNA has revealed that all lemurs are descended from a single ancestor that probably arrived from Africa about 60 million years ago (Garbutt 1999).\nThe Giant Aye-aye (Daubentonia robusta) lemur was somewhat larger and 2.5 to 5 times heavier than the surviving Aye-aye (see below), but in other respects was very similar (Garbutt 1999). It is known from subfossil remains found in southwestern Madagascar (Nowak 1999). The date of its disappearance is unknown but may be fairly recent.\nArchaeologists have uncovered remains of a massive bird of prey, the Malagasy Crowned Eagle (Stephanoaetus mahery), which undoubtedly preyed on lemurs (Feduccia 1996). In fact, at one locality the diet of this eagle, based on the bones of eagles and lemurs found together, contained at least 80 percent primates, including specimens weighing up to 26.5 pounds (Feduccia 1996). Remains of another large eagle of the genus Aquila have been discovered, and it, too, preyed on large lemurs and became extinct after the arrival of the Malagasy. These extinct birds preyed on smaller lemurs as well, including some species still surviving (Feduccia 1996). A bird of prey flying overhead still elicits fear in lemurs, causing them to seek cover. Neither of the two remaining species of eagles on Madagascar preys on lemurs, but two hawk species have been seen preying on young lemurs (Garbutt 1999).\nIn addition to the Giant Elephant Bird, the large Snail-eating Coua (Coua delalandei), a member of the cuckoo family, became extinct. The last specimen of this large, slate-blue bird was taken on an islet off the east coast, Ile Sainte-Marie, in 1834 (Morris and Hawkins 1998); reports by observers who claimed to have seen the bird were recorded as late as 1930 (Fuller 1987). The causes of this bird's disappearance, and even its exact range, remain obscure (Langrand 1990). Many specimens of this bird were taken before its extinction and kept in museums in Leiden; London; New York; Paris; Philadelphia; Tananarive (Madagascar); and Cambridge (Massachusetts) (Fuller 1987). The long feathers of this bird were highly valued by the Malagasy, and hunting may have reduced its numbers to a critically low level (Fuller 1987). It is also possible that the many birds killed for zoological specimens may have pushed this already rare bird to extinction, since its distribution may have been limited to the tiny Ile Sainte-Marie. No reliable record exists of its presence on the main island of Madagascar, but there is hope that it might be found in lowland forest near the Bay of Antongil (Morris and Hawkins 1998). Ten closely related species of couas survive, all smaller than the Snail-eating Coua."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7fef3e46-708e-4ee6-9970-39e6cb92b5f3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do different materials and liquids play in egg-based experiments, and how do these experiments demonstrate both scientific principles and dental health concepts?","answer":"Different materials and liquids play crucial roles in egg-based experiments that demonstrate multiple scientific principles. In one experiment, vinegar dissolves the egg's calcium carbonate shell, while water and corn syrup demonstrate osmosis effects on the egg membrane. For dental health demonstrations, various liquids like water, dark-colored drinks (cola/coffee), and light-colored drinks (apple juice) are used to show different degrees of staining on eggshells, which parallel their effects on tooth enamel. These experiments require specific quantities of materials - 150mL of each liquid for staining tests, and materials like table salt, vinegar, and corn syrup for other experiments. The outcomes help explain both scientific concepts and practical dental hygiene implications.","context":["Math + Science + FUN!\nAs discussed in math class before Spring Break, students are to pick a science fair project or experiment that interests them. The project/experiment can be as simple or as complex as they wish. Set up your experiment carefully, following the step by step process of the scientific method. Record your results and complete your experiment multiple times, logging your data each time. Once you have completed your experiment at least 5 times, you can “do the math” and tally all of your data.\nThis is where you merge the math assignment from Mrs. Raynor with this assignment. Your data will show ratios and percentages. Math + Science = FUN! (Hint—complete the experiment 10X and your math project becomes simple!) You may present your final project in any form you choose. (Example: written report, video, poster board, photos, interpretative dance, etc.)\nHere is a silly review of the scientific method we learned about at the beginning of school:\nThere are a plethora of resources out there, full of exciting ideas.

Review how to separate egg whites from the yolk and why certain recipes require just the egg whites. Write your findings below or restate them to your parents.\nEggRoll: Activity #1\n— (1) boiled and (1) raw egg (make sure both eggs appear similar on the outside)\n— (1) Tbsp table salt\n— (1-2) cup(s) of white vinegar\n— (1) cup of corn syrup\n- Have someone place both eggs on a flat surface without you touching them. Make sure they mix the two eggs up so you do not know which one is which.\n- Have your assistant give both eggs a good spin.\n- Once both eggs are spinning and twirling, stop both eggs with your hands and quickly let go. One egg should mysteriously spring back into a spin.\n- List your observations below and consider what a liquid and solid interior could do to the egg’s motions.\n- Now, turn your attention to the other egg. (the egg that didn’t start spinning again when stopped) Get this egg to turn very, very fast. Write your observations below.\nEgg #1 Observations:\nEgg #2 Observations:\nWhat do you think happened to each egg and why? How does the liquid interior change the spinning of the egg?

Record your observations below.\n- Carefully pour out the old vinegar and add fresh vinegar over the egg, cover it with plastic wrap and leave it alone for 24 more hours.\n- On the third day, carefully spoon out the egg and rinse it under tap water. Can you see the thin opaque membrane? Record your observations below.\n- Now, soak your naked egg in a cup of water overnight. This step is a great example of how osmosis occurs.\n- Finally, place your egg in a cup of corn syrup and observe what happens to the egg. Record all of your observations below.\nObservations after 24 hours in vinegar:\n48 hours in vinegar:\nObservations after soaking in H20:\nAfter soaking in corn syrup:\nWhy does the egg’s shell dissolve when submerged in vinegar? What are the bubbles you observed when the egg is first placed in the vinegar? The answer is a gas. What gas do you think is being released? How did the process of osmosis change the egg? Corn syrup? Can you see a small white dot inside the yellow yolk? If so, you have found the cell’s nucleus. An egg is a great example of a single cell with a membrane and a nucleus.\nConsider: Does temperature change the rate that the acidity of the vinegar dissolves the egg’s calcium carbonate shell?

We have explored our skeletal and muscle systems. We have also used exercise to learn more about how our bodies work. We have also discovered how nutrition plays a vital role in how well our bodies perform. We looked at the different types of food sources and how they provide our bodies with different types of fuel and nutrients to keep us healthy. My goal for this year was for you learn the basic bones and muscles of the body, along with the basic nutrients that support a healthy lifestyle.\nBefore my surgery and our spring break, we began to discuss the body’s muscular system. We will briefly review the main muscles of the body, what bones they support, and how they work. Please review your notes from class and add the information you learn from the links and pictures in this lesson.\nAssignment Due 4/14/2020\nReview and memorize main muscles of the human body.","Revised March 2013\nBy: Anna Goldblatt, Sheridan Samberson, and Nicki Diamond | Coppell High School, Coppell | Grade Level: Elementary School | March 19 2013\nIn this experiment, students use eggs as a model to determine which liquids stain teeth the most. Even though eggs are not an exact representation of teeth, the similarities in coatings of an egg and a tooth make staining between them comparable.\nEnamel is the visible tissue of the tooth where it covers the anatomical crowning and the nerve. Enamel consists of minerals that protect the tooth. The different amounts of minerals in enamel contribute to the strength as well as the brittleness of the tooth. Enamel is avascular, meaning it has no blood flow and it is not renewable, so keeping the teeth clean is vital. Drinking liquids with high acid and sugar contents, such as colas or fruit juices, should be done in moderation because staining and decay can occur. This makes the process for rejuvenating the tooth very hard. The usual color of enamel is a very light yellow to a grayish white.\nEggshells are similar to tooth enamel. They share the same coloring, ranging from a light yellow to white. In addition, the eggshell protects the egg from breaking, just as tooth enamel protects the tooth from decaying.\nUsing eggshells as a model for teeth, students examine the extent of staining caused by three different liquids.\nA dark-colored liquid will stain the enamel on an egg more than water will.\nTotal actual in-class time: 45 minutes\nSet-up time: 10 minutes\nExperiment’s run time: 30 minutes\nTake-down time: 5 minutes\nMaterials (per group of students)\n- Beakers (3)\n- Light-colored drink (for example, apple juice) (150 mL; $1)\n- Dark-colored drink (for example, a cola or coffee) (150 mL; $1)\n- Water (150 mL)\n- Eggs (3; <$1)\n- Labels for marking beakers\n- Label the three beakers: A. control (water), B. light-colored drink, C. dark-colored drink.\n- Fill each beaker with 150 mL of the appropriate liquid.\n- Gently place one egg into each of the beakers.\n- Set the timer to 30 minutes and press start.\n- After the 30 minutes are up, remove the eggs from the beakers.\n- Observe the eggs, noting any changes in coloration.\n- Record these observations in Table 1.\n- Clean up the lab.\nData Analysis and Questions to Consider\n- How do the colors of the eggs differ from one another after soaking in the different liquids?\n- Over time, how do you think your teeth will hold up to the different liquids you drink? Which type of liquids do you think will be best for you?\n- How could this apply to your dental hygiene, and what have you learned from it to help maintain a healthy mouth?\nDescribe what you concluded from your observations.\n- To prevent the egg from breaking, you can prepare hard-boiled eggs for your students.\n- To minimize cost, buy one carton of a dozen eggs and split the class into four groups.\n- Make sure you and your students handle the eggs carefully!\n- When choosing the liquids, make sure there is enough for your class and be aware of your budget.\n- A way to introduce the lab is to talk about dental health and the importance of keeping teeth clean.

{"question":"Can family see body after organ donation vs education donation?","answer":"For organ donation in hospitals, families can say goodbye before and after the donation procedure, and can have a viewing since doctors carefully preserve the body's appearance with hidden stitches. However, for educational whole body donation, a viewing or traditional funeral is not allowed due to time constraints for preserving the body. In both cases, families can still arrange a cremation or burial afterward.","context":["If you donate organs and tissues after death, you can help persons who are very sick. They can keep living if they receive a donor kidney or liver. And thanks to the eye tissue of a donor, they can see again. In the Netherlands, more than 1,000 persons are on an organ waiting list. About 150 individuals die every year while waiting for an organ. A deceased donor donates three organs on average, so that every year these organ donors save the lives of about 800 persons. One would think that this takes care of everyone on the waiting list, but that is not the case. The waiting list just keeps getting longer.\nNo, not everyone can donate their organs or tissues after death. A doctor will assess upon your death whether your organs or tissues are suitable for donation.\nBut what everyone can do is specify their choice in the Donor registry – even if you are sick, sometimes even if you have (or have had) cancer, have received a blood transfusion or are taking medications. It is always a good thing to specify your choice. An organ or tissue that is damaged by disease or medication can sometimes become ineligible for transplantation, but other organs or tissues may still be suitable.\nThings can also change in the future, as medical science is able to solve more issues. While today you may not able to donate because of a disease, in a few years that same disease may no longer constitute a problem.\nYes, you can. You can donate if you are sick or taking medications. Upon your death, the doctor will assess which organs or tissues can still be used for a patient. Sometimes organs or tissues are no longer suitable for transplantation, for instance due to damage or disease, but other organs or tissues may still be suitable for transplantation.\nNo, you yourself cannot decide who gets your organs or tissues after your death. That is stipulated by law. One reason for it is that in the Netherlands, everyone must be able to get the same level of healthcare. This is why you cannot be the one determining who you will or will not donate to. An organ goes to the patient on the waiting list who needs it most urgently, and who is the best fit for the organ.\nEveryone can specify their choice in the Donor registry. Whether you are homosexual or heterosexual makes no difference, so you may be eligible to donate organs.\nYes, even if you have an unhealthy lifestyle, it can be helpful to give a ‘yes’ in the Donor registry. A person on the waiting list for a new organ can die if the organ does not arrive on time. Lungs of a smoker may be better than the person’s own lungs, and the liver of a drinker can sometimes help a liver patient. So if you smoke or drink, it doesn’t necessarily mean you cannot donate your organs. What is important is that the organ still be suitable for transplantation. A doctor will properly assess this in advance.\nOrgan and tissue donation can be done from birth to old age. A doctor will assess the suitability of every organ or tissue. Skin donation is only possible from age 20. The heart of an 80-year-old is generally no longer suitable for donation, but that person may still be able to donate kidneys.\nYes, all the organs and tissues that you can donate are listed on the Donor form. You may want to donate some organs and tissues but not others. You can specify this on the form.\nOrgan donation can only be done when people die at the hospital, for example because of a severe stroke or an accident. In this way, a person may be able to donate organs after their death. Authorisation is always needed from the donor or from their family. Only when it is certain that a patient is going to die, does a doctor take a look in the Donor registry to see the choices that were made.\nDid you give a ‘yes’ in the Donor registry? Or has your family said ‘yes’? Only then can the hospital start the testing. The physicians may take an ECG or blood tests, and ensure that the body stays at the right temperature. Organ donation can take between 10 and 24 hours, sometimes even longer. Did you give a ‘no’ in the Donor registry? Then there will be no donation and no testing.\nDonation of tissues works out more often than donation of organs. In such cases it doesn’t matter whether you die at home or at the hospital. Special teams harvest the tissues at a hospital or another suitable space, following strict rules.\nAfter a patient dies, a doctor takes a look in the Donor registry to see the choices that were made. Have you not specified a choice? In that case, your family will decide about donation. Has permission been given for donation? In that case, the doctor will report the donor to the Dutch Transplant Foundation, and the donation process will get started. Altogether, tissue donation takes between 8 and 28 hours.\nAfter your death, you can donate the following organs and tissues:\nOrgans: liver, heart, lungs, pancreas, small intestines, kidneys\nTissues: eye tissue, heart valves, large vessels, skin, bone, cartilage and tendons\nThe chances are not that large. Organ donation is quite exceptional and does not happen often. How come? An organ donor must always die at the intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital and be receiving artificial respiration, and the organs must still be suitable for transplantation.\nIn 2018, 273 persons gave organs after their death. Every year, about 153,000 people die. This means that the chances of becoming an organ donor are 1 in 560.\nDefinitely. Organs and tissues are only harvested when doctors are 100% sure that a person has died. Death is diagnosed according to strict rules, and this is done by several physicians.\nDonation and family\nNo. Family cannot change your choice just like that. The doctor will almost always honour the choice you made in the Donor registry. That is what you wanted. If there is a very good reason, a doctor may decide differently.\nAn organ or tissue donation must be done with the utmost care, so it takes time. Altogether, organ donation can take between 10 and 24 hours, sometimes even longer.\nThe time between diagnosing brain death and harvesting organs is between 4 and 12 hours. If the heart and blood circulation have stopped, there is less time. As soon as blood is no longer circulating through the body, organs quickly become less suitable for transplantation. This is why harvesting of organs begins quickly after death is diagnosed.\nIf the body of a tissue donor is refrigerated within six hours, tissues can still be harvested for transplantation up to 24 hours after death. The tissue donation procedure can thus last between 8 and 28 hours.\nCertainly. There is always someone for the family at the hospital. During the entire duration of the donation process, a hospital staff member (such as the transplant coordinator) will be in touch with the family.\nYes. Removing organs and tissues is always done with great care. Doctors consider it very important for a donor to look presentable after the operation. They do not remove anything from places that are visible when a body is viewed. Stitches with bandages are applied on operated areas.\nYes, there is always time to say goodbye. Family can be with the donor before and after the donation. After the donation procedure, the family itself determines what happens with their loved one. The family can also choose the viewing location, at a funeral centre or at home.\nYes, you can. A funeral or cremation can take place on the day chosen by the family and does not need to be postponed because of the organ or tissue donation.\nNo, there are no costs involved. The family of the donor doesn’t pay anything for donation.\nDonation and religion\nDonation and religion can be compatible. Most faiths approve of organ donation. If you have any doubts about this, it is important that you discuss it with someone – perhaps a pastor, an imam or someone else knowledgeable about your religion – so that you can arrive at a joint perspective about organ and tissue donation.\nYou can only be included in the Donor registry if you yourself specified your choice in the Donor registry. Anyone from the age of 12 can specify their choice in the Donor registry. There are four choices:\nChoice 1: Yes, I grant permission\nYou want to become a donor. You can donate the following organs: pancreas, intestines, heart, liver, lungs and kidneys;\nand the following tissues: blood vessels, bone, heart valves, cartilage, tendons, skin and eye tissue.\nYou may want to donate some organs and tissues but not others. You can specify this on the form.\nChoice 2: No, I do not grant permission\nYou do not want to become a donor.\nChoice 3: My partner or family will decide\nUpon your death, your partner or family are allowed to make the choice.\nChoice 4: The person I have appointed will decide\nYou want someone else to decide for you after your death.\nEveryone in the Netherlands will receive information from the government about the new law.\nIf after 1 July 2020, you still haven’t specified a choice in the Donor registry, you will receive a letter asking whether you want to specify your choice.\nIf you do not specify anything after the first letter, you will receive a reminder after six weeks.\nIf again you do not specify anything, ‘No objection against organ donation’ will be listed under your name. You will get another letter to confirm this. ‘No objection against organ donation’ means that your organs can go to a patient after your death.\nIt remains important that you yourself specify a choice about organ donation. If you have already done so, your choice will remain valid.\nThe choices are the same as in the current law. Something will change only if you haven’t made a choice yet. Nothing changes even after you receive a letter after 1 July 2020 in which you are asked to specify a choice.\nIf you do not specify a choice in the Donor registry, ‘No objection against organ and tissue donation’ will appear under your name. This means that your organs can go to a patient after your death. The doctor at the hospital will discuss this with your family. If your family is very sure and can explain to the doctor that you really did not want to be a donor, then you will not be a donor. It is therefore very important for your partner and family to know what your choice is, and especially for you yourself to specify it.\nIt is important for you to specify in the Donor registry whether you do or do not want to become a donor. You can specify this choice in three different ways:\nWhen it comes to organ and tissue donation, a person must be able to understand what it is about. The person must also be able to understand the consequences of the choice they make. If the person cannot do that, then they are legally incapable for organ donation.\nAt present, a legally incapable person cannot be a donor. That will change when the new donor law goes into effect on 1 July 2020.\nWhen an organ or tissue is harvested, a doctor can discover that it is not suitable for transplantation after all, for instance because the quality of the organ or tissue is not good enough or because an unexpected damage or disease is found. In such cases, the organ can be used for scientific research. Through this research, physicians learn more about transplantation. This is different than donating your entire body to science.\nSince 1 October 2019, the donor pass is no longer issued. A doctor is not going to look for your pass when you pass away; a doctor is obliged to search the Donor Register, where your choice is registered. For that reason, the donor pass is no longer sent together with a confirmation of the registration.","Who May Donate?\nUAMS has a need for anatomical donations to provide our students with the best possible education; however, we do not solicit anatomical donations. Anyone who is of sound mind, and at least eighteen years of age, or the legal next of kin or POA of a potential donor can apply for our program. Even after death, legal next of kin or Powers Of Attorney may make an anatomical gift on behalf of the decedent (A.C.A. 20-17-1209).\nIs There A Difference Between This Program And Organ Donor Programs?\nYes! This program has no association with organ donor programs — this program deals specifically with donating the entire body.\nMay I Donate To Organ Bank Programs Before My Body Is Accepted By The AGP?\nThe only organ bank donation allowed is the cornea. For this you may contact the Arkansas Lions Eye Bank & Laboratory at 4301 W. Markham (Slot 523), Little Rock, AR 72205-7199, by email at email@example.com, or call 501-686-8388 or 501-666-3937. They will provide you with the necessary information.\nUnfortunately, no other organ donations are allowed. The procedures involved in removal of such organs are extensive enough to interrupt the blood vessels in such a fashion that it is not possible to achieve the type of embalming necessary for carrying out future anatomical studies.\nAre There Cases In Which A Body Is Not Acceptable For Anatomical Donation?\nYes. The AGP may decline a donor who may not be suitable for educational purposes. There are a number of situations that may lead to either a previously enrolled anatomical donor or a potential anatomical donor not being accepted, including:\n- Highly contagious diseases at the time of death, such as hepatitis\n- Deceased with advanced decomposition\n- Previously embalmed or autopsied bodies\n- Bodies more than moderately overweight (>250 lbs.) Or emaciated\n- Height greater than 6’4”\n- Extensive injury to the body or internal organs (e.g., motor vehicle accident, cancer, severe deformity)\n- Minor under 18 years old\nIf the UAMS Anatomical Gift Program determines that the body is unusable for these or other reasons, survivors will need to make other arrangements for the body’s final disposition. UAMS will not be responsible for any costs associated with other arrangements.\nWill My Family Or I Be Paid For The Donation Of My Body?\nNo. United States Laws specifically prohibit paying persons for human bodies or internal organs. The UAMS Anatomical Donation Program is a “Whole Body” program that follows both state and federal legislation (i.e., Revised Arkansas Anatomical Gift Act and Revised Uniform Anatomical Gift Act ([A.C.A. 20-17-1201 et. Seq]).\nWhat Expenses Will My Family Or I Have To Pay?\nThere are no costs incurred for the AGP at UAMS. If death occurs at one’s home or in a hospital without a morgue, a local funeral home must be contacted to pick up and hold the body in cold storage. The funeral home will charge the family for any services performed. Under certain circumstances, if death occurs in a hospital with an in-house morgue, the body may simply be placed in the morgue. In this case the family will bear no expenses.\nWhat About A Viewing Or Funeral Upon My Death?\nThe UAMS AGP must be notified immediately so that pick up of donor can be as soon as possible. Due to the fact that we are on a time restraint, a viewing or traditional funeral will not be allowed if you or your loved one are whole body donors.\nWhat Happens To My Body After Studies Are Completed?\nDonor remains are cremated at an Arkansas state licensed crematory. After cremation, if it is requested that we do so, the ashes (cremains) will be returned to the family. Otherwise, the ashes will be buried in the Forest Hills Cemetery, Alexander, Arkansas.\nThere may be an occasion when the donation provides a unique educational opportunity for our students. On such occasions, the UAMS AGP reserves the right to retain a portion of the donation for archival purposes in order to provide unique teaching opportunities for our future students. Archiving of such specimens will be inclusively retained by UAMS.\nWhat If I Change My Mind After I Have Agreed To Donate My Body?\nYou can rescind your gift of anatomical donation at any time prior to death by notifying us by phone (501-686-7019) or email (AGP@UAMS.edu), so that we may change our records. No questions will be asked.\nWhat Do I Need To Do To Donate My Body To The Uams Anatomical Gift Program?\nIf you are interested in donating your body, you must be of sound mind and at least 18 years of age (there is no upper age limit) with UAMS Anatomical Gift Program paperwork on file before your passing. These forms require your signature and the signatures of two witnesses. UAMS Anatomical Gift Donors will be provided with a yellow wallet card that signifies they are enrolled in our program.\nUAMS can also accept anatomical donations from both living individuals unable to fill out the donation paperwork and deceased persons who are not signed up at time of death with the AGP. The paperwork would need to be completed by individual ascribed with durable power of attorney for health care. If a durable power of attorney for health care is not in place, donation of behalf of the deceased may be made by next of kin or executor.\nCan My Body Donation (Bequest) Be Made As An Addition To A Will?\nYes, along with completion of all UAMS AGP paperwork.\nWho Should A Donor’s Next Of Kin, Executor, Or Agent Notify Of A Donor’s Death?\nHe/she should contact the donor’s physician. If not reached, contact the county coroner’s office or police department. Once the proper authorities have been notified, please call the UAMS Anatomical Gift Program at 501-686-7019 or the on call number 501-686-7000 and ask for the Anatomical Gift coordinator on call.\nOnce we are notified transportation of the deceased can be arranged. Someone from the UAMS Anatomical Gift Program will be on call 24 hours a day to receive notification. In the event you pass away at a facility that does not have cold storage it is the responsibility of the surviving family to contact a funeral home to do the removal and keep in cold storage until we are able to pick up. Those charges from the funeral home will be the responsibility of the family.\nWho Do I Contact If I Have Further Questions?\nPlease call the UAMS Anatomical Gift Program at 501-686-7019 or send email to AGP@UAMS.edu."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7c861db9-4840-4731-a188-4e0ecdf4fefd>","<urn:uuid:3845d0e3-d973-4fd1-85d6-202f4f426322>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a small business owner, I need to know: what are the common reasons for seeking business financing, and what can make cash flow forecasts inaccurate?","answer":"Common reasons for seeking business financing include lacking working capital to meet everyday needs, looking to expand the business, and establishing a safety buffer against unexpected circumstances. Regarding cash flow forecast inaccuracies, they commonly occur due to changes in receivables or payments when customers don't pay invoices, discrepancies in amounts received, unplanned tax liabilities, and manual processing errors when using tools like Excel for data entry.","context":["Calculating how much finance your business needs\n- What Is Business Finance?\n- When Should You Seek Out Business Financing?\n- How to Calculate How Much Finance Your Business Needs\n- Access Financial Solutions That Work for You\n- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nIf you want to bolster your company's cash flow, invest in its future growth or protect it from unforeseen changes, you might benefit from external financing. However, it can be challenging for businesses looking to secure funding to determine how much is necessary. This guide helps business owners identify their capital needs by offering general insight and outlining two useful simple metrics. We then break down what cash flow solutions are available at MarketFinance, before answering some common questions.\nThere’s no denying it—cash flow is the lifeblood of every business. When it's positive, businesses can cover their expenses and invest in their future growth, but a business's survival can be put at risk when it's negative. If your small business is grappling with cash flow shortages or if you're looking to expand its horizons, it might be a good idea to look into business financing.\nAvailable in both secured and unsecured forms, business financing can offer a lifeline to every type of enterprise. With so many different types available, your business is bound to find the perfect solution to meet its needs. However, even after you’ve settled on an option, you still need to determine how much capital your business requires.\nTo help you work out how much funding to ask for, this guide offers some simple ways to understand the financial needs of your business. From considering your company’s cash flow cycle to formulating financial projections, if you want to establish the amount of financing for your small-to-medium-sized enterprise (SME), read on to find out more.\nIn simple terms, business finance refers to funds that are available to businesses. Also commonly referred to as corporate finance, business finance can help organisations manage their cash flow difficulties and invest in long-term growth. It can also be added to a company's reserves to serve as a crucial buffer if any unexpected events occur.\nBusiness finance can be accessed from various institutions, including traditional banks, building societies and private lenders. Popular types of business finance include business loans, invoice finance, asset finance, merchant cash advances, business overdrafts, business credit cards and commercial mortgages.\nGenerally, there’s no right or wrong reason to seek funding. It all depends on the financial security and future growth plans of your business. However, here are some common reasons why you may be tempted to secure funds from outside your company.\nIf You’re Lacking Working Capital\nWorking capital is the amount of money your business needs to meet its everyday needs. It's used to cover the price of employees, suppliers, and various other vital business assets. If a company doesn't maintain enough working capital, it may struggle to cover the cost of its short-term expenses. Not only does this stagnate the growth of the organisation, but it can also disrupt a business's liquidity ratio. Fortunately, by accessing business finance and fixing cash flow issues, companies can bypass these problems.\nIf You’re Looking to Expand\nAnother reason businesses access external funding is to invest in their future growth. Once you've covered your business's basic expenses, it's only natural to want to take it to the next level. Whether you're looking to invest in your workforce, expand internationally or undergo a digital transformation, business finance can help you achieve this. While the borrowed capital may temporarily put businesses in the red, financing for growth typically produces a promising return on investment (RoI).\nIf You Don’t Have a Safety Buffer\nAnother reason businesses seek out financing is to protect themselves against unexpected circumstances. Businesses have always been vulnerable to sudden changes in the market. However, for many, the events of Covid-19 have re-emphasised the importance of being financially prepared. If your enterprise is making enough to put capital aside each month, it's more likely to be resilient to bumps down the road. If this isn’t currently an option, business funding can help to provide you with a valuable financial buffer.\nUnfortunately, there’s no perfect way to determine your business's capital needs. However, by considering the general attributes of your business, you can form a rough estimate of how much cash you want to keep on hand.\nFirst of all, think about your company's size. If you are running a large enterprise, you could be in a position to allow your working capital to slip into the negative temporarily. Alternatively, if you run a small to medium-sized venture, you’re more likely to be vulnerable to market disruptions. Therefore, in most cases, smaller businesses should keep a little extra in their cash reserves.\nSecondly, consider how your business makes money. If your business relies on physical inventory, you may need more working capital to keep operations running smoothly. This means that whether your business produces or retails goods, it's likely that you will need to acquire more significant financing. On the contrary, because the staff's knowledge is the greatest asset of professional service businesses, these enterprises rarely require as much funding as product-based enterprises.\nThese factors give businesses a general insight into how much financing they need. But if you’re looking for a more detailed estimate, we recommend making a detailed assessment of your company's past and future finances.\nTo do so, follow the following guide:\nWork Out Your Cash Conversion Cycle\nAlso known as an operating cycle, a cash conversion cycle refers to the time it takes for a company to convert their inventories into cash. Since the length of this cycle indicates whether a business has enough cash to meet its obligations, this measurement can help businesses understand when they need capital and how much they may require. However, since this method only accounts for revenue gained from physical stock, it doesn't apply to service businesses.\nYou can work out your cash cycle with this equation:\n- (365 / (cost of goods sold / average inventory)) + (365 / (credit sales / average accounts receivable))\nIf this seems a little technical, don’t worry. Next, we break this equation down step by step.\n1. Determine Your Company's Inventory Period\nWhen calculating a cash cycle, measuring the inventory period should be the first port of call. An inventory period refers to how long a company holds onto its inventory before selling it.\nTo work out your inventory period, you need to determine your inventory turnover by dividing the costs of goods sold by the average inventory. These figures can be found on your company’s balance sheet or income statement. Once you have calculated your inventory turnover, you divide the total days in the inventory period (365) by this figure.\n2. Establish Your Companies Accounts Receivable\nNext, you need to figure out your business accounts receivable. This is simply the money owed to a company by its debtors.\nTo work this out, you need to calculate your business's receivables turnover. You can do this by dividing your credit sales by the average trade receivables you have on hand for a year. After figuring this out, you divide your account receivable period (365) by this number.\nUse These Findings to Calculate Your Cash Cycle Lastly, you can establish your company's cash cycle by adding your inventory period to its accounts variable. This final number reveals the number of days in your business’s operating cycle.\nNow you have your figure; you can compare it against the average cash cycle in your industry to determine how much funding your company needs. This figure varies wildly across industries. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reports that the median cash cycle time is 44 for consumer goods companies, five days for energy companies, 136 for healthcare companies, and 71 for industrial.\nAs a general rule of thumb, if your cash cycle is shorter than these industry averages, it's recommended that you look to secure more funding.\nCalculating your business's cash conversion is one way to assess how much capital it needs moving forward. However, cash flow forecasting is another essential tool businesses can use to make decisions about their finances. What's more, since this metric doesn't rely on the sale of inventory, it can be used by service-based and product-based businesses alike.\nA cash flow forecast helps business owners to estimate the amount of cash coming in and out of their business. Taking note of income and expenses over a certain period provides companies with a projection of their future cash flow, helping them make better-informed decisions about their companies finances.\nIf you like how this sounds, follow these steps to create your cash flow forecast.\n1. Decide on a Time Frame\nBefore you create your future forecast, you need to decide on a timeframe. Cash flow forecasts can cover any time between a month to a year. So, depending on how long you’ve been in business and how detailed you want your estimate to be, carefully consider this timeframe before you start collecting the data.\n2. Workout Your Income\nAfter you've agreed on a time frame, you need to enter your business’s income throughout this period. This includes your sales, tax refunds, grants, and any potential royalties or investments from shareholders you may have received during this time.\nWe recommend keeping a record of your weekly or monthly income before adding it to determine your net income.\n3. Workout Your Expenses\nNext, to factor in your expenses, you will need to calculate your expenses for the same period. This refers to any money your business has spent, including salaries, rent, stock, finance charges like start-up costs, interest rates, and taxes.\nLike you did with your income, you can jot down your weekly or monthly expenses before combining them to figure out your net expenses.\n4. Use These Figures to Calculate Your Forecast\nFinally, to determine your cash flow projection, subtract your net expenses from your net income. This will leave you with a positive or negative cash flow figure.\nIf your cash flow figure is in the red, your business may need to seek more external financing to protect itself against imminent cash flow issues. However, if your forecast looks positive, the amount of funding you need depends more on how much you want to invest in the future growth of your company.\nDon't worry if your business is just getting off the ground or you don't have a detailed record of your finances. You can also gauge how much finance your company needs by reaching out to financial advisors. By talking to the experts, you can get help identifying your cash flow needs and establishing how much capital you may want to invest into your business. While these services often come at a premium, the financial advice they provide is often invaluable.\nAlt text: Two women laughing while standing in a cafe\nNo matter how much funding your business requires, you need to secure the right type of finance to back your venture. However, with each type of financing bringing its own distinct set of advantages and drawbacks, it can be hard to know which arrangement to move forward. At MarketFinance, we understand how hard it can be to get this right. This is why we offer a range of solutions that can be catered to the unique cash flow needs of most businesses.\nIf you deal with more occasional cash flow needs, invoice financing may be a great fit for your business. Invoice finance helps to free up capital tied up in invoices, helping businesses access money owed to them. If you choose MarketFinance, you could receive up to 90% of your unpaid invoices within 24 hours. This can be especially useful to businesses with longer than average cash conversion cycles.

Business finance can help organisations manage their cash flow difficulties, invest in their long-term growth, or protect themselves against unexpected circumstances. Business finance can be accessed from various institutions, including traditional banks and popular types of business finance, including business loans, invoice finance, and business overdrafts.\nWhen should my business seek out funding?\nWhile there's no definitive rule for when a business should seek funding, many factors make external financing a viable option. For instance, if your business lacks working capital, is looking to invest in its future growth, or is interested in establishing a financial safety buffer, it may be wise to look into business funding.\nWhat is a cash conversion cycle?\nAlso referred to as an operating cycle, a cash conversion cycle refers to the time it takes for a company to convert their inventories into cash. The length of this cycle indicates whether a business has enough cash to meet its obligations. Therefore, the metric is used to help business owners decide when they need capital and how much they may require.\nHow do you work out a business's cash conversion cycle?\nIf you want to work out your business's cash conversion cycle, first, you need to determine its inventory period and accounts receivable. Then you add these figures together to find out the total amount of days in your cash conversion cycle.\nWhat is a cash flow forecast?\nA cash flow forecast is a document that helps business owners to estimate their venture's future cash flow. To create the forecast, companies need to track their income and expenses over a certain period. This document can benefit business owners by helping them to make better-informed decisions about their companies finances.\nHow do you make a cash flow forecast?\nIf you're interested in creating a cash conversion forecast, first, you need to decide on an appropriate time frame that you would like to work from. Then, you need to find out your company's total income and expenses during this period. Finally, you subtract your net outcomings from your net income, and you will have a clear overview of your businesses finances.","The cash flow forecast is a critical report for a business of any size or niche. Because it shows how much money you’ll receive and disburse in a given period, the cash forecast serves as a touchstone for decisions about acquisitions, payroll, investing, marketing, and more. If this vital report is inaccurate, the fallout can be potentially dire for your business.\nLeaders of financial teams are increasingly encouraged to take a seat at the table to help make strategic decisions. One of the challenges of the heightened visibility is the expectation of accurate reports. An inaccurate cash flow projection can harm the company and tarnish the reputation of its accounting and AR departments.\nWhen your cash flow forecast is wrong, the first thing to do is understand why it’s flawed.\nCommons Reasons for an Inaccurate Cash Forecast\nOne survey by Deloitte and Kyriba found that 53% of professionals polled admitted their cash forecasts were only “somewhat accurate.” Roughly one-third of respondents believed their cash estimates were accurate with “some variance, but not significant,” while 8% admitted their projections were “very inaccurate.”\nImperfect cash flow forecasting can be due to internal or external factors, including:\n- Changes in receivables or payments. When customers don’t pay their invoices, you have AR on the books that align with your sales budget, but no commensurate cash. When customers don’t pay what’s owed, cash flow is misaligned.\n- Discrepancy in amount received. Another disconnect comes when customers pay their invoices. This might be because of a simple payment error, discrepancy, or a cash shortfall.\n- Unplanned tax liabilities. Unexpected cash outlays can result from errors by your tax professional, unscheduled assessments, penalties, or disallowed deductions or expenses on prior year tax returns.\n- Manual processing errors. Manual tools such as Excel are inherently error-prone. If your team compiles the cash flow forecast manually, flawed data entry, imprecise formulas, and transposition are just a few potential issues.\nHow to Create an Accurate Cash Forecast\nIt’s imperative that your cash flow forecast is as accurate as possible. A study by U.S. Bank found that cash flow problems are to blame for 82% of small business failures, and it’s not only small businesses that feel the pain of inaccurate cash flow. Depending on the extent of the misestimate and contingency options, financial shortfalls can devastate businesses of all sizes,.\nAfter understanding where your cash forecast went wrong, the next step is ensuring you do better next time. More precise cash flow projections begin with best practices. Here are three to consider:\n- Assess your sales pipeline. Examine upcoming deals to determine if they will culminate and when sales should begin. Consider issues that could affect anticipated revenue from existing customers.\n- Understand expenses. Cash outlays flow to fixed and variable expenses, and debt obligations. Ensure your forecast uses the most up-to-date budget information and input from department heads.\n- Automate AR collections. Use an automated AR tool to stay on top of late-paying customers, more accurately predict payment of outstanding AR, and avoid a cash crunch from overdue AR.\nSales team visibility in the collections process can improve AR payments, lower DSO and improve the customer experience. That adds up to more reliable cash flow forecasting. Using an automated AR solution frees up your accounting and finance teams to focus on customer service activities, reporting, and key performance metrics without the strain of manual AR management."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b6585e12-4a1e-4178-8688-aed355528656>","<urn:uuid:f5e0dff1-df38-43e0-aa4e-2fd62dd7792d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How long after roasting should coffee beans be used for espresso?","answer":"Espresso blends are best when used within two weeks of roasting. However, the carbon dioxide in the beans during the first day or two after roasting can interfere with espresso extraction, so many cafés allow the coffee to rest 48 hours prior to use.","context":["Have a question or just want to talk espresso? Check out the forum and its FAQs and Favorites!\nFirst, if you can't tell the difference between a Panamanian and Papua New Guinean coffee, put off the espresso and get to know good coffee first. Buy a freshly roasted half pound each from Central America, Africa, South America, and Indonesia, and learn to appreciate their differences. Those who buy the green coffees for espresso, those who roast and blend them, and those who pull the best shots have one thing in common: they know their coffee well. In any case, espresso is coffee intensified; if there are coffees you dislike brewed, you really want to avoid them in espresso.\nSecond, go into a coffee store and look for \"espresso roast.\" What you'll almost always find is dark brown to black beans shining in oil. Starbucks' success has reinforced the impression that espresso is any coffee roasted very dark. This is wrong on almost all counts. Coffee blends destined for espresso come in a variety of roasts, ranging from a milk chocolate colored dry bean, to a dark chocolate colored slightly oil-sheened bean, to a black and very oily bean. The very lightest roasts for regular brewing (cinnamon or tan colored) cannot be used for espresso, but otherwise any roast level will work.\nInstead, espresso is almost always a blend of beans; the Italian word for blend is miscela. There is fairly wide latitude in blending, but there are also some general rules. The most basic rule of espresso blending is that espresso must have subdued acidity, be heavy bodied, and be sweet enough to balance the bitter and acidic flavors in the blend.\nA large proportion of the blend will consist of \"natural\" or \"pulped-natural\" processed beans from Brasil, Indonesia, Ethiopia, or Yemen. Natural or \"dry processed\" means the coffee cherry is air dried on the tree or on terraces prior to removing the skin and fruit from the pit (the actual coffee bean). Pulped-natural or \"semi-wet processed\" means the skin is removed, but the fruit remains on the bean while it is drying. These techniques create the more heavy bodied, sweet, and subdued acidity coffees required by espresso brewing. Such coffees also develop more crema. Single origin, unblended espresso is almost always derived from a bean of this type. The drawback of these techniques, even when carefully done, is they create a few fermented beans with off-flavors that slightly muddy the aroma and taste.\nThe alternative, known as wet processing, washes the skin and fruit off the bean prior to drying. This process produces less sweet, more acidic coffees, which generally would be unsuitable for espresso if used pure. However, since these beans often have beautifully clean and powerful floral and fruity aromas and tastes, they are used in smaller proportions in more expensive blends to enhance the more subdued taste of dry processed beans. When these beans are used, the coffee is usually roasted at the lighter end of the espresso spectrum, since dark roasting destroys their aromatics.\nFinally, some espresso blends use Robusta coffees, which derive from a different species of coffee tree found at lower altitudes and having higher yields. These coffees are generally less expensive than the Arabicas discussed above. Low grade Robustas can add body, sweetness, and above all, very strong crema to an espresso. But they do so at the expense of having an unpleasant, burnt rubber smell. High grade Robustas do not have this offensive odor, but will usually muffle the other aromatics. Their use is controversial. Many very gifted espresso professionals use Robustas, while many others would never touch them.\nDifferent roasters have different blending strategies. Some use only two to four different coffees; these blends can have very distinct tastes and will vary a lot year to year. Other roasters will try to keep the blend's taste the same year in, year out. They will do this by using seven to twelve different coffees, many from different plantations in the same country and region, so as to average out the annual variations of coffees from any one plantation.\nAs with all coffee, espresso blends are always best when used within two weeks of roasting. Unlike regular brewing, the carbon dioxide in the beans in the first day or two after roasting can sometimes interfere with the espresso extraction, so many cafés allow the coffee to rest 48 hours prior to use.\nMy main advice is to first find several good local roasters. Try many different espresso blends, varying in roast levels, use of Robusta (or not), level of acidity, or use of wet processed coffees, and then decide for yourself which styles you like most. Ask the roasters about what's in the blend; the exact recipes are usually proprietary, but they will be happy to give you general information so you can develop an informed preference. If you home roast, try various dry or semi-wet processed Brasils, Indonesians, Ethiopian and Yemen coffees, and create a blending base from your favorites among these. Then add small amounts of your favorite wet processed, high grown Arabica to give it some distinctiveness. If this later coffee is exceptionally sweet and low acid, more than the usual 10% to 20% can be used.\nAs mentioned earlier, most washed, high grown coffees are unsuitable for espresso either straight or in high proportions in a blend. In my opinion, this shows that espresso technology requires further development. It would be absurd if you tried to buy a coffee and were told it was too strong to be prepared in a presspot.\nHowever, espresso technology has advanced far enough so that some high-grown, washed coffees can make interesting and sometimes spectacular shots. These usually don't have the balance of conventional blends, but can have far more interesting aromas and tastes. Low toned, sweet coffees, even those from regions usually not regarded as suitable for espresso, are always worth trying as single origin shots. The research that could adapt espresso equipment to the full range of coffees won't happen until more people try these, develop an appreciation for them, and form a market for roasters, cafés, and manufacturers pushing the envelope.\nFinally, a note about water, the other constituent of good coffee and espresso. Water for coffee should be pure and odor free. Charcoal filtering to remove chlorine and sediments from municipal water is a good idea. Further filtering is required if the water is from a well having iron, sulfur, heavy metals, or organic contaminants. Alternatively, consider bottled water.\nNote that \"pure water\" in this case does not mean distilled or free of all minerals. Natural water contains calcium carbonate and some magnesium carbonate; these constitute the water's hardness. Overly soft (low mineral) water will create a light bodied, metallic and excessively bright tasting shot. Overly hard (high mineral) water will scale the machine, while the chalkiness of the calcium carbonates precipitating as the water heats will interfere with proper extraction. The best coffee water has about 5 grains (90 mg/L) hardness and 150 mg/L total mineral content. For espresso machines, water at about 3 grains (50 mg/L) and 90 mg/L total mineral content is used to reduce descaling costs. This is a compromise on the ideal water for espresso, but the 90 mg/L shots are almost indistinguishable from shots with the higher 150 mg/L mineral content. If your tap water is excessively hard or soft, look into bottled water or water treatment options, many of which are not expensive.\nNext page: Espresso grinders..."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:89e7fd9f-ca5f-479a-9395-6da7f1234855>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does proper skylight flashing installation work, and what are the cost implications of roof flashing repairs overall?","answer":"Skylight flashing installation requires applying self-sticking waterproof underlayment in 6-inch strips from bottom to top, with each piece lapping over the lower one. The metal flashing pieces don't need sealing to each other but must be installed in the correct order since water runs downhill. For costs, while skylight flashing ranges from $50-100, general roof flashing repairs average around $350, with maximum costs for skylights, vents, and chimneys reaching about $500. New flashing installation can cost between $400-1000, including new shingles and resealing where needed.","context":["Leakproof skylight flashing\nApply self-sticking underlayment\nInstall 6-in.-wide strips of a self-sticking waterproof underlayment. This underlayment will direct any water that may get through the metal flashing onto the roofing felt. Install from the bottom up, lapping each piece on top of the lower one.\nIf you have to replace shingles around a skylight, examine the old flashing. Most residential skylights sit on a raised curb made watertight with metal flashing. If it’s carefully removed when the old roof is torn off, it should be reusable. If not, you’ll have to buy new flashing ($50 to $100) either from the skylight manufacturer or from a roofing company that has a metal fabrication shop (look under “Roofing” in the Yellow Pages or online).\nFirst remove the skylight’s counterflashing. On some units, you have to remove the whole glass frame (lead photo below). On other models, you simply unscrew a metal channel from the curb. Next pry off the old shingles, carefully pulling nails to save the flashing. To reassemble, follow the steps as outlined by the photos, and you’ll have a leakproof installation. Note that the metal flashing pieces don’t need to be sealed to each other. Since water runs downhill, they only need to be installed in the right order. So put away that roofing cement.\nIf you’re hiring a roofing crew, ask them to carefully remove the old flashing and reuse it if it’s in good shape.\nCorrectly Flashed Skylight\nThis skylight shows the correct flashing technique to make it waterproof. Numbers 1 - 4 correspond to the 4 photos above. Number 5 shows how the final step, counterflashing, is integral to the skylight and covers the upper edges of the roof flashing.\nEasy Shingle Repair\nFix those potential leaks now.\nTools & Materials\nRemove those ugly damaged shingles and stop potential roof leaks by following this simple three-step shingle replacement process.\nReplace damaged shingles\nPry gently to break shingle free\nGently tap a flat bar under the shingles to break the seal-down strips free. Don't force it—shingles rip easily.\nA broken shingle is both ugly and a leak waiting to happen. But as long as you can find matching shingles (and you're not afraid of heights), the repair is straightforward.\nPick a day when the weather is moderate to do the repair—too cold and the shingles can crack; too warm and the shingle sealants are tough to break.\nLoosen the tabs under the broken shingle and the next two courses above it. Shingles are fastened with eight nails each—four at the center just above the tab slots and four through the shingle above it—and you have to lift up all the shingles that cover those nails to remove them.\nAfter all the tabs are loose, push the flat bar up under the damaged shingle to each nail, centering the nail in the flat bar notch To avoid ripping shingles, gently work the pry bar under both tabs as you push it up.\nPop out the nails by prying underneath the shingle instead of trying to dig the nail head out from the top of the shingle; that will wreck the shingle. Then push the shingle down from the nail head and pull out the nail. After removing the center row of nails on the damaged shingle, lift the undamaged shingles above it and remove the next row of nails. Then pull out the damaged shingle.\nSlide the new shingle up into place. Nail the center row first, then the center row of the course above it, nailing 1/2 in. over from the old holes (Photo 3). Nail at the top of the slots between the tabs, just above the sealant strip.Roof Flashing: Replace Plumbing Vent Flashing\nTools & Materials\nThe metal or rubber flashing around plumbing vents can deteriorate or rust through over time, creating water leaks. Here's how to replace the flashing and stop the leaks.\nPry up shingles\nRemove one or two shingles above the vent flashing, then pry out the vent, being careful not to damage the shingles.\nPlumbing vent flashings are notorious spots for roof leaks. If you have a leak in the general area of a plumbing vent, check the condition of the vent flashing. Look for rust holes or gaps around metal vents (required for cast iron waste lines). If you have rubber vents (which are used for plastic pipe), check to see if they have become brittle and cracked.\nBoth types extend under at least two courses of shingles, so you'll usually need to remove a few shingles above the flashing to get the old one out without ripping any shingles. If you don't have any shingles left from the last roofing, be extra careful not to rip any. (Even if you can find new shingles in the same style, the color won't match perfectly.)\nLoosen the tabs on the shingles above the vent first. Those shingles won't be removed, but you'll need to get under those tabs to get at the nails on the shingles directly below. Work from the top down, removing any shingles covering the vent flashing. Getting the tabs free without ripping them is the only tricky part. Work a putty knife slowly under the bottom lip of each tab and slip it through the adhesive to break the seal from one side to the other. Don't try to pry up the whole tab at once or it will rip. Once the tabs are free, slip the flat bar under the shingle and tap it up under the nail head. Pop the shingle and nail up, then pull the flat bar out from under the shingle and pop the nail head up from above the shingle. Don't worry if you accidentally tear the nail head through the shingle. When you replace the shingle, just put the nail in slightly above the hole and fill the old hole with caulk.\nSlip a flat bar under the edge of the vent flashing and pop the nails up . Pull the old flashing up over the vent pipe and scrape any old caulk and debris off the roof. Slide the new flashing over the vent pipe and under the shingles above the pipe. Center the pipe in the flashing and push the flexible front corners up or down so that the flashing pipe is parallel to the vent pipe. (Rubber vent flashing automatically adjusts to any pitch.) Lift the vent enough to spread caulk under the sides (but not the bottom edge), then nail with three 1-1/4-in. roofing nails per side. Put one nail in the bottom edge with a dab of caulk under it to seal the hole.\nSet the top part of the vent on the pipe. Make sure the inside of the lead collar fits inside the pipe, then tighten the pipe clamp. Finally, replace the shingles\nRemoving Damaged Shingles\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 1\nUse the proper safety precautions. Any time you're getting up on the roof you need to practice roof safety. Wear protective eyewear, heavy-duty gloves, and gripping boots appropriate for walking on the roof. Preferably, you'll also install roof jacks to have something to stand on, and harnesses to protect yourself. Never do roof work alone.\nHow you access the roof will depend upon the roof itself and the location of the damage. Always use a secure, sturdy ladder when you're climbing up on the roof, and have a helper to secure it at the base. When walking on the roof, always walk slowly and secure your footing before taking another step.\nIf you're just trying to assess the damage and replace a few damaged shingles, it might seem like overkill to install roof jacks and harnesses, but depending on the complexity and the height of your roof, it might be the safest option. Roof work isn't something to rush.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 2\nAssess the damage. Find the damaged area of shingles and determine how many new shingles you'll need and the extent of the damage underneath. Look at the corners on the shingles surrounding the damage. Are they curled and pulled up from the roof?\nCheck the damaged area for damage to the moisture barrier or flashing, and check the damaged area for signs of seepage. If the surrounding shingles aren't doing the work of keeping moisture out, you'll need to replace everything in the square around the damaged area.\nIn some cases, it might be better to remove all the shingles from a roof in urgent need of repairs and re-roof the house instead. If the shingles in the area surrounding the damage are old, brittle, and dry, it’s probably not worth taking the care to re-secure them to the roof.\nCracked or split shingles may be repaired without removing them, provided they're still in good condition. You can learn more about securing the shingles in the following section.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 3\nRemove shingles in cool weather. Asphalt and asphalt sealant will heat up in hot weather, making it moldable and much more difficult to remove. It's a lot easier to remove shingles that are cooled down and slightly more brittle than the moldable, so do the work of removing them first thing in the morning, before the sun has beaten down upon them considerably.\nWet shingles to cool them down before removal, if you must work in the heat. Wetting them down with a small amount of water will help them to tighten and firm up, making them much easier to remove, if necessary.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 4\nLoosen the adhesive under the tabs two rows above the damage. Removing all the shingles on the roof is usually done with a large hayfork , or rake-sized scraper used for removing shingles. Since you're only removing a portion of shingles, though, it's usually better to use a smaller tool. A pry bar, crow-bar, or the claw of a hammer works perfectly at getting under and carefully prying up shingles, separating the adhesive and revealing the nails of the shingles underneath.\nA good rule of thumb is to remove at least five tabs in the second row above the damaged \"3-tab\" shingle. Pull up enough shingles to reveal the nails of all the damaged shingles that need removed below.\nThe end seams should be lined-up about a foot off to one side of the damaged one. In other words, you'll want to make sure that you pull off shingles in a radius around the damaged portion, to make sure you get everything.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 5\nLoosen the exposed nails. Slide your flat pry-bar under the shingles around the damaged portion. Work around the nail, pulling it up. Carefully lift each surrounding tab about 45 to 60 degrees. Go very slowly, but pry firmly, and try not to crack or break them. If the surrounding shingles are in good shape, you can reattach them when you're finished replacing the damaged shingles, saving you money and effort.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 6\nContinue loosening the adhesive and nails closer to the damaged shingles. Work your way progressively closer to the damage. Lift the tabs in the first row above the damaged shingle and withdraw the loosened nails from that shingle with the pry-bar by using the same process.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 7\nLoosen and remove the damaged shingles. Loosen the adhesive underneath the tabs of the damaged shingle, then pull them free and discard. If the shingles are severely damaged, don't try to salvage them. Just remove them and replace them with new shingles of a similar style to the rest of the shingles on the roof.\nContinue removing the damaged shingles until you've cleared out the shingles that will need replaced. It'll be easier to remove everything before you get started replacing them.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 8\nGet the necessary replacement materials. To replace shingles, you'll obviously need shingles to replace the ones you remove and the materials necessary to secure. Most shingles that are in need of replacement are three-tab asphalt shingles. If your roof involves some other variety of shingle, you'll need to match your new shingles to the old. To complete the job properly, you'll need:\nReplacement shingles. Buy more than you'll need at the home repair store. You should be able to count up how many damaged shingles will need replacement and buy accordingly. It's good to have replacements on hand.\nShingle cement or adhesive. Some shingles come with adhesive strips pre-installed, making this unnecessary. If you buy unbacked shingles, though, you might need to purchase additional adhesive to secure them to the roof before nailing them. It's a good idea to buy it to secure other loose shingles anyway.\nRoofing nails. Most three-tab shingles will be pre-cut with guide holes that will make the installation process very simple. To secure them, you'll need roofing nails, which are heavy-duty, and about two or three inches long.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 9\nInstall the new shingle. Place a new shingle in the same position as the shingle you removed. If the shingles are backed with adhesive strip, remove the covering and push them into place, then nail them to secure them. Most shingles have pre-cut holes for nails, usually three per shingle. Follow the directions of the shingles that you purchase, or use the other shingles on the roof as a guide.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 10\nReseal under edges of all three shingles. Lift each tab slightly on the shingles as you install them, and apply a 1\" (2.5 cm) diameter spot of shingle cement under each tab. Press tabs down into the cement firmly and secure the shingle into place. Continue installing shingles and securing them with adhesive accordingly, until you've installed all the damaged shingles along the row.\nAfter you've finished the damage portion, you can start working your way back up the roof, retailing the loose shingles into place, as long as they're in good shape, and using the adhesive to secure them back onto the roof.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 11\nSecure other loose shingles while you’re at it. While you're up there working, it's a good idea to keep an eye out for other areas that look like they may become problematic in the future. Keep an eye out for curled or weathered-looking shingles that might allow water to seep in underneath. Using your adhesive, lift the tabs gently and re-secure them.\nShingles become damaged when water gets in underneath and starts rotting from beneath. If you rescuer loose or weathered shingles on a regular basis, you'll get a considerable amount more life out of them. Regular touch-ups can extend the life of a roof immensely.\nImage titled Replace Damaged Roof Shingles Step 12\nFix cracked or split shingles instead of replacing them. If shingles become cracked or otherwise split, because of falling branches or other types of damage, consider using adhesive to repair them as best you can, instead of removing them completely. Line the crack with a liberal amount of adhesive and stick it back together to repair it. Hold it in place for several seconds and let it seal","What is roof flashing?\nRoof flashing is a simple product that is savoir for your roofs; it is usually a flat and thin metal that you can use to protect your roof from water damage. Flashing for roof installation on the opening and cracks that are present on your roof. For example, near the vents, chimneys, skylights, etc. Roof flashings are mostly placed under the shingles. It works by guiding the water on your roof to your desired location on the roof.\nIn this article, you will learn everything about roof flashing, including flashing roof price, types, installation, repair and flashing benefits. So, without wasting further time, let’s get started.\nFlashing roof types\nThere are many types of flashings. You can differentiate its different types from its location on the roof or shape.\nCounter flashing roof\nSuppose your roof consists of chimneys and any other area where the wall meets the roof. Then on that type of roof, counter flashing is mandatory to keep your home dry. There are many types of materials used for counter flashing, like Aluminum, copper, galvanized steel, etc. Counter flashing consists of two parts.\n- The first part of the counter flashing is placed in the chimney’s brickwork.\n- In addition to the first part of the chimney, there is a second part called the base.\nCounter flashing keeps your home dry and prevents water from entering your home from the base of chimneys. It redirects water from the base of chimneys to the gutter or down the roof.\nMetal flashing roof\nMetal flashing on the roof is the most durable and flexible way to prevent your roof from leaking. In multiple flashings, “metal flashing roofs” are the most common type used for flashing purposes.\nMetal roofing flashing types\nFlashing metal roof is made from different materials. Each material that is used for flashing defines the metal flashing type. Metal roof flashing can be classified into the following types:\n- Lead with copper coating\n- Malleable metal\n- Stainless steel\nWhat is step flashing on a roof?\nIf you have a side wall or a chimney on your roof, then step then you must use step flashing. Step flashing is a flat metal installed between shingles and chimneys.\nStep flashing protect your roof against water by guiding water down to the gutter. The step price can be varied from $0.33 to $96. However, an average price of a step flashing is around $13. So, take a good market survey and find suitable step flashing.\nWall flashing is another important type of roof flashing. It is also a flat metal which has a bent of 135 degrees. This type of flashing is used on the top of windows, points of structural support, or door openings. You can easily protect your home from water that dips from the edges of door openings or windows. Wall flashing roof comes in two types of designs:\n- Wall flashing without or with safety hem\n- Wall flashing with drip edge\nA piece of wall flashing varies from $20 to $105.\nValley flashing roof is another important type of roof flashing which is used in the following places:\n- Middle sections of a roof.\n- On the places where two roof sections intersect.\nThere are multiple types of roof valley flashing available in the marker. Some types are as follows:\n- V-Valley Hem\n- V-Valley hem and ribbed\n- W- Valley\n- W- Valley hem\n- W- Valley hem and ribbed\nFlashing roof vents are also known as pipe flashing or vent boot. This flashing prevents your roof from water damage around the vents or pipes. Flashing roof vents has been installed in the following places:\n- Plumbing vents.\n- Pipe vents that are made for stoves\nFlashing vents are made from metal or rubber compression fitting. This flashing made a water-tight seal to prevent the roof from water damage.\nB vent roof flashing is a common type of vent roof flashing. This is made with corrosion-proof metals.\nFlashing roof edge boundaries is often called Drip Edges Roof Flashing. Drop edges are available as thin sheets bent in the shape of an L. The location of installation of these boundaries is the edges of the roofs. In the market, drip edge flashing is also known as D-metal.\nThe main function of these flashing is to direct fascia water into the drain or gutter of the building. The price of one piece of drip edge roof flashing starts from $8 to $16 per piece. However, the installation cost of this flashing type is $1 to $3 per foot for simple flashing.\nKick out flashing\nKick-out flashing is used with the cladding of a building and puts away the roof’s water from the cladding. It protects the roof from seepage water on cladding areas. Water can’t enter the roof from the building envelope after installing a kick-out flashing roof.\nKick-out flashing costs you around $10 to $15 per piece. However, the repair cost of kick-out flashing for the whole roof is around $300 to $600.\nThe LED flashing is used to secure water seepage from the joints of the roof. Most of the time, this flashing is good for chimneys, walls, vents, and windows. For some reason, if you can’t find LED flashing, then modified bitumen is the best alternative to LED flashing roofs.\nFlashing for flat roof\nIf you have a building with a flat roof, then the EPDM flashing type is the best choice. It is used to protect your roof from water penetration around roof corners. EPDM flashing rubber seals the entire flash roof and save it from water damage.\nBase flashing roof is also another important flashing type. The purpose of base flashing is to protect water penetration along a wall or parapet. It also has a 90-degree angle in it. This right angle can stop water penetration at a point where the roof meets with a vertical surface.\nFlashing roof price\nAfter knowing about different types of flashing roofs now, the next thing you must know about flashing roofs is the price. The price of a flashing roof depends on the type of roof and the type of flashings you want to use. However, the average flashing repair cost is approximately $350. The maximum roof flashing cost for skylights, vents, and chimneys is around $500. The minimum cost that you can expect is $200. For calculating different roof sizes, you can multiply the square foot area by $15 to $25. The answer to this multiplication gives you the expected cost of flashing roof repair.\nNew flashing installation can cost you from $400 to $1000. At this cost, you can get new shingles for your roof, and where resealing is required can also be accommodated in this price.\nHow to repair a Flashing roof?\nRoof flashing is a great way to secure your roof from leaking. However, sometime you may face leakage in the roof despite flashings. That is why knowing basic things about repairing flashing is very important. Detailed information about flashing repair is provided in this section.\nFor the repairing purpose of flashing the roof, first of all, you must rough the area around the hole of flashing. You can use the following things to roughen the area:\n- Wire Brush\nAfter properly roughing the area around the hole, clean it with cloth or air.\nIn the second step, you must cut a flashing roofing patch of the same material used earlier. The patch must be larger than the hole.\nNow it’s time to put roofing cement on the roughened area.\nNow put the flashing patch on the roughing cement so that it is affixed firmly and covers all the holes.\nIn the last step, you must cover the flashing patch with roofing cement for extra safety.\nBenefits of flashing roof\n- The following are the main benefits of flashing roofs:\n- Roof flashing gives you ultimate protection from water damage.\n- If you install a flashing roof, you can save a lot of money that must be spent on maintaining the roof.\n- Flashing the roof is also helpful in increasing the life of your roof.\nProper roof flashing is essential for preventing water damage to your roof and home. The act of flashing serves as a protective barrier, preventing water from infiltrating the roof deck and leading to expensive damages. It costs an average of over $3,000 to repair water damage, and some repairs can cost as much as $14,000. By hiring a professional contractor to install flashing correctly, you can protect your home and save money in the long run.\nFlashing Roof- Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWater damage can be prevented by using flashing on the roof. It is made with thin metal like copper, steel, etc. The installation of flashing must have to be done by professional roofers. Flashing work in the areas where the roof met with the wall or other roofs. Rainwater is diverted to the gutter from the roof by this device.\nFlashing to the roof is a thing of metal. Its purpose is to give water a certain direction from seams and joints. Moreover, it prevents water from penetrating through the roof’s cracks or openings.\nFlashing and gutters are two different things. Flashing is a metal that creates a buffer between the roof line and the gutter. Flashing also creates a path for water that ends in your house’s gutter.\nThe following materials can be used for flashing:\n– Stainless steel"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0c4da26d-8529-4fb3-a60f-2c79a124530b>","<urn:uuid:93baaae4-2be4-446b-86f7-c0b31b9cf204>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the Indian Constitution establish sovereignty and secularism, and what legal protections exist against religious discrimination?","answer":"India's Constitution establishes sovereignty by giving the state supreme authority to rule independently both within and outside its boundaries, without foreign interference unless permitted. The secular nature is upheld through constitutional provisions and legal precedents. In the S.R Bommai case, secularism was declared part of the constitution's basic structure. The Indira Nehru Gandhi case established that state cannot discriminate based on religion. The IPC further protects religious harmony by criminalizing acts like damaging places of worship, insulting religious beliefs, and disturbing religious ceremonies. These offenses are punishable with imprisonment and fines, demonstrating the legal framework's commitment to protecting religious freedom while maintaining secular principles.","context":["Article authored by Komal Bhati First year student from Army Institute of Law\n“Constitution is not an instrument for the government to restrain the people, it is an instrument for the people to restrain the government.” – Patrick Henry\nA document which is supreme and legally binds the citizens of a country is called constitution. Constitution of India is one of the “lengthiest constitutions in the world”. It is considered as the “supreme law” which binds the entire nation. It has taken inspiration from written documents of various countries like fundamental rights from USA, Parliamentary form of government from UK, etc. The base or the original structure is based on the “Government of India act, 1935”. The provisions of amendment and the unchanging nature of the basic structure makes our constitution flexible and rigid respectively.\nOriginally, it has eight parts, twenty-two schedules and three hundred ninety-five articles. It has provision for all sections of our country which include schedule caste, schedule tribe, women, children, disable and all the other weaker section of our country. Our constitution ensures that the citizens of our country can live, express, practice, work, learn and do many others things freely which do not harm the other citizens and also do not disturb the integrity of our nation.

It says that this constitution is made to protect people from injustice and give them freedom to grow and develop to grow in best environment.\n“India is a Sovereign country” which means that India is independent and all powerful to rule its own land, no other country can interference into the matters of our country until it permits to do so. Sovereignty is important as it gives power to the state to rule its people independently. This status makes fixed territory, population and established government as important elements of the state to do justice with the term sovereignty or to get all the tools to function as a sovereign state. It gives state the supreme authority within as well as outside the boundaries of the state.\nFor example, Prime Minister performing taking all the decision of the government with the advice of the council of ministers is the example for within the state and the decision of India to step out of the RCEP group is the sovereign decision outside the boundaries of the state.\n‘Secular state’ means in the matters of the religion it will neither support nor negate any religion but respect the sentiments of all the religion.\nIndia is a country where people of different religion stay together, to maintain the peace among them, the secular nature of the state is very important. It promotes the unity among the different religious communities and also give right to every community to practice and promote their religious practice without raising any seeds of communal violence.\nIn the case of S.R Bommai v. Union of India, it was held that secularism is the part of the basic structure of the constitution and also state cannot interfere in the matters of the religion.\nIn the case of the Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Shri Raj Narain and another, it was held that state cannot discriminate any citizens on the grounds of religion.\nConstitution has established democratic form of government that gets its authority or the ruling powers from the people’s will. It gives ‘Supreme power to the people’ through the right of universal adult franchise which gives voting rights to the citizens above the age of eighteen years.\nPrime minister gets its place as the head of government after he had got the majority of the votes in the election, this is how democracy works.\nDemocratic and Republic are almost same. It also says that the government must be elected by the people’s will but this adds on more significance and meaning to the democratic form of government which says that elected government will work according to the rule of the law i.e., Constitution. Like if there is only democratic form of government then the leader which is elected by the majority’s will can work according to his own will but if the government is both democratic and republic it has to abide by the rule of law.\nParliamentary v. Presidential system\nIn Parliamentary form of government, Prime minister is the head of the government and the real power of the executive lies in the hands of Prime minister. He works on the support and advice of the council of ministers (given in the article 74 and 75 of the constitution).\nThe PM and council of ministers are responsible for both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha of the Parliament which makes them responsible for the legislature. And the President is just the nominal head of the executive. This form of government is not very stable because the government can be dissolved by the no confidence motion. There is no separation of powers as the members of the executive are among the members of the legislature.\nIn Presidential form of government, President is both the head of the state and also the head of the government. He selects his own cabinets who are highly skilled and specialized in their respective fields. He is not bound with the advice of the cabinet minister which makes him as very powerful head of the government. President is not the part of legislature and is not even responsible towards it for his policies and acts. This is a more stable form of government because it cannot be dissolved with the no confidence motion. The impeachment of the president is only way to get the president down from its position which is also very lengthy process.\nThe judicial review is the part of the basic structure of the constitution. The judiciary is called as the “Guardian of the Constitution” which makes it responsible for the action of the legislature and executive which violates the provisions of the constitution. Judicial review is a power which authorizes the court to invalidate any act that is violative of the basic structure of the constitution.\nIn the case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, it was held by the court that parliament is having the power to amend the constitution but cannot break the basic structure of the constitutional including the feature of judicial review.\nIn the case of A.K. Gopalan v. the state of Madras, it was held that the preventive detention is subject to the provision of the judicial review.\nConstitution of India has lots of salient features which makes it unique and suitable for diverse country like India. All the provisions, articles and rights of the constitution gives free environment to the citizens in which they can enjoy their liberty.\n AIR 1994 SC 1918.\n AIR 1975 SC 2299.\n AIR 1973 SC 1461.\n AIR 1950 SC 27.","By Akhil Mahesh, National University of Advanced Legal Studies, Kochi\n“Editor’s Note: The Constitution of India grants freedom of religion and the Indian Penal Code lays down provisions for offences relating to religion. These offences can be classified into three broad categories: defilement of places of worship or objects of veneration, outraging or wounding the religious feelings of persons, disturbing religious assemblies. This paper discusses the various offences defined under these categories.”\n‘It is the cardinal principle of good government that every man should be suffered to profess his own religion and that no man should be suffered to insult the religion of another.’\n–Kutti Chanami Moothan v. RanaPattar, (1978) 19 Cri LJ 960\nThis is exactly the principle upon which Chapter XV of the Indian Penal Code is framed. It makes any deliberate acts perpetrated by persons of one religious persuasion for the insult or annoyance of persons of another persuasion punishable.[i] This adheres to the principle of secularism which falls in line with the Preamble of the Constitution of India along with Articles 25 to 30. Article 25 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion. All persons are thereby entitled to practice, profess and propagate a religion of their choice. This freedom, though quite vast, is not an unlimited one. It is one that is subject to public order, morality and health.\nSimultaneously, the State has to ensure that the religious beliefs of individuals do not become causes of hostility, tensions, controversies or violence of any manner amongst the people. Chapter XV of the Indian Penal Code ostensibly helps the State in maintenance and continuation of religious harmony in the country.\nThis chapter contains five sections – ss 295, 295a, 296, 297 and 298. The offences under this chapter can be broadly classified under three divisions:\n- Defilement of places of worship or objects of veneration (ss 295 and 297)\n- Outraging or wounding the religious feelings of persons (ss 295A and 296)\n- Disturbing religious assemblies (s 296)\nDEFILEMENT OF PLACES OF WORSHIP OR OBJECTS OF VENERATION\nWhoever destroys, damages or defiles any place of worship, or any object held sacred by any class of persons with the intention of thereby insulting the religion of any class of persons or with the knowledge that any class of persons is likely to consider such destruction, damage or defilement as an insult to their religion, shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.\nWhoever, with the intention of wounding the feelings of any person, or of insulting the religion of any person, or with the knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded, or that the religion of any person is likely to be insulted thereby,commits any trespass in any place of worship or on any place of sculpture, or any place set apart from the performance of funeral rites or as a depository for the remains of the dead, or offers any indignity to any human corpse, or causes disturbance to any persons assembled for the performance of funeral ceremonies,shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.\nSection 295 compels people to respect the religious susceptibilities of persons of different religious persuasions or creeds by making destruction, damage or defilement of a place of worship or an object held sacred, with the intent to insult the religion, by a class of persons, punishable.[ii] Section 297 extends the principle in Section 295 to places which are treated as sacred. It punishes a person who, with the intent to insult the religion of another or hurt the religiou feelings of a person, commits trespass in any place of worship or of sepulture, or any place of burial or place set apart for burial rites.[iii]\nThe essential ingredients of this section are:\n- Intention or knowledge.\n- Destruction, damage or defilement of:\n- A place of worship\n- A place of veneration\n- An object held sacred\n- Trespass into:\n- A place of worship\n- A place of sepulture\n- A place set for performing funeral rites or a depository of remains of the dead\nIntention or Knowledge\nThe essence of the offence under Section 295 is the intention to destroy, damage or defile a place of worship or an object held sacred. Without the requisite mens rea, mere defilement of a place of worship is not an offence. The intention to insult is a question of fact which can be judged depending on the facts and circumstances of the case.\nIn the case of Jan Mohammed v. Narain Das[iv]the accused removed some rubble and old building materials belonging to a mosque that was in rotten condition and consequently in disuse. The accused was held not liable under these sections as he had no intention of insulting the Mohammedan religion or any of its practitioners. He also had no knowledge that his actions may cause insult or hurt to any class of people.\nBut, throwing a lit cigarette by a Mohammedan on the ‘Viman’, an object sacred to the Hindus cannot be said to be an unintentional act or one without guilty knowledge. Such an action is an insult to the Hindu religion and its practitioners. Hence the accused was held guilty.[v] Also, committing sexual intercourse within or inside a mosque or a temple is an offence under Section 297.[vi]\nDestruction, Damage or Defilement\nThe words destroy or damage usually mean an act physically or materially affecting the property concerned but it should also be understood in the sense of making property dirty, unclean or foul. The word ‘defilement’ would not only mean physical destruction but also situations wherein the place of worship or the object of worship would be rendered ritually or ceremonially impure. The presence of a person belonging to a lower caste in a Hindu temple open to only those of higher castes was held not to be defilement under the ambit of Section 295.[vii]\nPlace or Object to be Sacred\nAn essential ingredient of this section is that the destruction caused should be of a place of worship or an otherwise sacred place. Whether or not a particular place or object is sacred is a question of fact and as a general rule, temples, churches, mosques, synagogues, kyaungs are all considered sacred by virtue of them being places of worship. In Joseph v. State of Kerala[viii] the accused got bona fide possession of a hut on agricultural land by a court order. This hut was used as a place of worship by people. The accused took possession and razed the hutment and took down the pictures of the Hindu Gods. He was charged under Section 295. The High Court held that he had the right to use the land as he pleased and had not intended to hurt the religious sentiments of others and hence acquitted him.\nBooks like the Bible, the Koran and the Granth Sahib are all held to be sacred even though they are not worshipped per se.\nTrespass into Place of Worship or Place of Sepulture\nSection 297 makes any trespass into a place of worship or a place of sepulture a criminal offence. This means that the trespass committed need not amount to criminal trespass for it to come within the scope of Section 297.[ix] The word ‘trespass’ has been used in this section to indicate an unjustifiable intrusion upon a property in the possession of another.[x] Sexual intercourse within a place of worship would make the actors liable under this section.[xi]\nIndignity to Human Corpse and Disturbing Funeral Rites\nShowing any manner of disrespect to a human corpse disturbing the performance of funeral rites is a criminal offence under Section 297. The word ‘disturbance’ means any form of active interference or the hindrance to the performance of the funeral ceremonies. In Basir-ul-Huq v. State of West Bengal[xii] the mother of one DhirendranathBera died. He along with others took the corpse to the cremation grounds. In the meantime, the accused filed a complaint with the police stating that Dhirendranath had throttled his mother to death. When the pyre was ablaze, the accused along with the sub-inspector arrived at the crematorium. The accused persuaded the policeman that if the flames were extinguished that the marks of injury would be found on the body. The fire was hence extinguished but no marks were found. Dhirendranath filed a complaint against the accused under Section 297 and stated that a prior enmity caused a mala fide intention to hurt his religious sentiments which caused him to trespass on the cremation grounds and cause the dead body to be desecrated. The accused was convicted and sentenced to three months rigorous imprisonment.\nOUTRAGING OR WOUNDING RELIGIOUS FEELINGS\nSection 295A. Deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs\nWhoever, with deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any class of citizens of India,by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend tothree years, or with fine, or with both.\nSection 298. Uttering, words, etc., with deliberate intent to wound the religious feelings of any person\nWhoever, with the deliberate intention of wounding the religious feelings of any person, utters any word or makes any sound in the hearing of that person or makes any gesture in the sight of that person or places, any object in the sight of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.\nThese sections of the Indian Penal Code relate to acts done deliberately with an intent to outrage, wound or insult the religious feelings or sentiments of any persons. Section 295A deals with actions intended to outrage the religious feelings or insult the religious beliefs or the religion of a particular class of persons that can be termed as ‘deliberate and malicious’; whereas Section 298 makes punishable those ‘deliberate’ acts of verbal or visible representation that intend to wound the religious feelings of another.\nThe difference in the two sections can be seen from the way they have been worded. Section 295A refers to ‘deliberate and malicious intention’ of ‘outraging’ the religious feelings of a ‘class of citizens of India’. Section 298 makes any utterances done or gestures made with ‘deliberate intention’ of ‘wounding’ religious feelings of a ‘person’ punishable. When contrasted, it is seen that the word ‘outraging’ is much stronger than the word ‘wounding’ and hence the offence under Section 295A is more serious than the offence under Section 298. As a result, it is observed that the punishment under Section 295A is simple or rigorous imprisonment extending up to three years whereas that under Section 298 is either type of imprisonment which may extend to a term of one year or with a fine or both.\nThese sections allow fair latitude for religious discussions and debates but at the same time prevents people from offering under the pretext of such discussion any intentional insults to what is held sacred by others.\nDISTURBING RELIGIOUS ASSEMBLIES\nWhoever voluntarily causes disturbance to any assembly lawfully engaged in the performance of religious worship, or religious ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.\nThe essential ingredients of this section are:\n- There must be an assembly which is engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremony\n- Such assembly and performance of such ceremony should be lawful\n- The accused must cause disturbance to such assembly\n- The accused must do so voluntarily\nThis section affords special protection to congregational worship. It does not cover individual worship. A religious procession is regarded as a lawful assembly unless it interferes with the ordinary use of the streets by the public or contravenes any rules or regulations.\nWhere a mosque situated on the banks of a highway, passing by in a procession with music playing loudly at a time when prayers are going on will be an offence as such music would necessarily disturb the congregation engaged in prayer.[xiii]\nEdited by Sinjini Majumdar\n[i]Gopinath Puja Panda Samanta v.

{"question":"What are the key drivers behind the increasing popularity of Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) in the renewable energy sector?","answer":"Two main developments are driving the popularity of PPAs. First, subsidies for renewable energies in Europe are being reduced or phased out, particularly in offshore wind, forcing operators to find new ways to hedge their investment risk. Second, companies are increasingly seeking energy solutions to meet their sustainability targets, with a growing demand for direct supply of green power. By 2017, almost half of Fortune 500 companies had already set climate targets, with interest now expanding beyond just IT companies to all sectors.","context":["Power purchase agreements, PPAs, are a growing focus for renewable power producers industry. But what is a PPA and what are the opportunities? Hanno Mieth from Vattenfall Trading gives an overview.\nAs subsidies are set to be phased out in the coming years, energy companies need new ways to secure the investments in renewable power. Therefore long-term electricity supply agreements like PPAs (power purchase agreements) are becoming a growing focus for operators of solar and wind-power installations, as well as large electricity consumers and traders. At the same time, there is growing demand on the market for ‘truly’ green electricity.\nWhat are PPAs? What types of PPA are there? What is the outlook for PPAs and what might the formulas for functioning PPAs be? Hanno Mieth, responsible for the development of power purchase agreements for existing wind turbines and new solar power investments in Germany at Vattenfall Trading, provides an overview.\nWhat is a (corporate) power purchase agreement?\nA power purchase agreement is a long-term electricity supply agreement between an installation operator (seller) and an electricity customer (buyer). The buyer can be an intermediary energy trader or energy supplier, or a major direct industrial consumer such as an IT company who need renewable power for its data centres. The agreements are generally signed for a period of up to 10 years, though shorter-term PPAs are also possible.\nPurchasing power directly through agreements like these is nothing new in the energy sector. It has long been common practice to conclude direct agreements with energy-intensive customers who want long-term price certainty. In principle, the agreements can cover all types of energy supply, including electricity generated by fossil fuels. However, in today’s energy world, corporate power purchase agreements are understood as the supply of power generated by renewable energy from a wind turbine, photovoltaic installation, biomass plant or hydroelectric plant to an industrial end consumer.\nThe generator of the renewable energy receives a fixed price per megawatt hour, meaning that it can expect fixed returns on its investment and offer the bank the certainty it requires for the loans. The high-demand customer can therefore ensure that its renewable energy supply comes either directly from a specific plant, or from a green portfolio, at a fixed price for the duration of the agreement. The proof of the green quality and origin of the energy supply is provided by the guarantees of origin (GO) of the energy-generating plants.\nWhy are PPAs in vogue?\nThere are currently two developments taking place on the market that are reinforcing each other.\nOn the one hand, subsidies for renewable energies in Europe are falling or are due to be phased out in the near future, particularly in offshore wind. This trend is set to continue. Without subsidies, operators of renewable energy plants must find ways of hedging at least part of their investment risk. One approach is to sell future generation to a buyer.\nOn the other hand, companies are increasingly looking for energy solutions to meet their ambitious sustainability targets, and are increasingly demanding a direct supply of green power. Almost half of Fortune 500 companies had already set climate targets by 2017. While these primarily included global IT companies with a large energy demand, like Facebook and Microsoft, there is now a growing interest from all sectors.\nWhat types of PPAs are there?\nPPAs differ according to who the owner of the electricity generation is and who their customer is – as well as according to the type of power transmission.\nThe developer and operator of the wind or solar farm sells the electricity directly to a high-demand customer. This ensures stable prices and access to green energy. The seller is not dependent on subsidies, has a lower market risk and secures stable revenues in the long term. For example, in autumn 2017, Vattenfall and Microsoft concluded a 10-year agreement in the Netherlands for the provision of green energy from the new Wieringermeer wind farm, which is located right next to the data centre.\nVattenfall and Microsoft signed a ten-year power purchase agreement in 2017 where the Wieringermeer wind farm will power Microsoft’s nearby data centre.\nThis type of power purchase agreement also involves the physical supply of green electricity. However, as the plant is not located on the premises of the high-demand customer, the electricity is supplied via the grid. The electricity is purchased and sold by a trader who usually offers other services, such as for balancing power, forecasts or optimisation of electricity generation. An example of this is the agreement concluded between Vattenfall and Facebook in May 2018 to supply a data centre in Denmark and Sweden, which are supplied with wind energy from Norway.\nVattenfall has today contracted around 4.5 gigawatts of renewable energy from third party producers and aims to almost double this figure by 2020.\nSynthetic or Financial PPA\nThere are also PPAs involving an electricity supply which is virtual rather than physical. Here, the green electricity is traded on the electricity exchange. In this type of agreement, the market risk is hedged and the electricity supply is covered by guarantees of origin (GO).\nHow will the framework conditions for PPAs in Europe develop?\n“Corporate power purchase agreements gained momentum last year as a result of falling prices for generating renewable energy, the phasing out of EEG subsidies, and the growing demand from companies for green energy”, explains Hanno Mieth. “In our view, this trend is set to continue. As one of the major players on the market with many years’ experience, we have both the technical expertise and a broad range of renewable generation options, and are able to offer this to industrial customers as well as developers.”\nAs Hanno Mieth summarises with regard to the future: “We anticipate – and we’re not the only market players who take this view – that subsidies will fall as a result of tendering. As of 2021, the first wind farms will also no longer receive EEG subsidies and will have to be refinanced going forward. In contrast to the Nordic markets, in Germany we will see more short-term PPAs for one to five years, as subsidies for the plants will gradually be phased out. There will therefore be an increasing supply of green electricity on the market available for PPAs.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:680c5156-8c23-459b-9019-d98a66e8c3ad>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the logistics involved in serving braised meats at large events, and what temperature control requirements make them a safer choice compared to other proteins?","answer":"Braised meats like short ribs are ideal for large events because they 'thrive in sustained heat' due to their muscle and fiber structure, making them more forgiving in temperature control. Unlike proteins like beef filet that require precise temperature timing for medium-rare service, braised meats can be held safely in warming cabinets for extended periods without compromising quality. From a food safety perspective, proper temperature control is crucial - meats must reach specific safe cooking temperatures (165°F for poultry, 145°F for other cuts) and be maintained at safe holding temperatures. For large events, this reliability is particularly important as service timing can vary by 15 minutes or more, and food often needs to be ready well before service begins. The science of muscle structure in braised meats allows for better temperature stability during extended holding periods, reducing food safety risks that could arise from temperature fluctuations.","context":["By Steve Poses\nFor many years, Frog Commissary has had both the honor and challenge of catering April’s annual Franklin Institute Awards gala, our most important event. We think of it as our annual reminder to The Franklin Institute as to why they keep us around. We’ll go behind the scenes to show you what it takes to plan for a gala for 750 to 900 people that will be praised year after year.\nThursday, April 19th 2018, 11:30PM\nA staff of about 150 chefs, cooks, porters, waiters, supervisors, buffet stylists, supervisors, captains and managers are wrapping up.\nUnlike your “typical” dinner in a hotel ballroom or convention center, purposed just for such an occasion, “Awards” takes place throughout The Franklin Institute in spaces designed to demonstrate the wonders of science and not the wonders of the caterer. Our kitchen is nearly a city block away from where we serve guests and, depending on the layout that year, one or two floors below. Every detail down to the last carrot must be planned and that planning starts immediately following the “best ever” accolades.\nBy morning we’re talking about 2019’s dinner and beginning the planning process anew.\nWe have both an internal debriefing and a follow-up with The Franklin Institute. What worked well? What could we have done better? We keep detailed notes for the ever-thickening file.\nFrog’s planning is currently led by Connie who has been with us for 27 years and worked her first Awards dinner in 1991. Over time she has ascended to catering account manager. Connie’s sudden initiation into Awards planning began on March 30, 2014, a date she remembers well, because the person doing it left on painfully short notice. In addition she had to oversee a wedding that weekend and figure out and place the entire Awards equipment rental order, which included everything we needed from tables and chairs and food warmers to coffee cups, dessert forks and everything in between. Connie worked 24 straight hours but she pulled it off with aplomb.\nConnie’s “client/partner” on The Franklin Institute side is Marci, Director of Donor Relations. Marci and Connie plan a myriad of events together over the course of the year, all important but none more so than Awards.\nThe Planning Cycle\nAfter the post-event debriefing, things remain quiet for a few months. In late summer, Marci tells Connie what museum spaces will be involved for the coming year and how many guests are expected. Connie can start preliminary floor plans.\nOne of the challenges to the evening is that it consists of several parts across many physical spaces: The Laureates “green room” reception, cocktails, cocktail buffets and hors d’oeuvres in the Atrium; the Awards ceremony in Franklin Hall with refreshments and bar in overflow space (in 2018, that was Franklin Foodworks). Guests move to dinner in typically three or four spaces throughout the Institute, a pre-set first course followed by entree; and then guests move back to the Atrium for desserts and post-dinner beverages. Finally, they enjoy “To-Go Dessert” and coffee.\nFall marks the start of serious menu planning with the goal of initially presenting lots of options. Menu ideas need to encompass butlered and stationary hors d’oeuvres, cocktail stations, a house cocktail, first courses and entrees. For dessert there are multiple sweets, both butlered and stationary. The food needs to be new and different without being too different. Seasonality is always a planning parameter.\nAround this time, a date is set for the Awards Tasting in January or February, and is typically attended by the event chair and co-chair, Institute President Larry Dubinsky and members of his staff. Marci and Beth also attend. A few weeks before the tasting, Connie gets the selections narrowed from our long list. Things that were just chef ideas get kitchen-tested and reworked.\nThe tasting begins with house cocktail alternatives, helpful in setting the mood. The chair and co-chair are never bashful and always respectful in expressing their opinions. A parade of hors d’oeuvres begins to arrive. No drum roll. Lots of discussion. Size, shape and flavor analyzed. As we transition to the dinner portion, wines are tasted and selected\n. After many awkward years of presenting a few samples of each course and cutting it up and sharing around the table, we now present a single “presentation plate” and small “salad plate” portions for each. Finally, guests taste the butlered dessert options, bigger than a dessert bite, but small enough that you could have two of them. Every hors d’oeuvres, presentation plate and dessert is carefully photographed for reference.\nAnnual Question. Annual Answer.\nScience is at the core of The Franklin Institute’s mission. The Awards themselves annually celebrate outstanding scientists from around the world. Despite our long history of successfully serving boneless short rib of beef as the entree protein, we return to the same question annually: Can we serve something different this year? After one year of wildly different filet temperatures for the 800 guests, we are cautious.\nOne issue is that the call time to begin finishing the entree in the kitchen is well before the program ends. Entrees, including the protein, vegetable, starch, sauce, garnishes plus, and just in case, fish and vegetarian alternatives, need to be ready to move from a dozen warming cabinets to be plated from nooks and crannies adjacent to the dining rooms throughout The Franklin Institute. Years of experience have taught us how long it takes 800 guests to move to their dining room and after chatting tableside, finally sit to their pre-set first course. We know exactly when we will serve the entree, well, give or take 15 minutes. So imagine trying to serve a perfectly medium rare beef filet, no less a sirloin with that window. The beauty of a braised hunk of meat is that it thrives in sustained heat. It is inherent in the science of the muscle and fiber structure of the short rib. So the annual answer to that annual question: It would be a mistake to serve anything other than the boneless short rib of beef.\nThe Hardest Thing\nWhen questioned about the hardest thing about Awards menu planning, Connie says it’s coming up with the To-Go sweet. Exemplary hospitality sends guests off sweetly and we added this lovely touch several years ago, at Marci’s request. This began as relatively simple caramel popcorn and, in the spirit of now top this, has become the annual Olympics of menu planning with a packaging twist. This year, we offer a pair of dessert bars, Raspberry Granola and Chocolate Nutella, carefully and snuggly placed in clear plastic containers, demarcated by Frog Commissary labels and festive ribbons. The bars have a good shelf life so we are able to complete this task the day before. A major plus.\nWe nearly always leave the tasting with 90 percent of the menu finalized. Further discussion between Marci, the committee chair and co-chair, Connie and our kitchen resolve the cocktail stations and miscellaneous desserts. We are now ready to move to the actual production planning stage. That means time at the computer inputting the hundreds of details that go into producing an event like this. Imagine the Eagles planning for game day, except much more complicated. You see, a football game is 60 minutes. This event lasts more than five hours.\nThursday, April 11, 2019 – The Franklin Institute Awards\nThe Eagles get to plan each week with a singular focus on a 60-minute game. We plan for our own Super Bowl-level challenge as we manage all the unending components of providing food services for The Franklin Institute and its visitors. This year, as an added bonus, we have the preview opening of the Marvel exhibit the day after the Awards Dinner. And a wedding for 250 on Saturday. Oh, and the Marvel exhibit opens to the public on Saturday. Of course, we are open on Sunday.\nFood prep begins about three days out and intensifies as we approach Thursday. As testament to the importance of the annual Awards Dinner, The Franklin Institute is closed to the public the day of Awards. This is a blessing as it enables us to focus primarily on Awards, except for all the other things we need to be ready for. This is event planning and production at its highest level executed by a team of remarkably experienced, organized and hard-working pros.\nMoving into High Gear\nOur leadership is executing its pre-game and game-day plan. Dining rooms are set Wednesday evening into the night. Of course, every table, tablecloth, chair, glass, plate, knife, fork and spoon must find its way to each area in the exact number needed. Because the Institute is open, these supplies are stashed out of site. Bars are staged. Cocktail stations platters and props are put in place.\nBy 8AM Thursday, the kitchen is in full production mode. Many people who arrive at 8AM will be here at 11:30 PM. And yikes, back Friday morning.\nAn early service staff arrives to check tables most importantly, to make sure all glassware is polished. Flatware soldier straight. More waves of staff arrive as the afternoon wanes. It’s all synchronized. By 4PM, all 150 staff are busy with planned tasks. By 4:00PM, cold hors d’oeuvres and cocktail stations have been moved from the kitchen to a draped area in the Atrium. Hot hors d’oeuvres follow by 5PM. The formal event begins at 5:30 so everything is ready to go by 5:15. Bartenders in place. Drink butlers at the ready. All buffets set up, including hot components.\nThe Game Begins\nAs guests arrive, first course mise en place begins moving to the plating areas, hopefully near their respective dining rooms. First course, for reasons of sanity, are always pre-set and room temperature. Teams in each area begin the elaborate plating in accord with the tasting photo. (See photo.) All busing areas have been set up. At 6:30, we see the first call of guests file into Franklin Hall for the 7PM awards presentations. This is simulcast in an overflow area where we will maintain a bar and cocktail fare.\nOne hundred and fifty staff need to know what they are doing during each phase of the evening. While guests are in Franklin Hall, the Atrium cocktail break-down starts and we re-set for post-dinner festivities including dessert stations, butlered desserts, bars. Dessert To-Go is staged in Jordon Lobby. Most staff who worked cocktails move to dining rooms to finish getting first courses to tables and pour water. Some remain to handle the transition. In the kitchen, sauce is finished, vegetables set at the ready, starch distributed to hotel pans. Vegan entrees fired. Thankfully, by virtue of the science of short ribs, our primary entree protein is sitting happily in its warmers. Approximately a half-hour before our best-guess serving time, all this needs to move in just the right quantities to just the right locations. Thank God for wheels.\nAs 800 or so guests take their seats, servers pour wine. Entree service lines set up, including damp coffee filters at the ready to wipe away any stray drops of sauce. As first courses are cleared, food is moved to entree service lines where staff has been assigned to each discrete step of plating. A service line can quickly produce up to about 100 guests. A typical Awards dinner for 800 takes eight lines. Assuming a line takes six staff, that’s 48 staff needed to plate. Once the entree is served, everyone breathes a sigh of relief. Since desserts take place back in the Atrium, there is no dessert to plate individually. So, all that’s left is moving everything back out.\nBack in the Atrium, kitchen and service staff is at the ready. Dessert stations set. Butlered dessert production in place. Coffee piping hot in samovars. Flutes at attention on trays ready for their pour of sparkling wine. Cue the music. Behind the scenes throughout The Franklin Institute staff is breaking down the event. By 11:30, nearly all guests have gone. The Institute’s development department is breathing their own sigh of relief, topped off with a little sparkling wine.\nAt night’s end, there’s a mix of joy and exhaustion. The Franklin Institute has a remarkable mission. The Franklin Institute Awards is the annual homage to that mission. Frog Commissary is proud to play our part, year after year. We bask in the glow of praise and the satisfaction of a job well done, until it begins yet again.","Temperature control is a critical part of food safety management for food handlers. Food handlers must always be aware of the temperature at which foods are stored and served, along with the risks posed by fluctuations in temperature.\nA breakdown in temperature control can lead to unsafe food handling practices. It may even result in food poisoning or other illnesses.\nWhat Is Temperature Control?\nTemperature control for food handlers is the practice of controlling the temperature of food products, so they can be stored and served safely. This can be accomplished by using specialized equipment or developing a system that monitors each product’s temperature.\nWhen temperatures are controlled, food handlers can maintain safe conditions for customers, employees, and themselves. The best way to manage this process is with a temperature-controlled storage unit or freezer cabinet.\nThese cabinets allow you to regulate temperatures in different areas of the storage unit to ensure that all foods are correctly stored at their ideal temperatures.\nWhy Is Temperature Control Important?\nTemperature control is essential in food handlers because it helps to prevent foodborne illness. Food handlers need to know how to maintain proper temperature control when working with food and ensure that it stays at the desired temperature.\nTemperature control is also essential for food handlers because it allows them to monitor the quality of the food they are handling so that they can make sure that it is safe for consumption.\nHow temperature can affect food safety\nTemperature is one of the most critical factors in food safety. It can affect the growth of bacteria, viruses, and parasites that cause foodborne illness.\nFoodborne illness is caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites that grow in food if it is not stored at the correct temperature. This can happen if you leave your food out too long or need to refrigerate it properly after cooking it.\nThe most common bacteria that causes foodborne illness is Listeria monocytogenes, which can be found in raw meat and vegetables. It can also grow in dairy products, such as cheese and milk.\nFoodborne illness can be severe, especially for young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea.\nMaintaining proper storage temperatures.\nTemperature control is essential for food safety. By maintaining proper storage temperatures, you can ensure that your food doesn’t spoil or become unsafe.\nWhen storing food, it is crucial to maintain proper storage temperatures. The following procedures should be followed when storing food:\n- Store the food at the lowest temperature that can be maintained without causing any damage.\n- Ensure that the room temperature is within 4°F to 40°F [2°C to 25°C] of the correct temperature.\n- Do not store perishable foods in rooms where they will be exposed to high heat or direct sunlight, as these conditions could cause spoilage or deterioration of the food’s flavor and texture.\n- Do not store perishable foods in areas where they may be exposed to high humidity or large amounts of condensation, as these conditions can cause mold and spoilage in food items such as fruits and vegetables, meat products, and fish products.\n- Always label perishable foods with their date of purchase, expiry date, storage instructions, and storage conditions so that they are visible and understood by all personnel involved in their handling (e.g., cashiers who handle them at checkout counters).\nSafe cooking temperatures\nIf you’re looking to ensure that your food is cooked at the right temperature, these are things you should note:\nThe safe cooking temperature for meat is 165°F.\nThe safe cooking temperatures for meats should be:\n– Steak: 145°F (63°C)\n– Pork chops: 145°F (63°C)\n– Chicken breasts: 160°F (71°C)\n– Ground beef: 160°F (71°C)\nThe safe cooking temperature for poultry is 165°F.\nThe safe cooking temperature for fish is 145°F.\nHigh-Risk Food Needing Temperature Control\nIf you’re working in a restaurant or other food handling facility, some foods are high-risk and require temperature control. High-risk food requiring temperature control includes:\n- Meats and poultry\n- Fish and shellfish\n- Milk and dairy products\n- Raw fruits and vegetables\nHow To Be Mindful Of Temperature Control\n- Check the temperature regularly.\n- Refrain from relying on memory.\n- Please don’t rely on others to do it for you.\n- Keep food out of the fridge for a short time, even if it looks okay when checked earlier. The quality may deteriorate over time and cause illness or poisoning.\n- Check that temperature first before leaving food in an oven.\nRules And Regulation: Storage, Display, Handling, And Transport Of Temperatures\nThe food code is a set of rules and regulations that govern the storage, display, handling, and transport of temperatures. It was developed by the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) in 2010 to ensure that all people handling food are trained safely.\nThe FSMA requires food handlers who work with perishable products such as meat or poultry to wash their hands regularly before each procedure and after touching any surface where bacteria could be present—even if it looks clean!\nBecause this practice helps prevent cross-contamination across multiple items in your inventory at once (like when you’re making sandwiches), it’s essential for everyone involved in this industry: from farmers growing produce for supermarkets all over town down through retail sales clerks who ship out orders within hours after filling them up at their convenience store locations every day after work hours end…\nHow To Keep Temperature Records\nIt is essential to keep track of the temperatures of your food as a food handler so that you can ensure that you are following proper procedures. You should also ensure that all employees have access to a thermometer and a digital or meat thermometer.\nIf you need access to these tools or are too expensive for your budget, consider using an instant-read food thermometer instead. This type of device is small enough to fit in your pocket and accurate enough for most applications; however, it does require calibration each time it is used (which can take up some time).\nTemperature control is a critical part of food safety. Knowing how your product is stored and handled and the temperature required for proper cooking and safe consumption is essential. You can use these tips to become more mindful about keeping records of your food handler procedures so that you can keep track of them at all times."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:872a5018-e032-40f8-a1e8-dbf924849d32>","<urn:uuid:5a6b25aa-4009-41cb-95df-c80894901b6f>"],"error":null}

Bateman, 2) The Liver Unit directed by Dr. Allan G. Redeker, and 3) Family Planning Services run by Dr. Carol E. Henneman. The hospital operated until February 9, 1971, when it was badly damaged by the 6.6 magnitude Sylmar earthquake.","context":["The Rich History of JWCH Institute, Inc\nThe County of Los Angeles purchased the John Wesley Methodist Hospital and renamed it the John Wesley County Hospital.\nOctober 6, 1960\nA group of Los Angeles County doctors stationed at the hospital had the foresight to create a private, non-profit public benefit corporation dealing with health services, health education and medical research. This private corporation would then provide or augment services of the hospital through additional funding obtained either through grants, contracts or private funds. They named the newly formed corporation “The Attending Staff Association of John Wesley County Hospital, Inc.”\nThe activities of the Association included: Oncology/Western Cancer Study Group with Dr. Joseph R. Bateman; The Liver Unit with Dr. Allan G. Redeker, and; Family Planning Services with Dr. Carol E. Henneman.\nFebruary 9, 1971\nThe John Wesley County Hospital is badly damaged in the 6.6 magnitude Sylmar earthquake. Parts of the hospital facility can not be used.\nThe John Wesley County Hospital was closed and in its place a new facility was built. That facility was initially known as the John Wesley Comprehensive Health Center which provided outpatient services only. It was renamed and is now known as the H. Claude Hudson Comprehensive Health Center. At that time many of the county doctors initially involved with The Attending Staff Association of John Wesley County Hospital moved to other locations including Rancho Los Amigos Hospital and Los Angeles County USC Medical Center. The move also forced the Attending Staff Association of John Wesley County Hospital to split into two organizations, with Dr. Robert Peters forming the Liver Research and Education Foundation at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital, Inc. Between the two corporations, monies were allocated based on where the doctor-in-charge was located.\nDr. Carol E. Henneman, Dr. Sidney E. Wechsler and Dr. Edward Lenoski were left with approximately $50,000 in assets and renamed The Attending Staff Association of John Wesley County Hospital, Inc as JWCH Institute, Inc. JWCH Institute, Inc. also obtained a DBA (doing business as) John Wesley Community Health Institute, Inc.\nPhyllis Paxton was hired as Executive Director of JWCH Institute. JWCH Institute successfully starts its Reproductive Awareness Program for at risk teenagers; its netVan (non-emergency transportation) system in Skid Row for Homeless and underserved persons; it’s HIV services programs, Skid Row Medical Outreach Team and opens the two exam-room Lynwood Family Planning clinic.\nThe County of Los Angeles puts out to competitive bidding several of its outpatient health facilities during the first round of the Los Angeles County 1115 Waiver. Part of this bidding includes the Los Angeles County Clinic at the Weingart Center Association in Skid Row. JWCH Institute successfully competes and is granted status as a Strategic Partner in its first Public Private Partnership program and takes over the medical operations of the Los Angeles County Clinic at the Weingart Center Association. The clinic is renamed the JWCH Weingart Clinic in Skid Row.\nExecutive Director Phyllis Paxton retires after eight years of service. The agency is now a strategic partner under the Los Angeles County Public Private Partnership program. Roger Johnson, M.Ed., is Chair of the Board of Directors.\nThe JWCH Institute, Inc. Board of Directors hires Alvaro (Al). P. Ballesteros as Chief Executive Officer. Roger Johnson is Chair of the JWCH Board of Directors. The Board also strategically makes the decision to seek federal designation as a community health center, FQHC.\nAl Ballesteros appoints internal JWCH staff to positions of leadership including Dr. Paul Gregerson, MD, MBA as Chief Medical Officer; appoints Andy Irie as Director of Administration and later Chief Administrative Officer; appoints Jeny Argame, RN, MBA as Chief Nursing Officer and Jeanne Lam, as Chief Financial Officer. The team begins to work towards achieving federal designation as a community health center and to enhance its service delivery system.\nJWCH takes over the operations of the clinic at the PATH Mall (People Assisting the Homeless Mall). The PATH Mall provides a one-stop shop for homeless persons to acquire housing, medical services and other support services.\nThe Los Angeles based Weingart Foundation launches the Skid Row Homeless Health Initiative based on a report completed by Michael Cousineau, Ph.D., entitled: “Neglect on the Streets: The Health and Mental Health Status and Access to Care for the Homeless Adults and Children in Central Los Angeles” published in June 2003. The report calls attention to the major role JWCH Institute could play to improve the safety-net. The Weingart Foundation is successful in bringing several major foundations to the initiative which represents a substantial, unprecedented investment into the medical and health infrastructure of skid row by philantrophy. JWCH leadership takes on critical positions within the Initiative and assists in outlining a plan of action and programs to improve access and health outcomes for the homeless.\nJWCH Institute, Inc., receives its first direct-Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grant for HIV prevention and testing in Skid Row.

{"question":"How do the symptoms and prevalence of lactose intolerance vary across different ethnic groups, and what milk alternatives are recommended for those affected by this condition?","answer":"Lactose intolerance affects ethnic groups differently, being more common in people with Asian, African, Native American, or Mediterranean ancestry than in northern and western Europeans. In African Americans, symptoms can appear as early as age 2, while in Caucasians, it typically affects children older than 5. By age 20, approximately 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance. For those affected, several alternatives are available: soy milk, which is a nutritional powerhouse with 6 grams of protein per cup; rice milk, which is good for people with multiple food allergies; and almond milk, which provides 450mg of calcium per cup. Additionally, lactose-intolerant individuals can try lactose-free milk or take lactase enzyme supplements.","context":["Lactose intolerance is the inability to digest lactose. Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk and other dairy products.\nLactase deficiency; Milk intolerance; Disaccharidase deficiency; Dairy product intolerance\nCauses, incidence, and risk factors:\nLactose intolerance happens when the small intestine does not make enough of the enzyme lactase. Enzymes help the body absorb foods. Not having enough lactase is called lactase deficiency.\nBabies' bodies make this enzyme so they can digest milk, including breast milk.\nPremature babies sometimes have lactose intolerance. Children who were born at full term usually do not show signs of lactose intolerance until they are at least 3 years old.\nLactose intolerance can begin at different times in life. In Caucasians, it usually affects children older than age 5. In African Americans, lactose intolerance often occurs as early as age 2.\nLactose intolerance is more common in people with Asian, African, Native American, or Mediterranean ancestry than it is among northern and western Europeans.\nLactose intolerance is very common in adults and is not dangerous. Approximately 30 million American adults have some amount of lactose intolerance by age 20.\nCauses of lactose intolerance include:\n- Bowel surgery\n- Infections in the small intestine from viruses or bacteria, which may damage the cells lining the intestine (most often in children)\n- Intestinal diseases such as celiac sprue\nSymptoms often occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after you eat or drink milk products, and are often relieved by not eating or drinking milk products. Large doses of milk products may cause worse symptoms.\nInfants or children may have slow growth or weight loss.\nSigns and tests:\nOther intestinal problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome , may cause the same symptoms as lactose intolerance.\nTests to help diagnose lactose intolerance include:\nDecreasing or removing milk products from the diet usually improves the symptoms.\nMost people with low lactase levels can drink 2 - 4 ounces of milk at one time (up to one-half cup) without having symptoms. Larger (more than 8 oz.) servings may cause problems for people with lactase deficiency.\nThese milk products may be easier to digest:\n- Buttermilk and cheeses (they have less lactose than milk)\n- Fermented milk products, such as yogurt\n- Goat's milk (but drink it with meals, and make sure it is supplemented with essential amino acids and vitamins if you give it to children)\n- Ice cream, milkshakes, and aged or hard cheeses\n- Lactose-free milk and milk products\n- Lactase-treated cow's milk for older children and adults\n- Soy formulas for infants younger than 2 years\n- Soy or rice milk for toddlers\nYou can add lactase enzymes to regular milk or take these enzymes in capsule or chewable tablet form.\nNot having milk in the diet can lead to a shortage of calcium, vitamin D, riboflavin, and protein.\nYou may need to find new ways to get calcium into your diet (you need 1,200 - 1,500 mg of calcium each day):\n- Take calcium supplements\n- Eat foods that have more calcium (leafy greens, oysters, sardines, canned salmon, shrimp, and broccoli)\n- Drink orange juice that contains added calcium\nRead food labels. Lactose is also found in some non-milk products -- including some beers.\nSymptoms usually go away when you remove milk products or other lactose containing products from the diet.\nWeight loss and malnutrition are possible complications.\nCalling your health care provider:\nCall your health care provider if:\n- You have an infant younger than 2 or 3 years old who has symptoms of lactose intolerance.\n- Your child is growing slowly or not gaining weight.\n- You or your child has symptoms of lactose intolerance and you need information on food substitutes.\n- Your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment, or you develop new symptoms.\nThere is no known way to prevent lactose intolerance.\nIf you have the condition, avoiding or restricting the amount of milk products in your diet can reduce or prevent symptoms.\nGenauer CH, Hammer HF.

June 2009.","The milk aisle is packed with options. Which is best for you? We’ve got the lowdown on 15 varieties of dairy, soy, nut, and seed milks.\nCow’s Milk: Skim\nGrocery stores have more milk options than ever, including plant, nut, and seed versions you may not have heard of. Classic cow’s milk is a good source of three nutrients most Americans don’t get enough of: calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. Nonfat, or skim, is made by skimming the cream from whole milk. At about 90 calories and zero fat per cup, it’s a good option for milk drinkers trying to lose weight.\nCow’s Milk: 1% and 2%\nAll four types of cow’s milk (skim, 1%, 2%, and whole) have the same amount of protein, calcium, and vitamins. The difference is in calories and fat. A cup of 1% has 102 calories and 1.5 grams of saturated fat. A cup of 2% has 3.1 grams of saturated fat. Both have some of the creaminess that skim milk lacks. If you’re trying to switch to non-fat milk, you might start with these to adjust to the taste difference. They can also be good options for kids who need to drink less juice or soda.\nCow’s Milk: Whole\nWhole milk, which is 3.5% milk fat, is closest to the liquid that comes out of the cow before processing. Who should drink it: Babies between 1 and 2 years old, whose growing brains need a higher-fat diet, and adults who could use more calories. If you just love the taste of whole milk, it’s OK to indulge. Pair it with a high-fiber cereal and then watch your saturated fats for the rest of the day.\nBesides being a kids’ favorite, chocolate milk may be a good post-workout recovery drink. There’s nothing special about the chocolate, though; flavored milks (strawberry and vanilla, too) have the ideal 4:1 ratio of carbohydrates to protein the body needs for muscle recovery and rebuilding after exercise. These drinks have the same nutrients as regular milk, but they have added sugar.\nSome people have trouble digesting lactose, the natural sugar in dairy foods. The problem, known as lactose intolerance, can cause bloating, gas, and diarrhea. But lactose-free milk has been treated, so it doesn’t cause those problems. It has the same nutrition as cow’s milk. But it tastes slightly sweeter because the lactose has been broken down into simple sugars.\nIn the plus column, a cup of this drink has tons of protein — 9 grams per cup, the most of any milk. It’s also richer in calcium than skim, with 35% of what you need each day. The cons: It has 170 calories and 7 grams of saturated fat per cup, far more than whole cow’s milk. One study found that it had no clear nutritional advantage over cow’s milk, and if you’re allergic to cow’s milk, you’ll probably be allergic to this as well\nMade from ground soybeans soaked in water, it’s a nutrition powerhouse: All the benefits of cow’s milk from a nonanimal source. A cup of calcium-fortified nonsweetened soy milk has about 6 grams of protein, 6 grams of carbohydrates, and 450 milligrams of calcium. (Flavored versions can be high in added sugars.) It’s a good option for vegans, people who are lactose intolerant, or those with a dairy allergy. But if you go for a milk substitute, make sure your choice is fortified with calcium and vitamin D.\nMade from ground almonds and filtered water, one cup of almond milk can have fewer than 30 calories while packing 450 milligrams of calcium. That’s more than most cheese, yogurt, and soy milk. Keep in mind that the benefits don’t come close to what you get from an ounce of raw almonds, which have far more protein, fiber, and healthy fats. But it can be a good choice for people on a low-sugar diet, those with a dairy or soy allergy, and vegans who don’t like soy milk.\nRice milk has earned its place on the shelf as an easy-to-digest soy alternative that’s also nut- and gluten-free. It’s made from ground brown rice and water, and nutritionists recommend it for people with multiple food allergies. On the downside, a cup of unsweetened rice milk has no protein, and because it’s made from rice, it’s naturally high in carbohydrates.\nWith a sweet and creamy flavor, cashew milk is a popular option for nondairy cream soups, dressings, and sauces. Close in texture to whole milk, it has fewer calories than skim. One cup of fortified unsweetened cashew milk has 25 calories per serving, zero sugar, and also has 50% more calcium than dairy milk.\nMilk made from macadamia nuts is one more option for people on a plant-based diet. Like almond milk, a cup of it gives you 45% of your recommended daily calcium, but with about as much fat as 2% cow’s milk (5 grams per cup). Who should try it: Milk drinkers looking to avoid dairy, soy, and gluten.\nIt’s not just for pina coladas and curries — coconut milk is everywhere these days. But know the differences: Canned coconut milk is the liquid expressed from coconut meat. With 12 grams of fat per cup, it’s the nondairy equal of heavy cream. It’s a great substitute in soups, puddings, and vegan ice cream. “Coconut milk beverage,” found in the refrigerated section, is watered down to lower the calories and fat. One cup has 45 calories and 4 grams of saturated fat.\nHemp Seed Milk\nLovers of this drink say it’s thicker and creamier than soy milk, and not as grainy. Made from hemp seeds, a cup of unsweetened hemp milk is rich in omega-3 and omega-6 fats, and other nutrients. On the other hand, it has 80 calories per cup, which is higher than rice and almond milks. Another option for people who have multiple food allergies.\nFlax Seed Milk\nIt’s one of the newer milk substitutes to hit the shelves. It’s simply cold-pressed flax oil mixed with filtered water. At 25 calories per unsweetened cup, it’s much lower in calories than all the other milks on the shelf. Besides that, it boasts 1,200 milligrams of heart-healthy omega-3 fatty acids. Who should try it: Those looking for a dairy-free milk without the taste of soy or nuts.\nBuy or Make Your Own?\nBasic nut and seed milks are fairly easy to make: Simply soak, blend, and drain.

{"question":"What's the key difference between how participant autonomy is handled in general research ethics versus during the informed consent process?","answer":"In general research ethics, respect for participant autonomy is stated as a broad principle where research should respect rights, interests, values, and dignity of participants whenever possible. In contrast, during the informed consent process, autonomy is specifically implemented through detailed requirements including open communication, providing adequate time for review, ensuring privacy during discussions, and maintaining an ongoing dialogue throughout the study where participants must be explicitly informed of their right to withdraw at any time without consequences.","context":["Researchers and research teams are encouraged to engage in self-critical ethical reflection throughout the lifecycle of the research. They should design and conduct research in accordance with recognised best practice and ethical standards and ensure that at a minimum research is subject to appropriate professional and institutional oversight. In all cases, researchers and ROs must comply with all relevant legal requirements.\nEnsuring that all research is conducted ethically is a collective responsibility of the researchers, the ROs and the appropriate research ethics committee (REC); it is less about compliance and ‘getting through’ the ethics process, and more about mature, constructive and collaborative ethical deliberation, mutual learning and shared action aimed at maximising benefit and minimising harm.\nResearch should aim to maximise benefit for individuals and society and minimise risk and harm\nResearchers should ensure that their research is of benefit to participants, individuals, science and society, and be realistic about the benefits that the research is likely to deliver. Research may be considered ethical when there is a positive risk-benefit ratio - that is, the risks and intrusions for people taking part in research (and those affected by the research) are minimised and justified by the expected benefits for the participants, science or society.\nResearchers should consider the risks and benefits of their research at all stages of the project. They should endeavour to determine possible risks and risk management (not least through the methodological strategy and instruments they adopt) prior to the start of a project, which may then require more formal ethics review.\nOur ethics case studies illustrate how different projects cope with a range of different risks, and how they anticipate and deal with difficulties encountered in the research process.\nThe rights and dignity of individuals and groups should be respected\nResearch should be designed and conducted in a way that respects the rights, interests, values, dignity and (whenever possible) autonomy of research participants (including individuals, groups and communities). Ethics issues around privacy, equality, diversity, health and safety are especially likely to arise in research.\nWherever possible, participation should be voluntary and appropriately informed\nResearchers should inform participants of their right to refuse to participate free of consequences, and of their right to withdraw from the research for whatever reason they wish. Researchers should indicate the point at which data cannot be excluded, for example after data has been anonymised and amalgamated. Where this is the case, participants should be given a date after which they cannot withdraw consent or ask for data destruction.\nResearch should be conducted with integrity and transparency\nResearch should be conducted with integrity in a clearly transparent way. Integrity demands that there is a clear fit between what researchers say they will do and how they actually conduct the research. Transparent research will be delivered when researchers are clear about the nature of their research and communicate this appropriately to those involved, when researchers can be easily contacted and respond to queries, and when they are as open and accountable as possible.\nAs a signatory of the Universities UK Concordat to support research integrity (external website), the ESRC expects all individuals involved in those communities, including researchers (academic and non-academic), research support staff, research managers, administrators and collaborating research partners, to abide by the principles set out in the Concordat and to work with due respect for one another within a supportive and open environment.\nLines of responsibility and accountability should be clearly defined\nThere are interlocking responsibilities in creating ethical research. Researchers must exercise self-critical responsibility in the planning and conduct of their research. Research ethics committees and research organisations have a responsibility to guide and support researchers, especially when the research involves difficult ethical decisions. Researchers have a responsibility to respect the rights and dignity of research participants and users who, in turn, should treat researchers and the research process with appropriate respect, and not attempt to influence either in a way that would distort the research.\nThe principal investigator has primary responsibility for the ethical conduct of research. Responsibilities should be agreed and assigned from the outset of the project. This includes agreements with co-investigators and researchers, non-academic partners, collaborative academic research teams and gatekeepers.\nThe principal investigator should support ethical reflection within a team, even when this involves some appropriate delegation and review the ethics issues of the research before it commences. All researchers on a project should be able to demonstrate commitment to the ethics approach and ongoing ethics reflection. Where needed, the principal investigator and research team should engage with their REC throughout the lifecycle of the project. The responsibility to seek advice or further review from the REC lies with the principal investigator. It is the responsibility of all team members to raise ethics concerns that they identify or are brought to their attention with the principal investigator or, where necessary, the appropriate REC.\nThe independence of research should be maintained, and where conflicts of interest cannot be avoided they should be made explicit\nIndependence of research, which is built upon academic credentials and professional standards, expertise and experience, is free from personal, organisational and political bias, dishonesty, and considerations of gain and should be safeguarded at all times.\nResearchers should consider whether there is any actual or perceived conflict between the private interests of the researcher and the objectives of the research, or conflict between the interests of the researchers, research beneficiaries, research participants and participating organisations. Conflicts of interest should be disclosed and managed in line with RO policies.","Informed Consent In Research\nObtaining informed consent for a research study requires open and honest communication between the researcher and the study participant.\nObtaining informed consent for a research study requires open and honest communication between the researcher and the study participant. Much attention has been given to the consent document readability and its comprehension. However, it is important to remember that the document is a proxy and reference for a conversation. The conversation should be based upon the key elements of the consent document which include but are not limited to; the study objectives, procedures, duration, risks, benefits, alternative options, confidentiality of records, contact information for any participant questions, compensation if applicable, additional costs and compensation for research injury if applicable. It is essential that participants understand that participating in a research study is completely voluntary; they can withdraw from the study at any time or choose not to participate.\nInformed consent should be obtained after the participant has been presented with pertinent information, has had adequate time to review the consent document and have all questions answered. Consent should also be obtained prior to any study specific procedures. Participant privacy during the discussion is paramount and the environment should be free of undue influence and coercion from the research team.\n- Video Link: General Informed Consent Requirements\nFor high risk protocols (e.g., Phase l/ll, gene transfer) it may be prudent and/or recommended by the local IRB to include the use of an independent party to be involved in the consent process. An individual obtaining consent may (un)intentionally influence a participant’s decision to consent to a research study. The use of a Research Subject Advocate can improve objectivity in communicating the presented information about the study.\nIt is important to note that informed consent is a continuous dialogue with the participant which reinforces the key elements of initial consent throughout the duration of the study. New adverse events or important findings that may increase a participant’s risks or willingness to continue in the research study should be disclosed to the participants and to the IRB.\n- HRPP Policy on Documentation of the Informed Consent Process\n- HRPP Policy on Informed Consent Process and the Elements of Informed Consent\n- FDA: A guide to Informed Consent\n- 45 CFR 46: General Requirements of Informed Consent\n- OHRP: Informed Consent FAQ\n- FDA: 21 CFR 50\n- FDA : IDE Informed Consent\n- CCTS: Consent Template Language\n- The OSU CCTS maintains a listing of template language for various risks and procedures that can be copied and inserted to draft consent documents.

{"question":"Compare the layering approach used in modern sleeping bags with stretch systems versus the three-layer system used in extreme cold weather clothing - which aspects of insulation and heat retention are similar or different?","answer":"The stretch system in sleeping bags uses elastic in stitched areas to create a close fit while maintaining comfort, allowing the insulation to stay near the body for optimal heat retention. Similarly, the three-layer system in extreme cold weather clothing uses a base layer tight to the skin, insulating mid-layers, and a protective outer shell. Both approaches prioritize keeping insulation close to the body while preventing cold air infiltration. However, the cold weather clothing system is more complex, with each layer serving a specific purpose - the base layer managing moisture, mid-layer providing insulation, and outer layer blocking wind and water - while the sleeping bag's stretch system focuses primarily on maintaining optimal insulation positioning through elastic components.","context":["The history and evolution of Montbell sleeping bags\nFor overnight hikes or long trails, a good night's sleeping is extremely important. If fatigue carries over to the next day due to a lack of sleep, it can contribute to an inability to concentrate, which could possibly lead to a stumble and maybe even injury. \"Warmth\" especially is a crucial element that can determine whether or not you get a good night's sleep. Montbell Advising Director, Fumiaki Masaki will take us through a history of sleeping bags in Japan, the transitions in insulating materials, design and functionality, and the ever important concept of \"warmth\".\nIs \"warmth\" solely determined by insulation weight?\nUntil about 40 years ago, almost all insulation for sleeping bags was made with synthetic fibers. At the time, in order to increase heat retention it was necessary to increase the density of the insulation, which made the bag heavier. This is why it was thought that warmth was equal to the amount and density of insulation. The warmer the sleeping bag the bulkier it was, and the heavier the bag the more expensive.\nAt the time, there were down sleeping bags in circulation, which were half the weight and provided the same amount of warmth, but these items were used by a select group of experts who would go on expeditions overseas, and these bags were far beyond the reach of the everyday climber or hiker. In those days, sleeping bags from manufacturers in Europe, were extremely expensive and usually cost the average college graduate about 2 or 3 months worth of wages.\nAlthough, inexpensive down bags were available. In the 1960s, due to the Korean War, a large quantity of discarded bags from the U.S. Army would circulate in Japan, and local entrepreneurs started making their own versions, copying the structure and using synthetic fibers. In America and Europe these bags were known as \"mummy bags\", but in Japan they were called \"human-shaped\" because they were different from the envelope style bags and fit the human form. The very first sleeping bag I used was such a \"human-shaped\", and I remember that it was made without wasting materials and it was a really great bag.\nAt the time, synthetic insulations were made of nylon, Tetoron (polyester), and acrylic, but for sleeping bags, an acrylic fiber called Kanekalon was primarily used. Though it doesn't quite have the heat retaining properties of today's hollow fibers, the curved horse-shoe shaped fibers of Kanekalon would hold dead air, and therefore be warmer than other synthetic fibers.\nThe transition from \"Big and Warm\" to \"Small and Warm\"\nWith Japanese sleeping bags sticking to the standard that \"bigger was warmer\", a major turning point came in 1974, when the American company DuPont came out with a new sleeping bag insulation made from polyester fibers called Dacron Hollofil II. By producing these fibers in a hollow, macaroni-shaped structure, they could hold a significantly larger amount of dead air to retain warmth, making them fluffy and soft, lightweight and water resistant. Best of all was its amazing ability to recover loft, just like down, it could be compressed very small but would return to its normal size.\nAt the time, I was working on research and development for sleeping bags, and I immediately set about using this Dacron Hollofil II to develop products. Because this insulation had such high lofting properties, I wanted to make the sleeping bag's fabric as thin and lightweight as possible. I decided to use a slim computer ribbon tape-like material that was at the time the thinnest in the world, and produced only in Japan. Where we had once used 70-denier fabric, this new, thinner 40-denier fabric, made an incredibly lightweight sleeping bag.\nIn 1976, after approximately 2 years of development, we released a new sleeping bag with the marketing message \"compact, lightweight, and warm\". But at first we struggled to gain acceptance. When we took it around to local wholesalers in the southern region of Japan, they told us, \"This little bag is the same price as a bigger bag? No way.\" So next we decided to try selling it in Tokyo. Climbers in Tokyo must have been tired of dealing with big sleeping bags, because they were instantly attracted to the compact size of the bags, because they could fit into the bottoms of their backpacks. Sales were sensational. Although we had only recently established ourselves in 1975, Montbell's reputation suddenly exploded.\nThis new down-like synthetic fiber attracted a great deal of attention, and 2 to 3 years later other fiber manufacturers would follow suit. Within a few years, the Dacron Hollofil II sleeping bag supplanted the traditional sleeping bag for climbers. The mainstream thinking used to be \"big and heavy\", but it was now shifting towards \"lightweight and compact\". I believe that this was the defining moment of change in the history of sleeping bags.\nThe Clo Value : a guide to warmth\nIf you go to an outdoor shop today to buy a sleeping bag, you'll find sleeping bags are advertised with temperature ratings such as, \"You can sleep comfortably with this sleeping bag down to minus X degrees.\" But until about 30 years ago, there were only 3 choices for a sleeping bag: summer, 3-season or winter. This made the standards for selecting a bag extremely vague. Climbers and hikers would ask, \"Is a summer bag appropriate for high altitudes in summer?\" or \"If I'm going to be hiking low altitudes in winter, will I really need a winter bag?\" Decision making came down to your own personal outdoor experiences and intuition.\nThe reason these vague categories became the ratings of today was a result of the \"clo value.\" This value represents insulation as a numerical unit, and is based on data collected by the U.S. Army from 20,000 soldiers who were measured under all sorts of conditions. Because now we were able to understand the insulation level of a sleeping bag in specific numerical values, the standards were no longer vague, and it enabled people to choose the best bag depending on their destination and weather conditions.\nToday, the EN13537 European standard has come into use, which standardizes temperature ratings for each sex based on various environmental conditions. But still, \"warmth\" is subjective and varies from person to person, and is not an absolute value. Although a chart might designate a certain value as appropriate, a person might experience that value as cold or even hot. We should keep in mind that these values should ultimately be used as a \"guideline\" or \"reference point\". According to one theory, the standard temperature which a person feels comfortable has apparently risen 3℃ compared to 30 years ago. It appears that valuation standards of temperature may continue to change with the passage of time.\n- Clo Value\n1 Clo is the equivalent of insulation a person at rest needs to maintain a skin temperature of 33 degrees Celsius in a room with 50% or less humidity, 21 degrees Celsius and wind speed of 5cm/second. For example, at 0 degrees Celsius, 4.5 Clo is necessary to stay comfortable (i.e. comfort rating) and 3.4 Clo is enough to get by (i.e. limit rating). This is how the Clo was used to scientifically study and describe the relationship between warmth and quality of sleep. (ASTM D1518 Standard)\n- EN (European Standard) 13537\nEuropean Standards are standards and specifications for products used throughout the European Union. EN 13537 is the standard that defines how temperature ratings for sleeping bags are calculated. Before this standard it was common for each manufacturer to have their own system for rating sleeping bags.\n- EN135371 Testing Method\nA thermal manikin is dressed in long underwear and placed inside a sleeping bag lying down. A heating element within the manikin is used to heat the manikin to body temperature and sensors record how much power is used to maintain body temperature. These readings are then used to calculate temperature ratings.\n- EN 13537 Temperature Ratings\nComfort Limit: the temperature at which a standard woman can expect to sleep comfortably in a relaxed position.\nLower Limit: the temperature at which a standard man can sleep for eight hours in a curled position without waking.\nExtreme Limit: the minimum temperature at which a standard woman can remain for six hours without risk of death from hypothermia (though frostbite is still possible).\nThe Stretch System: staying warm and a good night's sleep\nEveryone has had the experience of a cold night on a mountain or a hike, and the cold is making it real hard to get to sleep and you might tug at the hem of your sleeping bag, to try to get just a little bit warmer. Just as a mummy bag is warmer than an envelope-style bag, the closer the insulation in a sleeping bag is to the body, the better it retains heat. However, if the bag is too tight, it can be constrictive and conversely deprive one of a good night's sleep. So how is it we can utilize insulation in the most efficient way possible? The hint to that answer lies in all those cold nights spent tugging at the hem of a sleeping bag. This hint lead to the idea of stretchable sleeping bags.\nThe inside of a sleeping bag is constructed to prevent the insulation from gathering to one side, or separating, through divisions created by stitching and non-woven fabrics. In 1988, we added elastic to these stitched areas to create a stretch system. The elasticity would add a relaxed, comfortable experience while providing an appropriately close fit. After acquiring a patent for this idea, we granted licenses to several manufacturers, such as Sierra Designs and Mountain Equipment, and now stretchable properties in sleeping bags are familiar to people throughout the world. Although that original patent has expired, we have continued to innovate and make revisions to the design, such as positioning the stretchable threads diagonally to eliminate tightness and improve fit, so our sleeping bags can provide an even better night’s sleep.\nSome final words and advice on sleeping bags\nEveryone has had the experience of feeling too cold in a sleeping bag and layering clothing to get through the night. If you layer your clothing, naturally it will become tighter and more difficult to sleep, but it's still better than losing sleep because of the cold. During these times, you want to make sure that you don't wear rain gear or other types of clothing which can become stuffy. Although most types of rainwear are breathable to release moisture that builds up inside the rainwear, rainwear does make it more difficult for perspiration to escape from the body, making you feel sticky and sweaty. Instead of layering clothing, back in the day we would fill an aluminum thermos with hot water to use as a hot water bottle, but now there are more convenient products such as disposable heating pads, so you may want to consider packing some of those on your next trip.\nAlso, I think that it can be a good idea to combine 2 sleeping bags together. For example, if you insert a summer bag inside of a 3 season bag, you should be able to use this set up for winter. But in winter alpine conditions, there are some downsides, such as having to open and close 2 sets of zippers, and dealing with the slight increase in weight. I feel that the extra weight isn't that noticeable. I feel this sleep system is not only economical, but also versatile for use throughout the year. I heartily recommend it.\nSleeping pads : a necessary accessory\nThe warmth in a sleeping bag is derived from the loft in the insulation. Conversely, no matter how high the heat retaining properties of the insulating material, without lofting there is no warmth. When sleeping, the insulation in contact with the back (the side placed to the ground) is compressed due to the body's weight, and in especially cold climates the ground acts as a sink to suck warmth from the body. This is why it is necessary to have a sleeping pad to insulate the body from the ground. The pad also has the added benefit of cushioning and helping improve sleeping conditions.\nSleeping pads are largely divided into three types; air pads, which are pumped with air, foam pads, made of a spongy material, and in between these categories, self inflating pads. An air pad has the benefit of being compact and stores easily, but in snowy conditions where the ground is cold, the heat exchange which occurs through air convection can deprive the body of its heat, in which case you should select a foam or self inflating pad. The optimal size for a pad is one that covers the length of your body, but if you want to lighten your load, you can stick your feet in or on top of your backpack, or use your clothes or jacket as a pillow.\nQuestions from readers\nQ: During winter, there's water on the outside of my sleeping bag when I wake up. Is there anything I can do to prevent this?\nDuring winter time, the moisture from your breath condenses due to the difference in temperature, and adheres as frost around the opening of your sleeping bag. And when this fabric comes into contact with your face, you will feel the cold and wet, and it’s uncomfortable. You can minimize this by wrapping a muffler or scarf around your neck and face. However, you can also burrow deep inside your sleeping bag, keeping your mouth and nose away from the opening. By keeping the warm air from your mouth away from the opening, you can mitigate the condensation, and the added benefit of your breathing will help keep you warm inside your sleeping bag.\nQ: My feet are always cold. Do you have any advice?\nIf your sleeping bag is long and has extra space, you can bunch up the bottom of the bag, increasing the density of insulation at your feet, and increasing heat retention. Another alternative is wrapping a sweater or down jacket around your feet. If your socks get wet, don’t try to dry them out by wearing them. Instead, change into dry socks, or warm your feet with your hands. Disposable heating pads are also convenient.\nFumiaki Masaki was born in Osaka Prefecture, 1952. He is the Advising Director of the Board at Montbell. In 1972, he went on an expedition in Europe and climbed the north face of the Grandes Jorasses and was the first Japanese climber to climb the western face of the Aiguille de Dru. In 1975, long time climbing partner and current CEO of Montbell, Isamu Tatsuno asked Masaki to go into business with him and the two formed Montbell. Over the years Masaki would be involved in product research and development, production and sales. His area of expertise is materials, particularly fabric and fibers.","Whether you love to travel to exotic places, like the Arctic, or you just live in an area where the winter weather physically pains you, preparation is key. It’s time to get educated in the world of extreme cold-weather gear.\nThe key to extreme cold weather gear protection – Layers\nThe key to extreme cold weather preparation is layering, but this doesn’t mean just throwing on a couple of hoodies. You need arctic clothing geared towards providing extreme protection and along with utilizing layering.\nThere are three basic types of layers you need to know: the base layer, the mid-layers, and the outer layer. Finally, remember that you’ll need to layer both your upper body and lower body.\nThe Base Layer – Extreme Cold Weather Gear\nThe base layer needs to be tight to your skin in order to minimize airflow. Long underwear is typically the base layer for legs. The most important property of the base layer is water resistance. If your inner layer is cold and wet, it doesn’t matter what else you have on – you’ll freeze. Base layer materials have different weights depending on thickness and breathability. Look for a lightweight rating for\nRelated: Best Winter Coats for Men\nMid Layers – Extreme Cold Weather Gear\nUp next is the mid-layer(s). While it typically consists of a single item, you can wear more than one if needed. Unlike the base layer, the mid-layer doesn’t need to be so tight, some airflow is okay. The most important aspect to look for is insulation. The primary responsibility of a mid-layer is to prevent heat from leaving your body. Look for thick, insulating materials like fleece or wool.\nThe Outer Layer – Extreme Cold Weather Gear\nFinally, the outer shell layer is your first line of defense against the elements. Wind protection is paramount and should be your top concern. Ideally, you want it to be breathable allowing water can escape from inside. At the same time, you don’t want water to enter from the outside. This paradox means there is no perfect outer layer. In general, water resistance is the priority for activities like skiing, but breathability is more important for activities like running.\nDon’t forget your head, hands, and feet\nOne last thing, you have to make sure your extremities are well protected. Once temperatures reach below zero it’s really easy to develop a case for frostbit quickly. Utilizing clothing like arctic boots, arctic gloves and mitts, hats, socks, and balaclavas are all great ideas. Below we’ve assembled the best extreme cold gear there is to prepare you for any winter situation.\nExtreme Cold Weather Gear: The Base Layer\nTCA PRO PERFORMANCE COMPRESSION BASE LAYER TOP LONG SLEEVE THERMAL BODY ARMOUR\nThe TCA Pro Performance Compression Base Layer ($17) is a high performance, but an\nPATAGONIA MERINO 2 LIGHTWEIGHT BOTTOMS\nThe Patagonia Merino 2 Lightweight Bottoms ($90) are the highest quality long johns you can buy.

{"question":"What are the similarities between the poetry selection processes of the Southbank Centre's list and Yehuda Amichai's work in terms of their international and linguistic diversity?","answer":"Both demonstrated strong international representation. The Southbank Centre's list included poets from 30 different countries, including St Lucia and Iraqi Kurdistan, with readings conducted in multiple languages including Arabic and Turkish with English translations. Similarly, Amichai's work showcased linguistic diversity, being translated into 37 different languages and effectively communicating across cultural boundaries, though Robert Alter noted that some of Amichai's Hebrew wordplay and allusive elements were 'untranslatable' and carried special meaning for Hebrew readers.","context":["William Shakespeare and Romantic poets Percy Bysshe Shelley and Lord Byron are among those who have long reigned over the throne of romantic poetry.\nBut while their works are classics, the poetic expression of love, like all else, seems to have evolved over the course of time. To celebrate revitalised, non-formulaic romantic poetry, a new list of the 50 greatest love poems has been compiled poetry specialists at the Southbank Centre, London. And making it to the list is Pakistani poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz’s Before You Came (Tum Jo Naa aa’e The), reported The Guardian.\nFrom unrequited to conquered love, Faiz’s works are glorified the world over, the list being a testament to this. Faiz’s Before You Came is an account of how life was before he met his lover and how with his lover’s advent, “roses burst into flame.” “aur ab shiishaah-e-maii, raahguzar, rang-e-falak/rang hai dil ka mere, ‘khoon-e-jigar hone tak’/champaa’i rang kabhi, raahat-e-deedar ka rang/sur’ma’ii rang kabhi, saa’at-e-bezaar ka rang.” The list focuses on non-traditional works written over the last 50 years. This celebration is part of the Festival of Love and biennial Poetry International festival, initiated by Ted Hughes in 1967. The selected poets come from 30 countries including St Lucia and Iraqi Kurdistan.\nThe poems range from those by American poet Maya Angelou to India’s Vikram Seth. Angelou was chosen for her lyrical plea titled Come, and Be My Baby, in which she writes, “you sit wondering/What you’re gonna do./I got it./Come. And be my baby.” With the verses, “Know that you aren’t alone/The whole world shares your tears,” Seth’s sombre All You Who Sleep Tonight, is also part of the list. A few well-known British poets such as the late Adrian Mitchell with his poem Celia, Celia, have also made it to the list.\nThe poetry team at the Southbank Centre had been working on the list for the last year, utilising the expertise of its Saison Poetry Library. Head of literature and spoken word James Runcie has described the list as “a truly international and stylistically diverse selection of what we see as the best 50 love poems of the past 50 years – from young poets such as the first Young Poet Laureate for London, Warsan Shire, to world greats such as Chinua Achebe.” He added, “It was tough restricting ourselves to just 50 poems, but I think we’ve come up with a wonderfully rich and varied offering of some of the world’s greatest love poems.”\nThe poems will be recited on July 20 at what is being described as an “unprecedented event” by the Southbank Centre. 50 individuals, ranging from actors to poets, will come together to read out one poem each. Interestingly, Celia Hewitt, who is the subject of Mitchell’s Celia, Celia, will recite the poem she inspired. The readings will take place in Arabic, Turkish, among other languages, with English translations.\n10 Of The Poems That Have Made It To The List Of 50 Greatest Love Poems:\nMichael Donaghy (USA) — The Present\nPhilippe Jaccottet (France) — Distances\nFaiz Ahmed Faiz (Pakistan) — Before You Came\nMutsuo Takahashi (Japan) — Dove\nLawrence Bradby (England) — If Your Faith in Me Should Fail\nAnat Zecharaya (Israel) — A Woman of Valour (Trans Hebrew)\nNina Cassian (Romania) — Lady of Miracles\nAnnabelle Despard (Norway) — Should You Die First\nSinead Morrissey (Ireland) — Forgive Us Our Trespasses\nNaomi Shibab Nye (Palestine) — Shoulders\nPublished in The Express Tribune, July 5th, 2014.","Yehuda Amichai is recognized as one of Israel’s finest poets. His poems—written in Hebrew—have been translated into forty languages, and entire volumes of his work have been published in English, French, German, Swedish, Spanish, and Catalan. Translator Robert Alter has said: “Yehuda Amichai, it has been remarked with some justice, is the most widely translated Hebrew poet since King David.” Amichai’s translations into English have been particularly popular, and his imaginative and accessible style has opened up Hebrew poetry to American and English readers in a whole new way. The poet C. K. Williams described Amichai as \"the shrewdest and most solid of poetic intelligences.\" Amichai’s numerous books of poetry include his first in Hebrew, Now and In Other Days (1955), which announced his distinctively colloquial voice, and two breakthrough volumes that introduced him to American readers: Poems (1969) and Selected Poems of Yehuda Amichai (1971), both co-translated by Ted Hughes, who became a good friend and advocate of Amichai’s work. Later works translated into English include Time: Travels of a Latter-Day Benjamin of Tudela (1976), Yehuda Amichai: A Life in Poetry 1948-1994 (1994), The Selected Poetry of Yehuda Amichai (1996), Exile at Home (1998), and Open Closed Open (2000). Amichai also published two novels, including his first work to be translated into English, Not of This Time, Not of This Place (1968), and a book of short stories.\nBorn in Germany in 1924, Amichai left that country at age twelve with his family and journeyed to Palestine. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli war he fought with the Israeli defense forces. The rigors and horrors of his service in this conflict, and in World War II, inform his poetry, although he is never ideological. In an interview with the Paris Review, Amichai noted that all poetry was political: “This is because real poems deal with a human response to reality, and politics is part of reality, history in the making,” he said. “Even if a poet writes about sitting in a glass house drinking tea, it reflects politics.” It was during the war that Amichai began to be interested in poetry, reading modern English and American poetry, by authors such as Dylan Thomas, W.H. Auden, and T.S. Eliot. According to Alter, Amichai’s early work bears a resemblance to the poetry of Thomas and Auden. \"[Rainer Maria] Rilke,\" wrote Alter, \"is another informing presence for him, occasionally in matters of style—he has written vaguely Rilkesque elegies—but perhaps more as a model for using a language of here and now as an instrument to catch the glimmerings of a metaphysical beyond.\" Although Amichai’s native language was German, he read Hebrew fluently by the time he immigrated to Palestine.\nAfter the war, Amichai attended Hebrew University. He taught in secondary schools, teachers’ seminars, Hebrew University, and later at American institutions such as New York University, University of California-Berkeley, and Yale. In a New York Times Magazine profile of Amichai, Alter noted that by the mid-1960s Amichai was \"already regarded in many circles in Israel as the country’s leading poet.\" Amichai’s reputation outside of Israel soon soared. Alter explained that Amichai was \"accorded international recognition unprecedented for a modern Hebrew poet.\" In Israel, his books were frequently bestsellers, and in 1982, Amichai received the prestigious Israel Prize for Poetry for effecting “a revolutionary change in poetry’s language.” Among his many other honors and awards, he was nominated for the Noble Prize.\nWhile he became known as an “accessible” poet whose work translated seamlessly into many languages, Alter has taken pains to describe Amichai’s style as something much more complex in its native Hebrew. Amichai frequently exploits Hebrew’s levels of diction, Alter noted in an article for Modern Hebrew Literature, which are generally based on historical usage of words, rather than class. Alter continues: “Amichai’s exploitation of indigenous stylistic resources is often connected with his sensitivity to the expressive sounds of the Hebrew words he uses and with his inventive puns, which are sometimes playful, sometimes dead serious, and often both at once. But what is most untranslatable are the extraordinary allusive twists he gives to densely specific Hebrew terms and texts.” Despite the echoes of other poets and traditions in his work, Alter stressed it was important to remember “that Amichai is not simply an Auden or a William Carlos Williams writing from right to left, that he uses his own language and literary tradition as a delicately tuned instrument that communicates to Hebrew readers certain tonalities that others will not hear.” Yet Amichai’s entire body of work speaks persuasively to his powers as an everyman, both of his people and the world. Reviewing The Selected Poetry of Yehuda Amichai, American poet Ed Hirsch stated that Amichai “is a representative man with unusual gifts who in telling his own story also relates the larger story of his people.”\nAmichai’s papers and archive is housed at the Beinecke Library at Yale University.

{"question":"As someone concerned about safety when making homemade soap, I'd like to know: What are the key safety considerations when working with lye in both cold and hot process soap making, and how do the handling procedures differ between these two methods? Could you explain the proper protective measures and precautions needed for each?","answer":"In both cold and hot process soap making, lye safety is crucial. Lye is caustic and can cause burns or irritation upon contact with skin or eyes. Essential safety measures include: wearing protective gear (gloves, goggles, long sleeves, and closed-toe shoes), working in a well-ventilated area, avoiding breathing lye fumes, and keeping vinegar nearby to neutralize spills. When handling lye, it must always be poured into water (not the other way around) to prevent dangerous chemical reactions. For hot process specifically, additional care must be taken as the mixture is heated - the soap mixture becomes very hot during cooking and requires careful monitoring. In both methods, accurate measurements are crucial for safety, and following trusted recipes is essential.","context":["If you’ve ever wondered what “cold process soap” means, you’re in the right place. In this article, we’ll demystify this popular, natural soap making method by exploring its ingredients, process, benefits, and how it compares to hot process soap. So, what does cold process soap mean?\nCold process means the soap is made without external heat. That is where the “cold process” part of the name comes from. The soap is made by mixing oils, lye solution, and optional additives without external heat. It hardens and matures over several weeks as it cures.\nAs interest in natural and sustainable products grows, cold process soap has gained popularity among both consumers and DIY enthusiasts. Its simple ingredients and creative possibilities make it an appealing choice for those who seek a personalized, skin-friendly soap.\nMoreover, making cold process soap at home can be a fulfilling hobby, allowing you to craft unique, eco-conscious gifts for friends and family or to simply indulge yourself in a luxurious, handcrafted bathing experience.\nLet’s take a closer look at the cold process soap making method.\nBetter Understanding Cold Process Soap\nOils and fats form the foundation of cold process soap. Popular choices include olive oil for a mild, gentle lather; coconut oil for a bubbly, cleansing effect; and sustainably-sourced palm oil for a firm bar. Additionally, luxurious shea and cocoa butters impart moisturizing properties.\nLye, also known as sodium hydroxide, is a potent alkali that reacts with oils through saponification, transforming them into soap. Lye solution is prepared by carefully dissolving lye in water or alternative liquids like milk or tea.\nA variety of additives enhance the soap’s appearance, fragrance, and skincare benefits. Essential oils like lavender and eucalyptus provide natural scents, while herbs, such as calendula and chamomile, contribute gentle exfoliation or soothing effects.\nClays like kaolin or bentonite can detoxify and improve skin texture. Coloring agents stem from natural sources like micas and plant-based powders or soap-specific dyes for creative designs.\nCold Process Soap Making Steps\nPreparing the ingredients\nBefore starting, gather all necessary ingredients, tools, and protective gear. Measure oils, fats, and lye solution accurately using a digital scale.\nMelt solid oils and butters gently until liquid, then let them cool to room temperature. Prepare the lye solution in a well-ventilated area, allowing it to cool as well.\nMixing oils and lye\nOnce cooled, slowly pour the lye solution into the oils while stirring gently. Use an immersion blender to blend the mixture until it reaches a pudding-like consistency, known as “trace.” Add essential oils, additives, and colors at this stage, blending them thoroughly.\nTracing and molding\nWhen the soap reaches trace, it’s time to pour it into a mold. Use a silicone or lined wooden mold to facilitate easy removal.\nGently tap the mold on the counter to release air bubbles, then use a spatula to create a smooth or textured top, as desired.\nCover the filled mold with a towel or insulation to maintain a consistent temperature. Let the soap sit undisturbed for 24-48 hours, then carefully remove it from the mold.\nCut it into bars and place them on a rack or tray, allowing air circulation. Allow the soap to cure for 4-6 weeks to ensure hardness, mildness, and a longer-lasting bar.\nBenefits of Cold Process Soap\nNatural and gentle\nCold process soap is made with natural ingredients, free from harsh chemicals or synthetic detergents. Its gentle, moisturizing properties suit all skin types, including sensitive skin.\nMaking cold process soap offers endless creative possibilities. Choose oils, scents, colors, and additives to create a unique, personalized soap tailored to your preferences or skincare needs.\nCold process soaps generally last longer than commercial alternatives, as they are denser and more concentrated. The curing process allows excess water to evaporate, resulting in a firm, high-quality soap bar.\nCold Process vs. Hot Process Soap\nCold process soap making involves mixing oils and lye solution without heat, while hot process soap requires cooking the mixture to speed up saponification. The two methods result in distinct final products.\nCold process soap tends to have a smoother, more polished appearance, making it ideal for intricate designs and patterns. Hot process soap, due to cooking, has a rustic, rough texture that resembles thick porridge or mashed potatoes.\nCold process soap requires a longer curing time, typically 4-6 weeks, to achieve its optimal qualities. Hot process soap, however, is ready to use immediately after cooling and hardening, as the cooking process eliminates excess water and completes saponification.\nCold Process vs Melt and Pour\nCold process soap and melt and pour soap are two popular methods of soap making that cater to different preferences, skill levels, and creative possibilities.\nCold process soap is made from scratch, using oils, fats, and lye solution. The ingredients are mixed at specific temperatures, traced, molded, and cured over 4-6 weeks.\nThis method requires more expertise, patience, and safety precautions, but it allows for greater customization and control over the ingredients, making it ideal for those seeking a natural and artisanal product.\nCold process soap is known for its gentle, moisturizing properties, and offers endless creative opportunities for colors, scents, and additives.\nMelt and pour soap, on the other hand, involves melting a pre-made soap base, which can be easily customized with colors, fragrances, and additives before pouring into molds.\nThis method is beginner-friendly, as it doesn’t require handling lye or the extensive curing period associated with cold process soap.\nMelt and pour soap making allows for quick, fun, and creative projects, but it often lacks the same level of customization and natural appeal as cold process soap.\nThe choice between cold process and melt and pour soap depends on your skill level, desired level of customization, and the time you’re willing to invest in the soap making process. Both methods offer unique advantages and opportunities for creating personalized, handcrafted soaps.\nCold Process Soap Making Tips\nHere are some tips to guide you through the cold process soap making process.\n- Research the process, safety guidelines, and gather all necessary tools and ingredients.\n- Use a digital scale for accurate measurements.\n- Control the temperature of oils and lye solution during mixing.\n- Be patient and wait for the mixture to reach trace.\n- Test new fragrances and colors in small batches.\n- Experiment with different additives for unique soap properties.\n- Ensure a low-humidity, well-ventilated environment during the curing process.\n- Rotate soap batches for even drying and air circulation.\n- Maintain detailed records of your soap making process.\n- Connect with fellow soap makers for inspiration and support.\nYou can expect to improve your cold process soap making skills by following these tips, leading to the creation of beautiful, high-quality, and unique soap bars. As you gain experience, you’ll be able to craft soaps tailored to your preferences and skincare needs.\nSafety Tips for Cold Process Soap Making\nLye is caustic and can cause burns or irritation upon contact with skin or eyes. When handling lye, always pour it into water or other liquids, not the other way around, to prevent dangerous chemical reactions. Work in a well-ventilated area and avoid breathing in lye fumes.\nTo protect yourself from lye exposure, wear appropriate safety gear, such as gloves, goggles, long sleeves, and closed-toe shoes. Keep a bottle of vinegar nearby to neutralize any lye spills or skin contact.\nAlways follow trusted soap recipes and instructions, particularly regarding lye amounts and proper ratios. Accurate measurements are crucial for a safe and successful soap making experience. Research and understand each ingredient’s properties and characteristics before experimenting with new formulations.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMaking cold process soap takes a few hours, including preparation, mixing, and molding. However, the curing period requires an additional 4-6 weeks before the soap is ready for use.\nNo, lye is a necessary ingredient for making cold process soap, as it reacts with oils through saponification to produce soap. Without lye, the process would not occur.\nYes, cold process soap is generally safe for sensitive skin, as it contains natural ingredients and lacks harsh chemicals or synthetic detergents found in some commercial soaps.\nYes, natural colorants such as plant-based powders, clays, or micas can be used to add color to cold process soap.\nSilicone or lined wooden molds work well for cold process soap, as they facilitate easy removal of the soap after it has hardened.\nFollow safety precautions like wearing protective gear, handling lye properly, working in a well-ventilated area, and following trusted recipes and instructions to ensure a safe soap making experience.\nIn conclusion, cold process soap offers a natural, gentle, and customizable alternative to conventional soaps. By understanding the ingredients, process, and benefits of this artisanal soap, you can make informed decisions when purchasing or crafting your own soap.\nThe cold process method provides endless creative opportunities and a high-quality, long-lasting product, making it a favorite among soap enthusiasts. As you venture into the world of cold process soap making, remember to follow safety precautions and enjoy the rewarding experience.","by Bill Barnhill\nItems Needed: (Makes enough for two bread pans)\nLg.

Add lavender buds and coloring. Put the lid back on and let it cook for another 15 minutes.\nStep 11: At the end of the 15 minutes give it another good stir – and at this point you will want to test for lye. I usually take a bit of the mix (watch out it’s very hot) and roll it between my gloved fingers, wait for it to cool, then touch to the tongue. If it zaps your tongue let it cook for another 20 minutes and re-test. If you are leery about touching your tongue with the mix, then just take a small piece of soap and soap up your hands under running water – if it stings, then you still have lye and need to cook for another 20 minutes before rechecking.\nStep 12: At this point you will have to work quickly because hot process soap can get very hard to pour if left to cool for very long.\nNote: To save time, you can add the fragrance oils to the fats/oil mixture before adding the lye/water mixture – this will keep the soap mixture more pliable for pouring into molds.\nStep 13: After you pour the soap into the lined mold, pound the mold a couple of times on the counter and then cover soap with Saran Wrap. Smooth out the top of the soap in the soap mold by using your gloves hands.\nLet the soap sit in the molds to cool for 24 hours. Take out and cut into bars.\nI always let my hot processed soap bars sit in a well ventilated room for them to have a good drying out for at least 3 to 4 days before I package them.\nStep 14: This is how I set up my space for my cold and hot process soaps to cure. I took the brown shelves out and installed these wire shelves I purchased at Lowe’s. This is an old, large bookshelf that I have had for years, and it worked great. I don’t have to turn my soaps.\nGood luck, and happy soaping!\nBill Barnhill, Wild Rose Organics"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:095ed315-93a9-489c-80af-b6052a8bedc8>","<urn:uuid:1d59a4ca-8bfd-4751-be06-49e9c80a37e6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As Christian leader, what is Church stance on respecting other faiths while maintaining biblical values?","answer":"The Church emphasizes both maintaining biblical values and showing respect for other faiths. The fundamental beliefs state that Christians should love their neighbors and enemies, as commanded by Jesus Christ. This includes showing respect to people of all faiths, avoiding hatred, and being ambassadors of reconciliation. The Church recognizes the need to protect all people who face persecution and hatred, regardless of their religion, including both Christians and Muslims. Christians are called to be peacemakers and witnesses of reconciliation through both word and deed, working toward a vision where all can flourish without harm to anyone else.","context":["Church of God, a Worldwide Association Fundamental Beliefs\nThe following statements represent the fundamental beliefs of the Church of God, a Worldwide Association. These beliefs, based upon Holy Scripture, do not constitute the entire body of beliefs of the Church but do represent its fundamental or foundational beliefs.\n1. The Godhead\nGod the Father is an eternally existing Spirit, a perfect, personal Being of supreme love, intelligence, knowledge, justice, power and authority. It was through the Word (who became Jesus Christ) that He created all things that exist. The Father is the Source of life, the Sustainer of the universe through His power. There is one Lord, Jesus Christ, who has eternally existed. He came to earth to do the will of the Father. He is the Messiah, the Christ and the divine Son of the living God, who was born of human flesh to the virgin Mary. God is an eternal family currently consisting of the Father and the Son. Both the Father and Son are involved in the creative work of expanding this family by bringing many children (sons and daughters) to glory. The Holy Spirit is the power of God and the Spirit of life eternal, not a separate entity or being.\nScriptural support: Ephesians 4:6; 1 Corinthians 8:6; John 1:1-4; Colossians 1:16; Ephesians 3:15; 2 Timothy 1:7; Hebrews 2:10; 2 Corinthians 6:18.\n2. The Angelic Realm and Satan\nThe angelic realm, consisting of various types of spirit beings, was created by God. A former “covering cherub,” Lucifer, rebelled against God’s authority and became Satan the devil. As Lucifer, he influenced one-third of the angels to follow him. Those who followed him are now evil spirits known as demons. Satan the devil is the adversary of both God and mankind. He and his demons influence mankind to reject God and His law. These evil spirits have been allowed temporary dominion over the earth and have deceived the majority of human beings. The angels who remained faithful to God serve as ministering spirits to those responding to God’s calling.\nScriptural support: Matthew 4:1-11; Luke 8:12; 2 Timothy 2:26; John 12:31; 16:11; Revelation 12:4, 9; 20:1-3, 7, 10; Leviticus 16:21-22; 2 Corinthians 4:4; 11:14; Ephesians 2:2; Hebrews 1:14.\nHuman beings, both male and female, were created in the image of God with the potential to partake of God’s divine nature as children in His eternal family. Humans are mortal beings relying on the breath of life and are subject to corruption and decay. They do not have an immortal soul nor do they possess eternal life at this time. Eternal life is a gift of God, given only to those who accept His calling and the terms and conditions expressed in the Scriptures. God gave Adam and Eve the choice of eternal life through obedience to Him or death through sin. Adam and Eve succumbed to sin by disobeying God. As a result, death entered the world. All humans have sinned and are therefore subject to death. In God’s plan it is appointed for man to “die once.”\nScriptural support: Genesis 1:26; 2 Peter 1:4; Hebrews 9:27; 1 Corinthians 15:22; Romans 3:23; 5:12; 6:23; 8:16-17.\n4. The Purpose of Human Life\nGod’s purpose for human beings is to add them as children to His eternal family. While it is clear that eternal life is a gift from God, He expects His children to respond to His calling, develop righteous character by overcoming sin, and grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ. When Christ returns to this earth, these faithful humans will be born as spirit beings into the family of God and will reign on earth as kings and priests with Christ.\nScriptural support: John 1:12; Romans 6:15-16; 8:14-17, 30; Acts 2:39; 1 Corinthians 15:50-53; 2 Peter 3:18; Revelation 1:6; 3:5; 5:10.\n5. The Word of God\nScripture, both the Old and the New Testaments of the Holy Bible, is the Word of God and contains God’s complete revelation of His will and plan for humanity. Directly inspired by God in thought and word, it is perfect and infallible as originally written. Scripture is the supreme and final authority for faith and life. It is the source for doctrine and the foundation for all truth.\nScriptural support: 2 Timothy 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21; John 10:35; 17:17.\n6. Sin and God’s Law\nSin is the transgression of the law of God, which is spiritual, perfect, holy, just and good. God’s law is based upon the two great principles of love toward God and love toward neighbor. The Ten Commandments expound these foundational principles of God’s law of love. Breaking any part of God’s law brings upon a person the penalty of death. Those who love God and seek eternal life will strive to keep God’s commandments. Obedience to God’s law produces happiness and peace of mind. Disobedience to God’s law produces misery and strife and ultimately eternal death.\nScriptural support: 1 John 3:4; 5:3; Matthew 5:17-19; 19:17-19; 22:37-40; James 2:10-11; Romans 2:5-9; 6:23; 7:12-14; 13:8-10.\n7. The Sacrifice of Jesus Christ\nGod so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son so humans may have eternal life. In God’s perfect righteousness, the penalty for our sins must be paid in full. After living a human life without sin, even though tempted in all points as we are, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died as the perfect sacrifice for all the sins of humanity. As God in the flesh and the Creator of all humanity, His death makes it possible for each person and humanity as a whole to be forgiven of their sins, released from the death penalty that comes upon all because of sin and reconciled to God the Father. This plan of salvation for mankind existed from the foundation of the world.\nScriptural support: John 1:18; 3:16; Ephesians 1:11; Colossians 1:16-17, 22; Hebrews 4:15; 9:15; 10:12; 1 John 2:2; 4:10; Revelation 5:9; 13:8.\n8. Three Days and Three Nights\nJesus Christ was raised from the dead by the Father after His body lay for three days and three nights in the grave. The length of time that He was in the grave was the only sign He gave to prove He was the Messiah. The resurrection of Jesus Christ made immortality possible for mortal human beings. After His resurrection, Christ ascended into heaven, where He now sits at the right hand of God the Father as our High Priest, elder Brother and Advocate with the Father.\nScriptural support: 1 Peter 1:17-21; 3:22; Matthew 12:39-40; 1 Corinthians 15:53; 2 Timothy 1:10; John 20:17; Hebrews 2:10-15; 8:1; 12:2; 1 John 2:1.\nRepentance is a gift from God—a gift that is necessary for salvation and a proper relationship with God. All who wish to be pardoned from the death penalty that comes through sin must genuinely repent of their sins, fully surrender their lives to God and obey His commandments. They must by faith accept Jesus Christ as their personal Savior, their Lord and Master, their High Priest and their soon coming King. These individuals are justified, forgiven of their sins as an act of divine grace, being baptized and receiving the Holy Spirit with the laying on of hands. At baptism they become part of the spiritual Body of Christ, the true Church of God.\nScriptural support: Acts 2:38; 3:19; 5:29-32; 2 Corinthians 7:10; John 3:16; Ephesians 1:7; 2:7-10; Romans 3:21-26; 5:5; 6:6; 8:4, 9-10, 14; 13:10; Jeremiah 33:8; John 14:16-17; 1 Corinthians 12:12-13; Philippians 2:3-5; 2 Timothy 2:25.\n10. Water Baptism\nWater baptism by immersion after repentance pictures the forgiveness of sin, the burial of the old man and the beginning of a new life in Christ. Through prayer and the laying on of hands following baptism, repentant believers receive the gift of the Holy Spirit and become part of the spiritual Body of Jesus Christ. By yielding to and being led by the Holy Spirit, those who have repented and been baptized experience a true change in life, attitude and way of thinking.\nScriptural support: John 3:23; Acts 2:38; 8:14-17; 19:5-6; Ephesians 4:22-24; 1 Corinthians 12:13.\n11. The Seventh-Day Sabbath\nThe seventh day of the week is the Sabbath of the Lord our God, and on this day humans are commanded to rest from their labors and worship Him. Established and blessed by God at creation, the seventh day of the week begins at sunset on Friday and continues until sunset on Saturday. The Sabbath is an identifying sign and a perpetual covenant between God and His people. True Christians follow the example of Jesus Christ, the apostles and the New Testament Church in observing the seventh-day Sabbath.\nScriptural support: Genesis 2:2-3; Exodus 20:8-11; 31:13-17; Leviticus 23:3; Isaiah 58:13; Hebrews 4:4-10; Mark 1:21; 2:27-28; 6:2; Acts 13:42-44; 17:2; 18:4; Luke 4:31; 1 John 2:4-6.\n12. The Passover\nThe Passover is to be observed in the evening, at the beginning of the 14th of Nisan (Abib) in accordance with the Hebrew calendar as preserved by the Jews. The New Covenant Passover symbols instituted by Jesus Christ on the night before He died—foot-washing, unleavened bread and wine—are part of this service. Christians follow Jesus Christ’s instruction and example by observing the Passover annually as a memorial of His death.\nScriptural support: Exodus 12; Matthew 26:18-30; John 13:1-15; Luke 22:1-20; John 1:29; 1 Corinthians 5:7.\n13. The Festivals of God\nThe seven annual festivals are special times of assembly. Given to ancient Israel by God through Moses and kept by Christ, the apostles and the New Testament Church, they are commanded to be observed today. These festivals reveal God’s plan of salvation for mankind. They will continue to be observed during the Millennium.\nScriptural support: Colossians 2:16-17; 1 Peter 1:19-20; 1 Corinthians 5:8; 15:22-26; 16:8; James 1:18; Exodus 23:14-17; Leviticus 23; Luke 2:41-42; 22:14-15; John 7:2, 8, 10, 14; Acts 2:1; 18:21; 20:16; Zechariah 14:16-19.\n14. Biblical Food Laws\nMeat identified as “unclean” in the Bible is not to be consumed by humans. Lists of “clean” and “unclean” meats are found in God’s instructions concerning what should and should not be eaten.\nScriptural support: Leviticus 11; Deuteronomy 14.\nTithing is commanded by God. Through tithing, one honors God with his material goods and assists in preaching the gospel, providing for the physical needs of the Church and caring for needy members. A special festival tithe makes it possible for one to attend the commanded festivals of God.\nScriptural support: Proverbs 3:9-10; Genesis 14:17-20; Numbers 18:21; Malachi 3:8; 1 Corinthians 9:7-14; Deuteronomy 14:22-29.\n16. Military Service and War\nBecause of Jesus’ teaching that we are to love our enemies and the instruction of God to respect human life, Christians should not serve in the military. The biblical teaching is that if anyone even hates his brother, he is a murderer. Being in the military would create problems keeping the Sabbath and holy days. Because Christians are to obey God rather than men, they need to maintain jurisdiction over their lives. Christians must be careful not to let human issues and concerns distract them from their role as ambassadors in God’s coming Kingdom. Christ declared that His Kingdom was not of this world; therefore His servants would not fight.\nScriptural support: Genesis 9:6; Exodus 20:13; Matthew 5:21-22; Luke 6:27-35; John 18:36; 1 Corinthians 7:21-23; Acts 5:29; 1 John 3:15; 2 Corinthians 5:20.\n17. The Church of God\nThe Church of God is a spiritual body composed of believers who have and are being led by the Holy Spirit. The Church is not a denomination, a human organization or a building but the people God is working with in any age. The biblical name of this church is the “Church of God.” Its mission is to preach the gospel of the coming Kingdom of God to all nations and to make disciples of all who respond to God’s calling, assisting them in their spiritual development and reconciliation to God.\nScriptural support: Acts 2:38-39, 47; 20:28; Romans 8:14; 14:19; Ephesians 1:22-23; 4:11-16; 1 Corinthians 1:2; 10:32; 11:16, 22; 12:27; 15:9; 2 Corinthians 1:1; 5:18-20; Galatians 1:13; 1 Thessalonians 2:14; 2 Thessalonians 1:4; 1 Timothy 3:5; Mark 16:15; Matthew 24:14; 28:18-20; John 6:44, 65; 17:11.\n18. Promises to Abraham\nGod’s fulfillment of His promises to Abraham, a man called the father of the faithful, represents God’s enduring faithfulness and provides important keys to understanding biblical prophecy. As promised, God multiplied Abraham’s descendants so that Abraham literally became the father of many nations. God materially prospered his descendants: Isaac, Jacob (also called Israel) and Jacob’s 12 sons who were the progenitors of the 12 tribes of ancient Israel. Descendants of these peoples continue as prominent nations today (particularly the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh) because they have inherited the physical blessings of Abraham. In addition to the physical blessings promised Abraham, another promise was made by God to this patriarch—a promise of salvation through his Seed (Jesus Christ), which all people, regardless of their physical lineage, may receive. All who respond to God’s calling belong to Christ and are considered Abraham’s seed. Understanding these promises made to Abraham provides a more accurate understanding of the world today and the messages of the prophets.\nScriptural support: Genesis 12:1-3; 32:28; Psalm 111:1-10; Romans 4:12, 16; 9:7-8; Galatians 3:16, 28-29.\n19. The Return of Jesus Christ to Earth\nAt the end of this present evil age, Jesus Christ will visibly return to earth to establish the Kingdom of God and reign forever and ever, beginning with a 1,000-year period commonly called the Millennium. He will sit upon the throne of David, ruling all nations as King of Kings and serving as High Priest to all who recognize Him as their Lord and Master. As prophesied, He will at this time restore all things and establish the Kingdom of God forever.\nScriptural support: Daniel 2:44; 7:14, 18, 27; Matthew 24:30, 44; Revelation 1:7; 11:15; 19:16; 20:4-6; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-16; John 14:3; Isaiah 9:7; 40:10-11; Hebrews 7:24; Jeremiah 23:5; Luke 1:32-33; Acts 1:11; 3:21; 15:16.\n20. The Resurrections\nBeing resurrected from the grave is the only hope of eternal life for deceased human beings. The Scriptures reveal that there will be three distinct future resurrection periods for those who have died. At the return of Jesus Christ, a first resurrection to eternal life will take place for all of God’s faithful servants who have died throughout the ages. These individuals will rise from their graves and, along with living humans who have the Holy Spirit residing within them, will be changed into immortal, spirit beings. After the 1,000-year reign of Jesus Christ on the earth, there will be a second resurrection to physical life for the majority of all people who have ever lived. These people will then have their first and only opportunity to hear, understand and respond to God’s calling. If they become converted, they will receive eternal life. There will be a third resurrection for the incorrigible to a brief period of consciousness, in which they will receive the righteous judgment of God—their destruction in the lake of fire. This resurrection is reserved for those who have rejected God’s offer of salvation, reaping eternal death, also called the second death, from which there is no further resurrection.\nScriptural support: 1 Corinthians 15:19, 45-53; Acts 23:6; John 5:21-29; Romans 6:23; 8:10-11; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17; Ezekiel 37:1-14; Revelation 20:4-5, 11-15; John 3:16; Matthew 25:46.\n© 2014 Church of God, a Worldwide Association, Inc.\nClick here to download a pdf copy.","Biblical Justice, General Worship\nWorship Resources for Peace in a Time of Fear\nDecember 15, 2015\nUpdated February 28, 2018\n0 comments 202 views Posted by Office of Social Justice\nIn response to the San Bernardino shooting and increasingly hostile anti-Arab and anti-Muslim rhetoric, the Office of Race Relations and Office of Social Justice have collaborated on this litany and prayer.

{"question":"How do professional assessment tools evaluate precision skills, both in early childhood development and aircraft maintenance careers?","answer":"In early childhood development, the PDMS-2 evaluates precision skills through specific subtests like Grasping, which measures a child's ability to use their hands from basic holding to controlled use of fingers, and Visual-Motor Integration, which assesses complex eye-hand coordination tasks. In aircraft maintenance, precision skills are evaluated through professional licensing requirements and specialized training, where maintenance engineers must demonstrate meticulous attention to detail in inspecting aircraft components, troubleshooting problems, and maintaining accurate documentation. Both fields require detailed documentation of performance, with PDMS-2 using profile sheets to show mastered tasks and relative strengths/weaknesses, while aircraft maintenance requires careful documentation of pre-flight inspections and maintenance procedures.","context":["Peabody Developmental Motor Scales - 2nd Edition (PDMS-2)\nAuthors: M. Rhonda Folio, EdD / Rebecca R. Fewell, PhD\nThe PDMS-2 Complete Kit is an in-depth assessment of a child's motor development. The six subtests (Reflexes, Stationary, Locomotion, Object Manipulation, Grasping, Visual-Motor Integration) yield two composite scores (Gross Motor and Fine Motor) and an overall score (Total Motor Quotient). All activities are age-appropriate and reflect the expected maturation of the motor system during early development. It is intended to be used by occupational therapists, physical therapists, psychologists, early intervention specialists, and other professionals interested in the early motor development of young children.\nThe Complete Kit contains the Peabody Motor Activities Program (PMAP) which is the instruction and treatment program for the PDMS-2. After a child's motor skills have been assessed and the examiner has completed all sections of the Profile-Summary Form, the examiner selects units from the PMAP to use to facilitate the child's development in specific skills areas.\n- Reflexes: This 8-item subtest measures a child's ability to automatically react to environmental events. Because reflexes typically become integrated by the time a child is 12 months old, this subtest is only given to children birth through 11 months.\n- Stationary: This 30-item subtest measures a child's ability to sustain control of his or her body within its center of gravity and retain equilibrium.\n- Locomotion: This 89-item subtest measures a child's ability to move from one place to another. The actions measured include crawling, walking, running, hopping, and jumping forward.\n- Object Manipulation: This 24-item subtest measures a child's ability to manipulate balls. Examples of the actions measured include catching, throwing, and kicking. Because these skills are not apparent until a child has reached the age of 11 months, this subtest is only given to children ages 12 months and older.\n- Grasping: This 26-item subtest measures a child's ability to use his or her hands. It begins with the ability to hold an object with one hand and progresses up to actions involving the controlled use of the fingers of both hands.\n- Visual-Motor Integration: This 72-item subtest measures a child's ability to use his or her visual perceptual skills to perform complex eye-hand coordination tasks such as reaching and grasping for an object, building with blocks, and copying designs.\n- Fine Motor Quotient: This composite is a combination of the results of the subtests that measure the use of the small muscle systems: Grasping (all ages), Visual-Motor Integration (all ages).\n- Gross Motor Quotient: This composite is a combination of the results of the subtests that measure the use of the large muscle systems:\nReflexes (birth-11 months only)\nStationary (all ages)\nLocomotion (all ages)\nObject Manipulation (12 months and older)\n- Total Motor Quotient: This composite is formed by a combination of the results of the gross and fine motor subtests. Because of this, it is the best estimate of overall motor abilities.\nAdministration and Scoring\nThe PDMS-2 is individually administered and can be completed in 45 - 60 minutes. Profile sheets allow the examiner to show which tasks the child has mastered and their relative strengths/weaknesses. Scores are reported as standard scores, percentile ranks, and age equivalents.","Have you ever sat in an airport and wondered why planes never seem to take a break from flying? Well, that’s because there are people working behind the scenes to make sure the planes are in tip-top condition all year round!\nBut who are these people exactly? We’re talking about aircraft maintenance engineers and technicians who are trained to fix and maintain planes, which are crucial to the safety of the passengers on-board.\nIf you’ve always been intrigued with planes and the way they work, this guide will explore everything you need to know about studying an aircraft maintenance course in Malaysia!\n#1. The Basics of Aircraft Maintenance\nAircraft maintenance relates to the inspection, repair, modification, replacement and overhaul of aircraft equipment to ensure that an aircraft is in optimal condition and most importantly, safe for flying.\nAircrafts, such as aeroplanes and helicopters, are often subject to undergo routine maintenance after a certain number of flight hours or flight cycles. During this time, aircraft maintenance engineers and technicians perform inspections to ensure the quality and airworthiness of aircrafts. Some of the tasks include replacing worn or damaged components, testing engine operation to detect malfunctions and inspecting engine parts such as turbine blades and cylinders for wear, warping and leaks.\nAs part of your studies in aircraft maintenance, you will equip yourself with the knowledge and skills to inspect aircraft components and systems, diagnose aircraft-related problems and rectify these issues accordingly. You will also gain an understanding of the legal requirements relating to the operation of commercial aircrafts.\n#2. Studying Aircraft Maintenance\na) Entry Requirements and Qualifications\nThere are several ways to obtain an aircraft maintenance qualification after SPM.\n(i) Diploma in Aircraft Maintenance\nIf you are planning to pursue a Diploma in Aircraft Maintenance, these are the general entry requirements that you are required to meet:\n- SPM/O-Level: Minimum 3 credits including Mathematics, and a pass in English\nSome institutions may also require you to have a credit in a Science subject.\nA Diploma in Aircraft Maintenance typically takes about 2.5 years to 3 years to complete, providing you the foundation you need to take an aircraft maintenance licence later on.\n(ii) Degree in Aircraft Maintenance\nIn order to pursue a Degree in Aircraft Maintenance, you will generally need:\n- STPM: Minimum of 3C’s including Mathematics & 1 science subject\n- Diploma: Minimum CGPA of 2.50\n- Foundation in Science: Minimum CGPA of 2.00\nA Degree in Aircraft Maintenance typically takes about 3 to 4 years to complete.\nb) Professional Aircraft Maintenance Qualifications\n(i) What is an aircraft maintenance licence?\nThe aircraft maintenance industry is highly regulated as any minor error can result in an aircraft crashing with lives lost. Therefore, aviation authorities around the world require aircraft maintenance engineers and technicians to be licensed in order to carry out maintenance work on an aircraft.\nDifferent regulatory bodies have different geographical jurisdictions. Some examples are:\n- Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM), previously known as the Department of Civil Aviation Malaysia (DCAM), for Malaysia\n- European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) for the European Union\n- Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) for Singapore\n- Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) for Australia\nThese authorities issue professional aircraft maintenance licences which enables you to become a Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (LAME) or an Aircraft Maintenance Technician (AMT).\n(ii) What licence is required to be an aircraft maintenance professional in Malaysia?\nIn Malaysia, the aviation authority is the Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM). It issues the DCAM Part-66 Aircraft Maintenance Licence (AML), which is the licence that you will need to be a licensed aircraft maintenance professional.\nThere are several categories under this licence, which differentiates between an aircraft maintenance technician and an aircraft maintenance engineer. The different categories of licence will allow you perform different types of aircraft maintenance tasks.\n- Category A (Aircraft Maintenance Technician): Allows you to issue certificates of release to service (CRS) following minor scheduled line maintenance and simple defect rectification with limited certification privileges.\n- Category B1 (Aircraft Maintenance Engineer – Mechanical): Allows you to issue certificates of release to service (CRS) and certificates of fitness of aircrafts following the maintenance of aircraft structure, engine, mechanical and electrical systems. This licence also covers Category A certification privileges.\n- Category B2 (Aircraft Maintenance Engineer – Avionics): Allows you to issue certificates of release to service (CRS) following the maintenance of avionic, electrical and electronic systems used for navigation, communications and flight control. This licence does not cover Category A certification privileges.\n(iii) What are the requirements to obtain a DCAM Part-66 Aircraft Maintenance Licence?\nTo apply for the DCAM Part-66 Aircraft Maintenance Licence, you must be at least 21 years old and pass SPM with a credit in English.\nFormal education, such as having a diploma or a degree, is not necessary if you have the relevant practical aircraft maintenance experience. However, enrolling yourself in a training centre will equip you with the necessary knowledge and skills. In addition, many institutions will also provide you with adequate practical experience and industrial training, which will be helpful when you take your professional papers.\n(iv) How about the EASA Part-66 Aircraft Maintenance Licence?\nThe European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) Part-66 Aircraft Maintenance Licence, which is offered by some institutions in Malaysia, is a similar professional aircraft maintenance licence with some differences.\nNotably, the EASA licence allows you to work abroad as it is recognised in the European Union (e.g. UK, France, Germany, Netherlands) and selected countries overseas. However, if you want to practise in Malaysia, you will need to obtain a DCAM licence, which is generally only recognised in Malaysia.\nc) How does your education pathway look like?\nAfter SPM or O-Level, you can either take a Diploma in Aircraft Maintenance or pre-university or foundation course, which will lead you to a degree.\nUpon completing your Diploma or Degree in Aircraft Maintenance, you can pursue a professional aircraft maintenance qualification (e.g. DCAM Part-66 AML to work in Malaysia, EASA Part-66 AML for Europe, etc.) to be able to certify the airworthiness of an aircraft. This can be done either full-time or part-time while working and gaining practical experience.\nNote that the DCAM Part-66 licence is only valid for 2 years and is subject to renewal.\nd) What Will You Study in an Aircraft Maintenance Course?\nThe topics that you will likely come across while studying a Diploma in Aircraft Maintenance or professional qualification might include:\n- Maintenance Practices\n- Materials and Hardware\n- Electrical Fundamentals\n- Aircraft Landing Gears\n- Aircraft Hydraulics and Pneumatics\n- Instrument and Avionics Systems\n- Piston Engine\n- Gas Turbine Engine\n#3. Why Should You Study Aircraft Maintenance?\nIf you’ve always been intrigued by the way planes work and don’t mind getting your hands dirty, aircraft maintenance might be the career for you! Here are some reasons you should study aircraft maintenance.\n(a) You have a knack for fixing things\nDo you enjoy dismantling and reassembling objects around you to understand how they work? Whether it’s a simple household item or a complex machine, discovering and improving the inner workings of machines gives you a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment.\nb) You are a hands-on person\nAre you the type of person who prefers working with machines over human beings any day? If you’re keen on getting your hands dirty to solve problems, this career could be just the thing for you. It goes without saying that aircraft maintenance technicians and engineers must possess a high level of technical skill to ensure precision and quality in their work, as well as to assure the safety of an aircraft based on industry standards.\n(c) You are detailed-oriented\nTo excel in aircraft maintenance, you must have a keen eye for detail as you will be working with large and small structural components within an aircraft, in addition to other important components. You must also be able to detect minor changes in the way the aircraft performs and troubleshoot problems effectively to ensure optimum airworthiness as it affects the safety of passengers.\n#4. What Skills Do You Need to Study Aircraft Maintenance?\n(a) Good organisational skills\nAircraft maintenance engineers and technicians must maintain a meticulous inventory of the components required for repair and equipment replacement, in addition to carefully documenting all pre-flight inspections and maintenance of the aircraft between flights. It’s equally important to know which procedures to prioritise to ensure all the required checks are done, without any room for error. You may also be required to work on weekends and at night, so be prepared to manage your life around your rotating shifts.\n(b) Good decision-making skills\nRisk-based decision-making is crucial as aircraft maintenance engineers will inevitably need to make decisions about the condition of aircraft components, what types of wear and tear can be tolerated, as well as what parts need to be repaired or replaced. These decisions have critical consequences and must be made with extreme care and consideration.\n(c) Good problem-solving skills\nOne of the main roles of an aircraft maintenance engineer is to discern the problems within an aircraft and to find quick and safe solutions to these issues. This aptitude for problem-solving must be coupled with sophisticated technical knowledge to ensure that the safest and most efficient solution is used, and involves the application of knowledge from several fields, including mathematics and engineering principles.\n#5. What Career Options Do You Have With an Aircraft Maintenance Qualification?\nAfter completing your aircraft maintenance course, your job titles may include:\n- Aircraft Maintenance Technician\n- Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (Mechanical)\n- Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (Avionics)\n- Aero Components Repair Technician\n- Quality Assurance Engineer\n- Airworthiness Inspector\n- Technical Services Engineer\nIf you pursue your career abroad, you may have to obtain the relevant professional qualifications (e.g EASA Part-66 Aircraft Maintenance Licence for Europe, General Civil Aviation (GCAA) License for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) )to advance your career.\n#6.

{"question":"As a forest pathologist, I'm curious about the transport mechanisms of these two invasive tree killers - how do the emerald ash borer and Dutch elm disease spread to new trees?","answer":"The emerald ash borer spreads when adult beetles lay eggs and their larvae feed under the bark, consuming the tree's phloem and cambium. Dutch elm disease spreads in two ways: through elm bark beetles that carry fungal spores as they burrow into new trees, and through root systems when infected tree roots graft together with healthy tree roots. Both pests were introduced to North America through international trade - EAB likely arrived in wood packing material, while Dutch elm disease came on diseased timber from Europe.","context":["Here in Montreal, there have recently been a lot of tree losses due the emerald ash borer (EAB). When walking around my neighbourhood, my heart breaks when I see big, beautiful ash trees flagged for removal because of the wrath of the EAB. All this had me wondering: how did it all start and how do we stop it? Logically, if it is killing these trees at such an alarming rate, then it can’t possibly be natural, or at least not natural for this part of the world.\nThe EAB has been a problem in North America since it was first noticed, in Detroit and Windsor back in 2002, but of course, the insect probably arrived on the continent, several years earlier. The pest is native to Asia, living in and feeding off trees of similar genus or family to the ash tree. It is not considered a pest in Asia because Asian ash trees tend to be more resistant and the pest occurs at lower densities, however, its behaviours and impacts are much different in North America. The EAB most likely arrived in solid wood packing material that was being imported to North America. Finding the ash tree as a suitable host, it was able to establish and multiply, causing increasingly devastating losses to ash tree populations. This is particularly problematic for urban areas because ash trees are frequently planted in urban forests due to their shaded-providing and aesthetic properties.\nThe adult EABs are not the ones that cause significant harm the trees, it is actually their larvae. They live underneath the bark, feeding off the internal fibres of the tree, specifically, the phloem and the cambium of the tree, impeding water and nutrient supply to outer parts of the tree, causing it to die within 3 years.\nIt is difficult (unless you are a professional) to notice if an ash tree is infested before it is too late for treatment. Some noticeable signs are loss of foliage and new shoots appearing on the trunk of the tree, which is the tree’s natural response to loss of foliage. Closer to the end of its life, the bark of the tree will crack open or bulge near to where the larvae have been feeding.\nOnce a tree is infested, in can either be treated or cut down. Treatment is only possible for larger ash trees (15 cm or more in diameter) that have lost less than 30% of their foliage. In urban areas, smaller trees and trees that are too far gone, must be cut down as there is no other way to save it and they are at risk of falling down suddenly and harming someone.\nCutting down all infested trees, is not an effective solution to eliminating the EAB problem, as the EAB will just find another host tree. There is still a lot of research being done on this front, and it is suspected that biological controls and natural tree resistance can be possible contributors to the control or eradication of the EAB in North America. Biological controls have a long history of causing more problems than they solve, so it is possible that with population control via treatment of infested trees and regulations on transported materials, the problem will eventually be solved as ash trees gain natural resistance.\nHere are some pictures I’ve taken of local ash trees that have been seriously infested:","Dutch Elm Disease\nDutch elm disease is caused by a fungus (Ophiostoma novo-ulmi; O. ulmi) that affects elm trees, primarily the American elm (Ulmus americana). The fungus grows in the xylem layer of the tree, blocking the movement of water and nutrients, which eventually girdles and kills the tree. The fungus is transported to host trees on elm bark beetles which feed on the bark, creating wounds through which the fungus spores can enter the tree. The fungus can also move through the root system of diseased trees into the roots of adjacent trees if the roots have grafted together.\nsigns and symptoms\nSymptoms develop quickly, usually within 4-5 weeks after infection. The first visual symptom is called “flagging”, which is when the leaves on one or more branches begin wilting and yellowing. Flagging may begin in a discrete part of the crown but can rapidly spread to all branches. Eventually, the leaves may die and fall. Brown streaking can be seen under the bark in the xylem. This brown discoloration looks like a circle of brown dots when observed in a cross section.\nSee image slideshow above for signs and symptoms.\nDutch elm disease was first described in Holland in 1921, although it is thought to have originated in Asia. It was introduced into the United States in the 1930’s on diseased timber from Europe. It rapidly spread across the country, reaching the west coast in 1973. Since its arrival, it has killed over 40 million American elm trees and has proven to be one of the most destructive shade tree diseases in North America.\nThe fungus reproduces through spores that are stored in the xylem of the host tree. Bark beetles burrow through the bark into the wood to lay their eggs, and in that process spores become attached to their bodies. When the beetles travel to a new elm tree, they transport the fungal spores and thus spread the pathogen. The pathogen can also spread between root systems of trees if they are planted close enough together to allow root grafting. From the point of inoculation, the fungus moves up and down the trunk through the xylem. Once the fungus reaches the root system, it may ascend the trunk in a wave of infection that kills the whole tree or a major section of it.\nThe American elm tree was an important forest and urban tree in North America, up until the early 1900’s. Its form and tolerance of the urban environment made it a favored street tree across the United States. It was also a prominent species in bottomland forests, greatly contributing to the health of riparian ecosystems. Since the disease’s arrival in the 1930’s, over 40 million American elm trees have been killed, and today it continues to suppress the population of elm trees in forested ecosystems. American elms can still be found in forests since the tree is a prolific seed producer and grows quickly, allowing many trees to bear seed before succumbing to the disease.\nCheryl Kaiser, University of Kentucky, Bugwood.org\nGeorge Hudler, Cornell University, Bugwood.org\nUK Forestry Commission, Bugwood.org\nWilliam M.

{"question":"I am a gemology student studying diamond discoveries in USA. Can you tell me if the largest red diamond (Moussaieff Red) or the largest Arkansas diamond (Uncle Sam) was bigger in carats?","answer":"The Uncle Sam diamond found in Arkansas was larger at 40.23 carats, compared to the Moussaieff Red Diamond which was only 13.9 carats in its rough state and 5.11 carats after cutting.","context":["Amateur Prospector Finds 2.78-Carat Diamond in the Same Spot Where 'Strawn-Wagner' Was Discovered in 1990\nMay 31, 2017\nBack in 1990, a Murfreesboro, Ark., resident named Shirley Strawn became an instant celebrity when she struck it rich at the nearby Crater of Diamonds State Park — the only diamond site in the world where amateur prospectors get to keep what they find.\nStrawn discovered a 3.03-carat diamond in the East Drain section of the park's 37 1/2-acre search area. Gemologists determined that the rough stone had so much potential as a faceted diamond that it was sent to New York, where famous diamond cutter Lazare Kaplan International worked its magic. The Arkansas-sourced rough gem was transformed into a world-class, 1.09-carat round brilliant-cut sparkler, and became the first diamond from the state park to earn a perfect grade of \"Triple Zero\" (Ideal cut/D color/Flawless) from the American Gem Society.\nThe find was so momentous that the State of Arkansas purchased the gem — now known as the \"Strawn-Wagner\" diamond — for $34,700 and made it the centerpiece of the park's special exhibit. There's even a prominent marker in the East Drain section of the park to show exactly where it was found.\nOnly a few weeks ago, a retiree named Wendell Fox was scanning the ground very close to the Strawn-Wagner marker when he, too, spotted a diamond on the surface. While Strawn's gem was white and weighed 3.03 carats in its rough state, Fox's gem weighed 2.78 carats and displayed a champagne brown color.\n“I was 80 to 90 percent sure that it was a diamond when I saw it,” the 70-year-old Fox told park officials. About the size of an English pea, the oval diamond contains a few inclusions and demonstrates an unmistakable metallic shine.\nPark Interpreter Waymon Cox noted, “It’s no surprise that Mr. Fox found his diamond by surface searching. It has rained a lot at the park this spring and, so far, we have registered 11 diamonds that were found on top of the ground in May.”\nCox explained that diamonds lack static electricity so dirt doesn't stick to them. When rainfall uncovers larger diamonds near the surface and the sun comes out, they sparkle and are often easier to see.\nAlthough Fox and his wife, Jennifer, are now retired and living in Joliet, Mont., Fox spent his formative years in Arkansas and always dreamed of searching for diamonds at the park. His wish came true a few weeks ago when the couple visited for the first time.\nWendall and Jennifer have named their diamond \"Way Out Yonder\" to honor their home in Montana and plan to have the gem mounted in a piece of jewelry.\n“All in all, it was a great experience,” said Wendell Fox. “Finding a diamond was just icing on the cake.”\nSo far this year, the Crater of Diamonds State Park has registered 209 diamonds weighing a total of 52.08 carats. Seven diamonds have weighed in at more than 1 carat each. In March, 14-year-old Kalel Langford of Centerton, Ark., made headlines when he secured a 7.44-carat brown gem that he named “Superman’s Diamond.” The largest diamond ever discovered in the United States was unearthed in Murfreesboro in 1924 during an early mining operation. Named the Uncle Sam, the white diamond with a pink cast weighed 40.23 carats.\nCredits: Images courtesy of Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism.","top of page\nFamous Colored Diamonds.\nThe hope diamond.\nThe Hope Diamond, also known as \"Le Bijou du Roi\" (\"the King's Jewel\") \"Le bleu de France\" (\"the Blue of France\"), and the Tavernier Blue, is a large, 45.52-carat (9.104 g) deep-blue diamond, now housed in the Smithsonian Natural History Museum in Washington, D.C. It is blue to the naked eye because of trace amounts of boron within its crystal structure, and exhibits red phosphorescence after exposure to ultraviolet light. It is classified as a Type IIb diamond, and is notorious for supposedly being cursed. It has a long recorded history, with few gaps, in which it changed hands numerous times on its way from India to France to Britain and to the United States. It has been described as the \"most famous diamond in the world\nMoussaieff Red Diamond.\nThe Moussaieff Red Diamond (formerly known as the Red Shield Diamond) is a diamond measuring 5.11 carats (1.022 g) with a triangular brilliant cut (sometimes called a trillion or a trilliant cut), rated in color as Fancy Red by the Gemological Institute of America. It is the world's largest known red diamond.\nThe Moussaieff Red was discovered in the 1990s by a Brazilian farmer in the Abaetezinho river in 1990, in a region known as Alto Paranaiba. The rough stone weighed 13.9 carats (2.78 g) The diamond was purchased and cut by the William Goldberg Diamond Corp. where it went by its original name, the Red Shield. It was purchased in 2001 or 2002 by Shlomo Moussaieff, an Israeli-born jewelry dealer in London, and is currently owned by Moussaieff Jewellers Ltd.\nThe Moussaieff Red was displayed as part of the Smithsonian's \"The Splendor of Diamonds\" exhibit, alongside The De Beers Millennium Star and The Heart of Eternity.\nThe Pink Srar Diamond.\nThe Pink Star, formerly known as the Steinmetz Pink, is a diamond weighing 59.60 carats (11.92 g), rated in color as Fancy Vivid Pink by the Gemological Institute of America. The Pink Star was mined by De Beers in 1999 in South Africa, and weighed 132.5 carats in the rough. The Pink Star is the largest known diamond having been rated Vivid Pink. As a result of this exceptional rarity, the Steinmetz Group took a cautious 20 months to cut the Pink. It was unveiled in Monaco on 29 May 2003 in a public ceremony.\nThe Pink Star was displayed (as the Steinmetz Pink) as part of the Smithsonian's \"The Splendor of Diamonds\" exhibit, alongside the De Beers Millennium Star, the world’s second largest (the Centenary Diamond is the largest) top colour (D) internally and externally flawless pear-shaped diamond at 203.04 carat (40.608 g), the Heart of Eternity Diamond, a 27.64 carat (5.582 g) heart-cut blue diamond and the Moussaieff Red Diamond, the world's largest known Fancy Red diamond at 5.11 carats (1.102 g).\nThe Pink Star was sold privately in 2007 but neither the identity of the buyer nor the price is on public record.\nDresden Green Diamond.\nThe Dresden Green Diamond, also known as \"Dresden Green\", is a 41 carats (8.2 g) natural green diamond, which probably originated in the Kollur mine in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India.\nThe Dresden Green is a rare Type IIa, and it is said to be internally flawless.\nIt is named after Dresden, the capital of Saxony, Germany where it has been on display for most of the last two centuries. Today, the diamond is shown in the \"New Green Vault\" at Dresden Castle.\nThe Dresden Green Diamond has a historical record dating back to 1722, when a London news-sheet carried an article about it in its 25 October-27th edition. It was acquired by Augustus III of Poland from a Dutch merchant in 1742 at the Leipzig Fair. In 1768, the diamond was incorporated into an extremely valuable hat ornament, surrounded by two large and 411 medium-sized and small diamonds. This is the setting that the Dresden Green still appears in today.\nIn 2000, American jeweler, Harry Winston arranged to display the Dresden Green at the New York flagship store and then at theSmithsonian in Washington DC, USA, where it was displayed in the Harry Winston pavilion next to the largest blue diamond in the world, the Hope Diamond.\nThe Allnatt Diamond.\nThe Allnatt Diamond is a diamond measuring 101.29 carats (20.258 g) with a cushion cut, rated in color as Fancy Vivid Yellow by the Gemological Institute of America. This diamond is named after one of its holders, Major Alfred Ernest Allnatt, a soldier, sportsman, art patron and benefactor. While it is not known precisely where the Allnatt originated, many experts believe that it was probably found in what is now known as the De Beers Premier Diamond Mine.The Allnatt's origins are unknown prior to Major Allnatt's purchasing of the diamond in the early 1950s. After purchasing the diamond, he commissioned Cartier to make a setting for it. The final setting was a platinum flower with five petals, a stem and two leaves, all set with diamonds. The Allnatt was resold at auction in May 1996 by Christie's in Geneva for $3,043,496 US. At the time of its sale the Allnatt was 102.07 carats (20.414 g). and was graded Fancy Intense Yellow. After being sold to the SIBA Corporation, the diamond was re-cut to its current weight and the intensity was upgraded as a result.The Allnatt was displayed as part of the Smithsonian's \"The Splendor of Diamonds\" exhibit, alongside The De Beers Millennium Star and The Heart of Eternity.\nThe De Grisogono Green Diamond.\nValue: $7.3 million.\nThis beautiful diamond has the power to convince any beauty to accept the advances of a suitor. The de Grisogono Green Diamond is the crowning glory of a stunning white gold ring that is surrounded with black diamonds worth seven carats. The de Grisogono Green Diamond is a rare pale green diamond. The only other diamond that can rival this beauty is the 41-carat Dresden Green, which is on display at the Dresden Castle in Germany. The de Grisogono Green Diamond is a cushion-cut gem measuring 25 carats.

Organic products must meet the same food safety standards that apply to all food for sale in New Zealand. The organic standards focus on production methods like avoiding synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, while food safety standards apply to all foods regardless of production method to assess safety and suitability.","context":["Find out about the requirements for producing, selling, or exporting New Zealand-made organic products, or for importing organic products to this country.\nWhat 'organic' means\n'Organic' is a labelling term used on products produced in accordance with organic production standards, which may be certified by a certification body or authority.\nOrganic agriculture is based on minimising the use of external inputs. For example, avoiding or excluding the use of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides, antibiotics, growth promotants, genetic modification, and irradiation. Organic handlers, processors, and retailers follow voluntary standards to maintain the integrity of organically produced products.\nIt's important to note that organic certification standards are not food safety standards. Organic products must meet the same food safety standards that apply to all food for sale in New Zealand. Read about MPI's organic food policy and the background behind it:\nOrganic food is treated in the same way as all other foods by MPI. This means that the same risk management framework for assessing safety and suitability is applied to all food for sale in New Zealand, including organic food, and the products used in its production.\nMPI will, where appropriate, provide authoritative information in relation to organic food so consumers can make informed decisions.\nMPI will continue to develop its role as the government certifier for organic food exports.\nBackground to MPI’s organic food policy\nOrganic agriculture and food production systems avoid or exclude the use of most synthetic pest control compounds and fertilisers, antibiotics, growth promotants, and food additives derived from non-organic sources, as well as genetic modification and irradiation.\nOrganic food must meet the same safety and suitability standards as other foods for sale in New Zealand. These include, as appropriate, the labelling and composition standards of the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) Code – for example, requirements for allergen warnings, date markings, manufacturer/distributor/importer contact details, ingredient listing, and nutrition information.\nMPI monitors chemical residues and microbiological hazards in a range of foods, including organic foods.

{"question":"How were German U-boats detected along US coasts during WW2, and what was their typical operating pattern near American shores?","answer":"German U-boats were detected through various naval patrols, including aircraft reconnaissance like the Lockheed Hudson PBO-1 patrols that searched for periscopes and surface activity. The U-boats typically operated within 10 miles of shore, where they could see cities and ships silhouetted against shore lights and even listen to American jazz radio stations. They would rest on the ocean bottom during daylight hours to conserve fuel and batteries, then surface at night to search for targets.","context":["Shadows of War\nIn the years of European warfare between\n1939 and December 7, 1941, the German U-Boat menace became a\ndeadly noose around the Island nation of Great Britain. So\nthoroughly was the German blockade prosecuted that Prime Minister\nWinston Churchill proclaimed it his \"greatest worry\".\nGerman submarines roamed nearly unmolested, silently stalking\nconvoys of urgently needed supplies making their way to England,\nand sending tons of shipping to the ocean floor with deadly\nGermany and Italy declared war on the United\nStates on December 11, 1941, only days after the attack at Pearl\nHarbor prompted the U.S. Congress to declare war on Japan.\nImmediately after that German declaration, the United States\nCongress granted President Roosevelt a declaration of war against\nGermany and Italy, confronting our nation with a two-front war.\nWhile the early battles in the Pacific\ndominated the news, and while within a year the American landings\nin North Africa signaled the opening of that second offensive\nfront, little is often recalled of the battle at home. But World\nWar II was NOT entirely a war fought on foreign shores. There were\nof course, the battles fought on American soil at Pearl Harbor,\nGuam, and even in the Territory of Alaska. But often forgotten is\nthe fact that some of the war's most costly battles were also\nfought along the eastern seaboard of the United States.\nThe first American offensive action against\na German submarine occurred as early as April 10, 1941. On that\ndate the U.S.S. Niblack (DD-424) was conducting reconnaissance off\nthe coast of Iceland when the destroyer located three life boats\ncontaining survivors from a recently torpedoed Dutch freighter.\nWhile attempting a rescue, a German submarine was detected, and\nappeared to be moving in to attack. The American commander ordered\na depth charge attack, his pre-emptive actions driving off the\nenemy sub in what was probably the first clash between American\nand German forces (excluding the Eagle Squadron pilots who flew\nduring the Battle of Britain) in World War II.\nAgain, on September 4, 1941, an American\ndestroyer and a German U-Boat engaged each other near Iceland. The\nU.S.S. Greer successfully evaded two German torpedoes and dropped\n19 depth charges, becoming the first American ship to offensively\nattack German forces in a war that had not yet begun. Following\nthe U.S.S. Greer incident, President Roosevelt ordered all U.S.\nNaval vessels to attack any ship that threatened American shipping\nor the shipping of a foreign nation under escort by American\nheadline announcing the German attack on the U.S.S. Kearny\n(DD-432) was more than another detail of war on the American home\nfront. For the United States, World War II had not yet even begun.\nOn October 16, 1942, the Kearny was one of\nfive American destroyers that raced to the site of German U-Boat\nattacks on a convoy near Iceland. On the following day Commander\nAnthony L. Danis daringly maneuvered his ship to protect the\nconvoy, suffering a direct torpedo hit on the starboard side that\nkilled eleven American sailors and wounded twenty-two. Danis, his\nEngineering Officer Lieutenant Robert Esslinger, and Chief\nMachinist's Mate Aucie McDaniel earned the Navy Cross for their\nactions to get their wounded vessel safely to port.\nTwo weeks later the U.S.S. Salinas (AO-19),\nan oiler based out of Argentia, Newfoundland, was returning to\nthe United States when it was struck by two German torpedoes.\nThough no Americans were killed in the attack, one sailor was\nwounded and the ship was badly damaged in the October 30, 1941,\nincident that earned the ship's Commanding Officer and four\nmembers of his crew the Navy Cross.\nThe following day while the Salinas was\nlimping for port, the U.S.S. Reuben James (DD-245) was escorting a\nconvoy from Halifax, Nova Scotia, when it was attacked by the\nGerman U-552 and sunk. Only 44 men of the 159 members of the\ncrew survived, nearly a quarter of the survivors suffering wounds.\nThe Reuben James was the first American ship lost in combat in\nWorld War II, and the United States was STILL not even at war.\nThe prelude to war should have served as\nample warning as to what lay in store once war was actually\ndeclared. Less than a week after war was declared, Adolph Hitler\nlaunched Operation Paukenschlag, a direct attack on shipping off\nthe American eastern seaboard. Five German U-Boats departed for\nAmerican waters between December 18 - 24, 1941, arriving to begin\noperations by mid-January. On January 11 the U-123 sank the SS\nCyclops less than 300 miles east of Cape Cod. Over the following\nweeks the Paukenschlag U-Boats scored near-daily victories along\nthe American coast. Twenty-five American ships were lost in 26\nDeath of a Lady\nReports of the casualties were crushing to\nthe American public, already reeling from the daily bad news\ncoming from the Pacific War. But the bad news on this this other\nfront carried with it a unique undercurrent to feed American\nfears. The ships sinking, planes falling, and soldiers dying in\nthe face of the Japanese offensive were far away. The casualties\nbeing suffered to Hitler's U-Boats were close to home; so close,\nthat the fires of burning and sinking American ships could be seen\nalong the coast at night. An American fisherman who made his\nliving from the sea was now also vulnerable to the enemy when he\nventured out to his daily job.\nreality of the danger to civilians became poignantly clear on\nJanuary 19. Three days earlier the Canadian Steamship \"Lady\nHawkins\" had departed Halifax for Bermuda, stopping at Boston\nen route to pick up additional passengers. The course was a normal\nroute for the luxury liner that carried primarily civilian\ntourists, crew and passengers numbering some 300 on this trip.\nAmong them were 40 young men from St. Joseph, Missouri, who had\nboarded for passage to promised construction jobs awaiting their\narrival in Bermuda.\nWith the threat of German U-Boats\nincreasing, the captain hugged the American coast line as far as\nCape Hatteras before making his eastward turn towards Bermuda.\nShortly after midnight on January 19, the \"Lady Hawkins\"\nwas briefly illuminated by a bright search light from U-66, and,\nmoments later shuddered under the impact of two torpedoes. Though\nthe ship was only 130 miles from land, most of those aboard her\nwere doomed. Six life boats were destroyed by the torpedoes, and\nonly 76 survivors managed to crowd into the only remaining life\nboat, which rated a maximum capacity of 63 persons.\nFor five days the survivors languished at\nsea, surviving on a ration of one biscuit, one-quarter of a cup of\nwater, and two teaspoons of condensed milk. Five died during the\nordeal before the S.S. Coamo spotted the life boat and took the 71\nsurvivors, including a two-year-old girl, aboard on January 24.\nOnly thirteen of the 40 young men from St. Joseph survived,\nprompting the local newspaper to write, \"May the U-Boat\nthat struck by stealth, bringing death to more than a score of St.\nJoseph citizens, meet with such a fate.\"\nThe death of the \"Lady Hawkins\"\nand the loss of more than 200 civilians only heightened the fear\nat home in the United States. To make matters worse, the same day\nthat the story of the Canadian ship's fate reached the press, a\nCoast Guard ship arrived at Chincoteague, Virginia, bearing\neleven survivors of the American merchant ship \"Francis E.\nPowell\". (Seventeen other survivors were also picked up by the\ntanker \"W. C. Fairbanks\" and returned to shore in\nDelaware). The Powell had been en route from Port Arthur, Texas,\nto Providence, Rhode Island, when it was attacked and sunk on\nJanuary 27 by U-130. The news gave credibility to the rumors that\nat least two German submarines were operating in the Gulf of\nTime magazine subsequently reported that \"U.S.\nand Allied ships were being sunk at a disastrous rate, probably\nequal to the rate at which new ones were being commissioned.\nSubmarines had to be sunk faster than Adolf Hitler could turn them\nout, complete with trained crews....Off the southeastern coast, a\nU-Boat slipped in shore and sank two barges and a tug with\ngunfire.

The\nplane carried a crew of three, AMM1c Algia Baldwin as Co-Pilot,\nAMM2c Albert Zink as Plane Captain, and Radioman Charles Mellinger.\nShortly after 1:00 p.m. on January 28,\n1942, Mason and his crew took off for what was a continuing series\nof anti-submarine patrols over the Atlantic waters that had\nalready become known as \"Torpedo Alley\". For two hours\nthe PBO-1 droned over empty waters. As was all too often the case,\nthe long but important patrols were mundane. On this afternoon\nhowever, an unexpected flash of light was spotted on the surface\nof the dark and rough open waters of the Atlantic. Banking\nquickly, the crew noticed a periscope protruding above the waves,\na distinct wake trailing behind.\nWithout hesitation, AMM1c Mason launched his\nattack, bearing in on the enemy submarine that apparently did not\nrealize it had been spotted. The subsequent report filed by Patrol\nSquadron Eighty-Two Commander W. L. Erdmann vividly explained the\ncombat action in brief but precise terms:\nUNITED STATES ATLANTIC FLEET\nPATROL WING EIGHT\nPATROL SQUADRON EIGHTY-TWO\nArgentia Air Detachment\nJanuary 30, 1942\nFrom: Commander Patrol Squadron\nTo: Commander-in-Chief, U.S.\nVia: Official Channels.\nReport of Engagement with Enemy Submarine on January 28, 1942\nPlane turned and attacked at once.\nSubmarine was apparently completely surprised, as periscope\nwas visible throughout entire attack. Approach was made\nfrom astern submarine on a course about 20 degrees across\nsubmarine's course. Bombs were released at estimated\naltitude of 25 feet, indicated air speed 165 knots. Two\nbombs were dropped with a spread of about 25 feet.\nPlumes of the explosions were seen to spread,\none on either side of periscope, estimated distance 10 feet\nfrom wake line and nearly abreast the periscope. The\nsubmarine was lifted bodily in the water until most of the\nconning tower could be seen. Headway of submarine seemed\nto be killed at once and she was observed to sink from sight\nvertically. Five minutes later, oil began to bubble to\nthe surface and continued for ten minutes. At this time\nit was necessary to leave area in order to return to base by\ndark.

Roper in a night surface\naction off the coast of North Carolina on April 14,","(originally published in Avenue magazine, June 2005)\nBy Joel Mangum\nCape Lookout – Many people may not realize how close the fight of WWII came to our land. The second sub to be sunk in U.S. waters and the first to be sunk by the US Coast Guard occurred just 30 miles offshore from Topsail Beach, south of Cape Lookout. Another landmark event occurred when 33 German POWs were taken from that same sunken sub and became the first foreign troops to be interned on U.S. soil since the War of 1812.\nIn early 1942, German U-boats were patrolling the eastern U.S. coast from Maine to Florida, and wreaking havoc on American supply ships. During January and February of that year, more than 60 allied ships were sunk by U-boats, some in broad daylight and using only the deck guns of the submarine. Some German sailors dubbed their missions “American Hunting Season” because of the easy pickings.\nWhat’s even more shocking is the U-boats were sometimes within 10 miles of shore, able to see cities and ships silhouetted in shore lights. U-boats were close enough to listen to jazz radio stations being broadcast from the U.S. mainland. During daylight the sub would sit on the ocean bottom, conserving fuel and batteries and resting the crew. At night, the U-boat would surface and look for targets.\nCaptain Helmut Rathke of U-352 was assigned to patrol the shipping routes of North Carolina from Cape Hatteras to Cape Lookout and was under orders to sink any supply ships they sighted. After two weeks of no definite targets, Rathke and his crew were desperate to sink a ship and spotted what they thought was a small freighter at 4:25 p.m. on May 9, 1942. They fired a torpedo they initially thought to be a direct hit, but moments later realized the target was not a freighter, but actually the fully armed USCG warship Icarus. The U-352’s torpedo was off the mark and exploded prematurely 200 yards off the port quarter. The crew of Icarus immediately went into battle mode and dropped five depth charges where they thought the U-boat to be. Depth charges are canisters of explosives dropped from ships that detonate when reaching a certain point under water.\nBecause the U-352 was operating in only 100 feet of water, they could not crash-dive far enough to evade their attackers. After three more depth charges were dropped by Icarus, the U-352 broke apart and surfaced at a latitude of 34.12 degrees north and longitude of 76.35 degrees west, with 33 men spilling out of the conning tower. Fifteen other Germans went down with the ship.\nAccording to U.S. Navy Department records, 45 minutes went by before the German survivors were rescued. One Icarus crewman even told the Germans bobbing in the water, “Gentlemen, I wish you a good evening-down with the sharks!”\nBecause there were no regulations or precedents on picking up prisoners of war, Icarus radioed headquarters three times before getting a response. After motoring away from the men in the water, the Icarus crew was ordered to turn back, pick up the survivors and land them at Charleston, S.C. for interrogation. Prisoners were brought on board and searched, then given sandwiches and coffee. Most prisoners were in good spirits because for them it meant the war was over. Many commented on the good treatment by their American captors.\nAccording to interrogation reports of the U.S. Navy, Captain Rathke had coached his crew well in the importance of not giving valuable information, even warning his men in the water before being rescued the punishments for revealing intelligence. U.S. and British investigators learned much about where the best bars and brothels were in Germany from the prisoners, but found out little about war operations and the U-boat fleets. The prisoners remained in Charleston for several days and then transferred to Fort Bragg, N.C. They did not return to Germany until 1947.\nCaptain Rathke made some of his opinions on the war known to interrogators such as disliking the Japanese but having to accept them as allies against Russia. He also dined with Hitler and would note how attentively the ruler would listen to conversations and his “amazing knowledge of detail.” Rathke also gave the view that England could not be invaded and refused to believe that German soldiers had committed atrocities upon Poland and Poles.\nU-352 remains a dive site today. The commander of the Icarus, Lieutenant Maurice D. Jester was awarded the Navy Cross and promoted. Gerd Reussel, a young German sailor who died of his wounds aboard the Icarus, was buried with full military honors in the National Cemetery at Beaufort, S.C. and his grave remains there today. News of other U-boats sank made news normally but for unknown reasons, no word of the U-352 was reported until months following the event.

{"question":"What are the immediate health effects of exposure to air pollution on the human body?","answer":"The immediate health effects of air pollution include aggravated cardiovascular and respiratory problems, increased strain on heart and lungs, damage to respiratory cells, wheezing, chest pain, dry throat, headache, nausea, increased reactivity to allergens, eye irritation, reduced immunity to infection, and increased fatigue.","context":["Sunday, 26 January 2014\nAIR POLLUTION AND HEALTH PROBLEMS\nAir is the mixture of gases that surround earth due to its gravitational pull. It is colourless, odourless and tasteless mixture that forms earth’s atmosphere. It contains Nitrogen (79.1%), Oxygen (20.0%), Carbon dioxide (0.03%) and traces of inert gases like argon, krypton, xenon, neon, helium, ammonia, ozone, water vapour and suspended particles (0.07%).\nWe need air to perform certain vital life functions. All human beings and animals breathe in Oxygen and breathe out Carbon dioxide. Plants breathe in Carbon dioxide and breathe out oxygen in the day time to manufacture their own food through Photosynthesis. But they follow the pattern of animals at the night. Without Air there would be no transmission of sound and radiation waves, no burning of fire and cycle of seasons.\nWhen the natural composition of air is altered to such an extent, so as to make it harmful for living creatures primarily due to human activities, air is said to be ‘polluted’. Any substance that causes pollution is called pollutant. Pollutants can be solid, liquid or gaseous substance.\nAir is polluted by natural ways of volcanic eruptions, forest fires, pollen from plants etc. However, nature has a way of balancing itself. Our concern here is man caused pollution which is looming largely as a threat to modern civilization. Pollution can be INDOOR as well as OUTDOOR:\nINDOOR AIR POLLUTION refers to the physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of air in the indoor environment within a home, building, or an institution or commercial facility. Indoor air pollution is a concern in the developed countries, where energy efficiency improvements sometimes make houses relatively airtight, reducing ventilation and raising pollutant levels. Indoor air problems can be subtle and do not always produce easily recognized impacts on health. Tobacco smoke, cooking and heating appliances, and vapors from building materials, paints, furniture, etc. cause pollution inside buildings.\nVolatile organic compounds originate mainly from solvents and the main indoor sources are perfumes, hair sprays, furniture polish, glues, air fresheners, moth repellents, wood preservatives, and many other products used in the house. Their main health effect is the imitation of the eye, nose and throat. In more severe cases there may be headaches, nausea and loss of coordination. In the long term, some of the pollutants are suspected to damage to the liver and other parts of the body.\nTobacco smoke generates a wide range of harmful chemicals and is known to cause cancer. It is well known that passive smoking causes a wide range of problems to the passive smoker (the person who is in the same room with a smoker and is not himself/herself a smoker) ranging from burning eyes, nose, and throat irritation to cancer, bronchitis, severe asthma, and a decrease in lung function.\nBiological pollutants include pollen from plants, mite, hair from pets, fungi, parasites, and some bacteria. Most of them are allergens and can cause asthma, hay fever, and other allergic diseases.\nFormaldehyde is a gas that comes mainly from carpets, particle boards, and insulation foam. It causes irritation to the eyes and nose and may cause allergies in some people.\nAsbestos is mainly a concern because it is suspected to cause cancer.\nRadon is a gas that is emitted naturally by the soil. Due to modern houses having poor ventilation, it is confined inside the house causing harm to the dwellers.\nOUTDOOR AIR POLLUTION is the pollution that occurs outside homes through automobiles, industrial emissions etc.\nMAIN AIR POLLUTANTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON HEALTH\n1) Oxides of sulphur 2) Oxides of Nitrogen 3) Suspended Particulate Matter 4) Carbon Monoxide 5) Lead 6) Benzene 7) Hydrocarbons\nHealth impacts of air pollution depend on pollutant type, its concentration in air, interaction with other pollutants, and length of exposure and individual vulnerability.\nAir Pollution has both acute and chronic effects on Human health. It has both long term and short term effects. It may range from minor irritation to most chronic respiratory problems.\nIMMEDIATE HEALTH PROBLEMS FROM AIR POLLUTION\nØ Aggravated cardiovascular and respiratory problems\nØ Burden on heart and lungs, causing them to work harder to supply the body with oxygen\nØ Damage the cells in respiratory organs\nØ Damage to deeper portions of lungs, even after symptoms of coughing or sore throat disappear\nØ Wheezing, chest pain, dry throat, headache or nausea\nØ Increased reactivity to allergens and particles\nØ Eye irritation\nØ Reduced body immunity to infection and increased fatigue\nLONG TERM EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION AS PERMANENT HEALTH PROBLEMS:\nØ Accelerated ageing of lungs and loss of lung capacity\nØ Decreased lung function\nØ Diseases like, asthma, bronchitis, emphysema and cancer\nØ Is a potential cause of human mortality\n1.

The incidence of acute respiratory\ninfection was more in highly polluted areas than less polluted areas. In New Delhi , children\nhave to bear the double the burden of diseases that have persisted for\ngenerations as well as of new diseases caused by various environmental factors. India\nAsthma: Asthma causes: 0.2% of deaths; 0.5% of NBD in\nAlthough Asthma rates are officially low in India , there is some recent\nevidence that the true prevalence is higher than previously thought.\nAssociated with urban outdoor pollution and ETS (Environmental Tobacco smoke),\ntypical solid-fuel indoor smoke exposures are much higher.\nUndoubtedly, the rates of Asthamatic patients have been increasing; it might be\ndue to increase in the environmental pollution.\n2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Today in developed countries, nearly all cases of COPD are attributable to tobacco smoking.

{"question":"What are the benefits of traditional farming methods for soil health, and what environmental risks do modern concentrated animal operations pose?","answer":"Traditional farming methods focus on nurturing the land through exchange-type fertility systems that embrace diversity and put soil at the center of health. This peace-time agriculture approach generates stored fertility and promotes resilient stewardship practices. In contrast, concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) pose significant environmental risks. Animal waste from CAFOs can contaminate surface and ground water when not properly controlled, depleting oxygen needed for aquatic life and introducing harmful bacteria like E. coli and Salmonella. Additionally, animal waste can leach into groundwater, which is particularly concerning since groundwater provides 95% of drinking water in some regions.","context":["Jack Algiere might be a modern farmer, but his spirit belongs to the pre-industrial agriculture days. Lucky for the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture, where he is the farm director, he brings this old-school wisdom and sensitivity to his work. Farming is a collective undertaking, Algiere maintains, and together we must reconnect with our food system and nourish our soil. Step One on this journey: Be curious! (Oh, and stock up on those agricultural books from the early 1900s!)\nYou were raised on a farm. What was it about that way of life that inspired you to become a farmer yourself?\nI was raised on a small homestead farm in southern Rhode Island. My parents grew their own vegetables and raised hens, pigs and milk goats. It was not my intention in my youth to become a farmer, but over the years, I realized that I’d developed confidence working in natural systems, with plants and animals, with mechanics and tools. My childhood was well rounded and I developed an early work ethic. Among my earliest memories, I remember helping with the family chores; at 12, I worked off farm, which seems now to be a very young age. Finding joy and confidence in my abilities allowed me to recognize that I was well suited to be a farmer.\nWhat do you most enjoy about having your hands in the soil?\nSoil is the lifeline. It is our connection to the Earth.\nGood soil is sensual. It allows us to learn about our environment through sight, touch and smell.\nHealthy soil is vital to growing vibrant and nutritious vegetables and fruits. Can you discuss the current state of America’s soil and the effect it’s having our food supply?\nThe US is blessed with some of the most fertile soils on the planet by volume and quality. Although our largely extractive agricultural practices over the past 200 years have certainly degraded the collective health of the soils, the fact that they are still productive is a testament to their extraordinary potential. In fact, the unprecedented use of fossil inputs and monocultural practices employed over the past 75 years have created a historic anomaly, wildly different from any other moment in the history of civilization. The optimism of those pushing technological solutions to “feed the world” blurs the fact that soil is being degraded.\nA few years ago, I read a wonderful book by the English agronomist George Stapleton that, despite being written in 1943, very simply summed up my views. Stapleton explains that there are two types of agriculture that civilizations put into practice: war-time and peace-time agriculture. War-time systems require vast resources to produce food for wars fought abroad, in times when many farmers are not on their land. This is possible only if the land has the stored fertility generated from peace-time stewardship. Peace-time agriculture is the practice of nurturing the land through an exchange-type fertility system. It embraces diversity and puts the soil at the center of health. Resilient stewardship practices limit the use of necessary inputs. After reading Stapleton, it occurred to me that we in the US have not known peace-time agriculture in our lifetimes. We have always extracted from the land to expand our strengths, and when it was just beginning to deplete, we found a short-term and optimistic solution in input technologies.\nThis is the long way around of saying that the health of the soil is the health of the food we eat. It is also the health of us. Our agricultural methods directly affect our food and lifestyle.\nWhat can be done to improve this situation?\nWe must reconnect with and be aware of our food system. It is clear that our country is not likely to become an agrarian society again, as it once was. If we develop a curiosity about our food and how it came to be, we begin to make informed choices out of our desire to enjoy eating, rather than based on fear or guilt. That is a good way to make change.\nYou recommend natural breeding as a key element in producing top-notch vegetables. What’s the difference between natural breeding and genetically-modified food?\nIn a word, stewardship. By “natural” breeding, you mean cross pollination or hybridization, the process of selecting and pollinating parent plants to get a better plant, and farmers have been practicing this for thousands of years. Over the past 150 years, plant science has been rapidly advancing these methods. Today it is quite advanced and uses lots of technology. For instance, the use of gene-mapping technology and other biotech concepts are a positive set of tools when applied by a stewardship mindset—with the intent of social inheritance. A GMO is an organism whose genome has been altered by the techniques of genetic engineering so that its DNA contains one or more genes not normally found there. The stewardship here is very different. I think the GMO issues that most people fear stem from the ownership of GMOs by agribusiness—when corporations have patents to control and own living organisms and then can design plant and animal genetics to be compatible with their chemical patents, such as the notorious link between commodity corn and glyphosate.\nI choose traditional plant breeding, and I have been pleased and surprised by the quality, flavor and beauty of all the genetic work I have engaged in over the past 20 years.\nWhat role do animals play in your vision of a thriving, sustainable farm?\nAnimals and their manures are essential to the health of our soils and agricultural systems. But current production models, such as you see in concentrated animal feeding operations or too many head of cattle on a semi-desert tract of western land, far exceed the quantity necessary for healthy balance in the ecosystem. Our consumption of meat is way too high and has both encouraged and forced the meat industry to develop unnatural input methods of raising protein at an alarming rate. Large-scale meat production has been driven by cheap resources, such as commodity grain feeding and subtherapeutic antibiotics. When you look closely at livestock’s ecological service to the land and to the soils, their numbers should be much lower to sustain the actual needs of fertility on a landscape.\nWhat are the greatest challenges facing farmers today?\nI think the greatest challenge is farmers’ ability to meet the production demands of the marketplace while reconciling with their own environmental ethics and concerns. Agriculture is intricately linked to ecosystem health; I think that most farmers understand this to be true. However, economic pressures tend to persuade farmers to compromise what they know to be true for the sake short-term gains to stay in business. As a society, we should help farmers by considering the broader set of values that underpin and are connected to agriculture.\nIs it possible for industry and a healthy agricultural system to exist side by side?\nYes – if it is an exchange-driven, non-fossil fuel-based industry.\nIf you were the Farm Director of America, what sort of across-the-board changes would you make?\nI would advise the creation of a plan that encourages and even enforces collective responsibility of our soils. We must collectively invest in the health of our soils and build enterprises upon that rather than the other way around. The future of the nation really hinges on this.\nWhat three things would you recommend for someone to get started in connecting to food and agriculture ( CSA, grow a plant, etc)?\nKnow your kitchen and how to use it. Know a farmer. Go outside.\nWhat is most pressing concern you have concerning agriculture and future of farming?\nMy concern is that we continue to look at nature as something “other” and apart from us. In doing this, we abandon a beautiful opportunity for a healthy future.\nWhat are some of your favorite books films poetry about farming and agriculture and poetics of soil and science?\nI just read “The Hidden Half of Nature” by Anne Bikle and David Montgomery and was inspired by the cross-disciplinary thinking and comprehension of the interconnectedness of soil, plant, animal and human health. It is more common for me to cite older works from before the industrial agriculture era, including Sir Albert Howard’s “An Agricultural Testament” and “The Soil and Health,” Aldo Leopold’s “A Sand County Almanac,” Rudolph Steiner’s “Agriculture,” or even Peter Henderson’s “How the Farm Pays;” they all have a particularly engrained comprehension of the connection with nature. For inspiration: Masanobu Fukuoka’s One Straw Revolution and Eliot Coleman’s The New Organic Grower.\nI adore the poetry of Mary Oliver, Wendell Berry, David Whyte and John O’Donohue. I also like Goethe. I recently read an excellent open letter by jazz greats Wayne Shorter and Herbie Hancock entitled “To the Next Generation of Artists” that resonated deeply for me.\nI enjoy documentaries like Susan Rockefeller’s “Food for Thought, Food for Life” and Deborah Koons Garcia’s “Symphony of the Soil.” My boys and I like to watch all things David Attenborough. Recently, I watched a beautiful film by Ciro Guerra called “Embrace of the Serpent” that struck a chord in relation to our connection to nature.","Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations\nConcentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) are agricultural facilities that house and feed a large number of animals (e.g., cows, hogs, chickens, or turkeys) in a confined area for 45 days or more during any 12-month period.\nImpact of CAFOs on the Environment\nCAFOs are typically areas without any vegetation, such as concrete pads or compacted dirt. If these areas are not properly designed to control runoff, animal waste can easily be carried by rain to nearby water sources. Animal waste in water is both an environmental issue and a human health issue. For instance, animal waste is high in nutrients, such as phosphorus. When it enters a stream or lake, it can deplete the oxygen required to support fish and other aquatic life. Animal waste can also contain bacteria and viruses that are harmful to humans, including E. coli and Salmonella.\nAnimal waste can also contaminate ground water if it is allowed to leach into the ground. This is an important issue to Idaho where ground water provides 95% of our drinking water.\nCAFO Regulation in Idaho\nCAFOs are required to operate in a manner that keeps animal waste from contaminating surface water or ground water. DEQ, Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA), and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) all play a role in regulating CAFOs.\nBeef Cattle Operations\nIdaho's Rules Governing Beef Cattle Animal Feeding Operations (IDAPA 02.04.15) require beef cattle animal-feeding operations to have wastewater storage and confinement facilities to control runoff and nutrient management plans to manage land application of nutrients or soil amendments. The rules are administered by ISDA and also give ISDA inspection and enforcement authority. Among ISDA's responsibilities are conducting inspections, ensuring compliance with best management practices designed to protect natural resources, providing technical assistance to beef cattle operations, conducting enforcement activities, and responding to complaints from the public.\nRules of the Department of Agriculture Governing Dairy Waste (IDAPA 02.04.14) require dairies to have an approved dairy waste system in plan and to obtain a permit or farm certification from ISDA. In addition, the rules authorize ISDA to conduct inspections and enforcement actions. The Waste Management Guidelines for Confined Feeding Operations outline a working arrangement between the agencies and Idaho dairymen to reduce duplicative inspection efforts and to provide a sound inspection program that prevents water pollution and protects Idaho's surface and ground water from dairy waste contamination.\nISDA is also the lead agency for ensuring dairy farms that are subject to Idaho's ammonia rules employ best management practices to reduce ammonia emissions. Under a memorandum of understanding between DEQ and ISDA relating to the Idaho dairy farm best management practices for the control of ammonia, ISDA is authorized to conduct inspections and provide assistance to ensure compliance with the state's ammonia rules.\nDEQ is authorized to regulate swine facilities to ensure animal waste is properly controlled so as not to adversely affect public health or the environment. New or expanding swine facilities having a one-time animal unit capacity of 2,000 or more animal units must be permitted whether or not the capacity is currently being met. No such facilities are currently located in Idaho.\nIndustrial, municipal, and other point sources of pollution that discharge wastewater directly to surface waters are required to obtain National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permits. (A point source is a source of pollution that comes from a discrete pipe or other point.) The Clean Water Act defines CAFOs as point sources; therefore, they are subject to NPDES permitting. Animal waste and wastewater can enter water bodies from spills or breaks in waste storage structures and from nonagricultural application of manure to crop land.\nIn Idaho, the NPDES permit program is administered by EPA, which means EPA is responsible for issuing and enforcing all NPDES permits in Idaho. EPA has issued a general NPDES permit for CAFOs in Idaho.\nSiting of CAFOs in Idaho\nCounties in Idaho hold the authority to regulate siting of CAFOs in the state. County ordinances regulate CAFO zoning and contain environmental-protection clauses and rules about waste removal as well.\nDairies must apply for county CAFO permits before they can open. In some counties, planning and zoning boards approve or deny the applications, and in other counties commissioners decide. The opportunity for public input before CAFOs are sited is required by Idaho statute. At a minimum, the board of county commissioners must hold at least one public hearing at which the public may comment on a proposed site. Only members of the public with their primary residence within a 1-mile radius of a proposed site may provide comment at the hearing. However, this distance may be increased by the board. The board must consider public comments when deciding whether to approve or reject a proposed site.\nThe state plays an advisory role in the siting of CAFOs. Representatives of DEQ, ISDA, and Idaho Department of Water Resources serve on Idaho's CAFO Site Advisory Team. The team reviews sites proposed for CAFOs, determines environmental risks, and submits site suitability determinations to counties."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8be73392-7a77-436a-bc32-b3040628b3be>","<urn:uuid:9f57837f-6188-482d-b982-2a3d3fb6faae>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the sweetness levels and metabolic effects compare between monk fruit and stevia-based sweeteners?","answer":"Monk fruit contains compounds called mogrosides that make it much sweeter than sugar while containing zero calories and not raising blood sugar levels. Similarly, stevia-derived rebiana is approximately 200 times sweeter than sugar and has been shown to have no effect on blood glucose. Both sweeteners are particularly suitable for people with diabetes or those managing their blood sugar levels.","context":["The Hunt for Monk Fruit: Uncovering Availability Challenges\nIf you're one of the many people on the hunt for a healthier, low-calorie sweetener, you've likely come across monk fruit. Monk fruit, also known as luo han guo, is a fruit native to regions in Southeast Asia. The fruit extract is known for its intense sweetness and lack of calories, which makes it a popular alternative to traditional sugar and artificial sweeteners. However, despite the growing demand for monk fruit, availability remains a significant challenge in the industry. Let's take a closer look at why this is the case.\nWhat is Monk Fruit?\nMonk fruit, or Siraitia grosvenorii, is a small green fruit that grows on a vine in Southeast Asia. It has been traditionally used in Chinese medicine to treat coughs and sore throats. Monk fruit contains compounds called mogrosides, which are responsible for its unique sweetness. These mogrosides are much sweeter than sugar but contain zero calories, making monk fruit a popular sugar substitute in the health and wellness industry.\nIn addition to its use as a sugar substitute, monk fruit has also been studied for its potential health benefits.

Additionally, monk fruit does not raise blood sugar levels, making it a safe option for people with diabetes or those looking to manage their blood sugar levels.\nThe History of Monk Fruit\nMonk fruit has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine. According to legend, it was named after the Buddhist monks who first cultivated the fruit over 800 years ago. The monks discovered the sweet fruit and used it as a natural remedy for coughs and sore throats. Since then, monk fruit has become a popular sweetener in China and other parts of Southeast Asia.\nThe Challenges of Sourcing Monk Fruit\nDespite the growing demand for monk fruit, availability remains a significant challenge in the industry. Monk fruit grows only in specific regions of Southeast Asia and is not widely cultivated. Additionally, the fruit has a short growing season and is delicate and difficult to transport, which makes it a costly and time-consuming process to harvest. These challenges have led to limited availability of monk fruit and difficulty meeting demand in the global market.\nA Look at the Global Monk Fruit Market\nDespite the challenges in sourcing monk fruit, the global market for monk fruit continues to grow. The United States is the largest market for monk fruit, followed by Japan and China. The market is driven by an increase in health consciousness and a demand for natural and organic sweeteners. As demand continues to grow, it is likely that the availability of monk fruit will improve as farmers look for ways to increase production and improve the supply chain.\nThe Role of China in the Monk Fruit Industry\nChina plays a significant role in the monk fruit industry, as it is the largest producer and exporter of monk fruit in the world. The fruit is native to southern China, and the country has a long history of using monk fruit as a sweetener and natural remedy. Today, China is home to several large-scale monk fruit farms that supply the global market with monk fruit extract.\nInnovations in the Cultivation and Processing of Monk Fruit\nAs demand for monk fruit continues to grow, farmers and researchers are looking for ways to improve cultivation and processing techniques. One innovation is the development of hybrid monk fruit varieties that have a higher yield and can be grown in different regions.

The use of sweeteners in people both with and without diabetes is always a great topic for discussion, and I’m glad to see that folks have done their homework and are asking questions about all of the products out there. We continue with the sweetener saga. The sweetener of the week this week is stevia (or rather, rebiana, a stevia-based sweetener).\nWhat is it? Stevia is a shrub (related to chrysanthemums) native to South America. Its leaves have been used for many years by the people of Brazil and Paraguay to sweeten a beverage called yerba mate. The substances in this herb that make it sweet are called steviol glycosides; the sweetest and best tasting of these steviol glycosides is rebaudioside A, or rebiana.\nWhere is it grown? Stevia is grown in South America, Central America, Israel, Thailand, and China. It’s highly popular in Japan, where it’s used (in place of aspartame and saccharin) to sweeten beverages, candy, and soy sauce.\nIs it safe? Stevia has been available in the US for many years as a dietary supplement, not as an “officially approved” sweetener. In the 1990’s, the FDA (along with Canada and a European Community panel) rejected the approval of stevia as a sweetener due to concerns about its safety. For example, high doses of stevia fed to rats led to decreased sperm production. Pregnant hamsters given a form of stevia had smaller offspring. And in the laboratory, stevia was believed to damage DNA, thus possibly increasing the risk of cancer.\nWhy is stevia approved as a sweetener now? Recently, two companies (Cargill and Whole Earth Sweetener, a division of Merisant) developed an extract of stevia that is 97% pure rebaudioside A and roughly 200 times sweeter than sugar. They submitted research to the FDA attesting to rebiana’s safety, and in December 2008, the FDA agreed that rebiana could be put on the GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) list for use as a general purpose sweetener. In order to get on the GRAS list, an ingredient or chemical added to foods and beverages must be deemed by qualified scientists to be safe for consumption, as evidenced through scientific procedures or through experience based on common use in food.\nYou should note that only the stevia extract rebaudioside A or rebiana has been approved for GRAS status. The use of stevia, a sweetener made from a crude preparation of dried stevia leaves, has not been approved by the FDA. Rebiana is a food-grade, high-purity extract of the stevia leaf that contains at least 97% rebaudioside A.\nIs rebiana safe? Like the other nonnutritive sweeteners, rebiana has been studied and found to be safe for people of all ages to consume. Safety data is based on 25 years of research on steviol glycosides. And if you’re curious, rebiana is not absorbed in the small intestine. It’s actually broken down by bacteria in the colon into steviol. Steviol is absorbed, turned into another substance in the liver and then excreted in the urine. Studies published in the May 2008 issue of the journal Food and Chemical Toxicology showed that very high doses of rebiana (the equivalent of a 150-pound person drinking 2,000 8-ounce servings of a rebiana-sweetened drink) had no ill effects on any organs in the body. Data also shows that rebiana has no effect on blood glucose or blood pressure.\nHowever, the consumer watchdog Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) point out that rebiana has only been tested in rats (FDA guidelines advise that testing be done on both rats and mice, and there could be some concern with DNA damage, based on earlier studies with stevia fed to rats). But despite urging from CSPI and several toxicologists from UCLA for the FDA to study rebiana further, rebiana was granted GRAS status in 2008.\nWhat’s the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for rebiana? The ADI for rebiana is 12 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day for adults and children. This translates into a 150-pound adult consuming about 30 packets of a rebiana sweetener (such as Truvia) or drinking about six 12-ounce cans of a rebiana-sweetened soda every day for life.\nMore on stevia (rebiana) sweeteners next week!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:beffae55-a268-42ef-b139-969e4b190f18>","<urn:uuid:243e3798-a51c-48af-ab04-8f63f3527bc4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the essential aspects of food safety supervision requirements in NSW, and how is compliance monitored?","answer":"In NSW, every food business must have at least one designated Food Safety Supervisor on staff at all times who must complete specific training in safe egg handling, allergen management, and cleaning/sanitizing practices. The Food Safety Supervisor certificate is valid for 5 years and must be displayed in the business, with businesses having 30 working days to renew expired certifications. Compliance monitoring is conducted through a multi-level system: the NSW Food Authority, working with NSW Health, regulates food safety across the state, while local council Health Inspectors have broad powers to enter premises without permission, request training evidence, take samples, issue fines, and even close businesses that pose serious health risks.","context":["Food Safety Inspections are one of many procedures put in place by the government to ensure that food is clean and safe for consumers. As a lot of food preparation occurs behind closed doors, customers are often unaware of how their products are made and if they are fit for consumption.\nInspections are used to ensure that food products are not contaminated in any way. Food products such as raw meat can be dangerous if not prepared properly. Additionally, without the correct cleaning and sanitising procedures in place, harmful pathogens can spread quickly.\nRegular Food Safety Inspections are an effective way for the council to protect consumers from poor food handling practices and the potential spread of food-borne illness.\nWhat can I expect from a Food Safety Inspection?\nFood Safety Inspectors, often called Environmental Health Officers (EHO's), check that good food safety practices are in place particularly around time and temperature control, cleaning and sanitising, and personal hygiene of food handlers. They will check to ensure that all kitchens are following proper food safety practices when storing, handling and preparing food and they will check that the whole restaurant is following acceptable cleaning and hygiene protocol.\nWhen inspecting a food premises, EHO’s will often check that:\n- Food is properly stored in clean, intact containers\n- No raw meat comes into contact with other foods\n- All foods are kept at proper temperatures\n- Evidence of temperature checking in the form of a log is kept\n- Cross contamination doesn’t occur by reusing food preparation tools and equipment\n- Cleaning, sanitising and hand washing are done frequently and correctly\n- All restaurant areas are clean\n- Pest control precautions are in place\n- Food labelling is accurate and sufficient\n- A Food Safety Supervisor is on staff and reasonably contactable at all times\nFor a full list of what may be checked during an inspection, food businesses are advised to contact their local council.\nHow can I prepare for a Food Safety Inspection?\nIn QLD, NSW, ACT and VIC, one of the most important factors that an EHO will address is the presence of a Food Safety Supervisor. In these states, food businesses are required by law to have a qualified Food Safety Supervisor on staff at all times and must hold the relevant documentation on the premises. Plus, all food handlers should have the skills and knowledge to handle food safely. Food businesses should:\nEnsure that the premises has a current, designated Food Safety Supervisor and that they have completed the appropriate units of competency to meet food safety training requirements. In NSW, Food Safety Supervisors are also required to hold a NSW Food Authority Certificate.\n- Ensure that all relevant certification is easily accessible and ready for evaluation. Issuing all staff with a Food Safety Card assists in making this process quick and easy.\nLook at their last hygiene and Food Safety Inspection report to check that they’ve taken all of the actions needed to meet legal requirements\nContinue to make regular, routine checks to ensure hygiene standards are being maintained by all staff\nCheck that staff are able to answer questions on food safety related to the food handling work they do\nArrange for any repairs and conduct regular maintenance of the premises and equipment\nIf a food business does not follow health standards properly, they will be cited. The restaurant may also receive a fine, which can number in the tens of thousands. These fines are designed to discourage future food safety violations.\nCommon traps to avoid\nBefore the inspection, food businesses often fail to:\n1. Clean and sanitise the food premises and equipment properly. This includes cleaning and sanitising under, behind and inside equipment and appliances, as well as cleaning grease traps, floors and storage areas\n2. Have hand washing facilities that are readily accessible, dedicated to hand washing with a supply of warm, running potable water, liquid soap and single-use paper towels\n3. Control pest issues such as cockroaches and mice so there is no evidence of infestation; cover waste containers, and protect areas from pests with fly screens etc\n4. Have a food temperature measuring device to keep high-risk food at the correct temperatures during both display and storage\n5. Cover food during storage and protect it from contamination","NSW food safety legislation\nAs a food business owner or manager, you need to be sure you comply with:\n- Federal government food safety laws\n- NSW government food safety laws\n- Local council legislation\nIf you don't comply, you risk being fined, prosecuted, or even having your business closed down.\nBelow, you'll find information on:\n- all government requirements\n- how to comply\n- what happens if you don't comply\n- who needs to do a Food Safety Supervisor Course\n- other compliance information\nNew South Wales state laws and requirements\nIn NSW, food safety requirements are set by the Food Act 2003 (NSW) and the Food Regulation 2015 (NSW).\nThese Acts require that food sold in NSW is safe and suitable for human consumption and meets all standards set out in the Food Standards Code.\nFood Safety in New South Wales is governed by the NSW Food Authority which comes under the Department of Primary Industries.\nTogether with NSW Health, the NSW Food Authority monitors food safety across the whole state. They make sure the food produced and sold in NSW meets all of the guidelines set out in the relevant state-based legislation.\nRegulating & monitoring food safety in NSW\nThe NSW Food Authority is responsible for regulating and monitoring food safety across the entire NSW food industry. This includes:\n- Food business licensing\n- Conducting food business inspections (in partnership with local councils)\n- Managing food labelling requirements\n- Specifying food safety training requirements\n- Operating the Scores on Doors scheme\n- Publishing the NSW Name & Shame List\n- Providing food recall information\nFood safety training requirements\nOne of the key requirements in the NSW Food Act relates to food safety training.\nEvery food business must have at least one designated Food Safety Supervisor on staff at all times.\nThis person is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day implementation of food safety in the workplace and must be trained in the right way.\nFood Safety Supervisor training\nAIFS has been approved by the NSW Food Authority to deliver NSW specific Food Safety Supervisor training.\nThis includes three key areas:\n- Safe egg handling\n- Allergen management\n- Cleaning and sanitising practices\nWhen you complete training with AIFS, we'll provide you with a NSW Food Safety Supervisor Certificate (sometimes known as the 'Green Certificate') on behalf of the NSW Food Authority.\nThis must be displayed in the food business.\nOnce you receive your Food Safety Supervisor qualification, the certificate is valid for 5 years from the date of issue.\nIf your certificate is due to expire you'll need to complete the NSW Recertification course to receive re-certification issued by the NSW Food Authority.\nFood businesses have 30 working days to ensure their appointed Food Safety Supervisor renews their training and obtains a new Food Safety Supervisor certification.\nFederal & local laws and requirements\nFederal government requirements\nFood Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) is responsible for regulating the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Code, the over-arching standard for food safety in Australia.\nThe Code is split into four sections:\n- Introduction and standards that apply to all food\n- Food standards\n- Food safety standards\n- Primary production standards\nFood Standards Code Governance\nThe Food Standards Code is governed by state and territory departments. In New South Wales, this is the NSW Food Authority.\nFood safety training requirements\nTraining is covered in Food Safety Practices and General Requirements Standard 3.2.2 which states that:\n‘A food business must ensure that all persons undertaking or supervising food handling operations have the necessary skills in food safety and food hygiene matters.’\nThis means that anyone who handles or prepares food, serves food, transports food or cleans food equipment and utensils must undergo food safety training if they don't already have the required skills.\nThe easiest way to make sure you’re meeting the federal requirements is by completing a food safety training course, such as the Food Handlers course provided by AIFS.\nLocal council requirements\nLocal councils are usually responsible for food business registration, monitoring compliance, providing education and advice, and taking enforcement action when needed.\nBoth state and federal requirements are enforced at a local level through Health Inspectors employed by local councils.\nHealth Inspectors play an important role in monitoring food safety. They have the authority to:\n- Enter a food business property at any time\n- Enter without permission\n- Request evidence that the correct food safety training has been performed\n- Go into any area of a food business\n- Take samples\n- Issue infringement notices (fines)\n- Close the business immediately - if it's deemed to be a serious public health risk\nWhat happens if I don't comply?\nIf a food business fails to meet these food safety training requirements, the consequences are serious.\nSuspended or cancelled licence\nFor serious offences, food business licences may be suspended or cancelled. This effectively closes your food business and prevents further trading.\nFines (penalty notices) may be issued for each offence committed. These often run into tens of thousands of dollars.\nFor serious breaches of legislation, the NSW Food Authority may prosecute employees, proprietors, managers and/or individual company directors.\nAdded to a Name & Shame list\nIn NSW, the names of food businesses that have breached food safety legislation are available to the public via a 'Name & Shame' list.\nProhibition or seizure orders\nWhen public health is at risk, your business may be forbidden to handle food and you may have food seized from your premises and destroyed.\nBrand & reputation damage\nIf a serious food safety incident occurs and is widely reported in the media, your business could struggle to recover its reputation."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fecf1f72-6489-4c00-8270-4100c91f318e>","<urn:uuid:a7a24343-a5ea-4455-9ff4-b55efbc1f057>"],"error":null}
