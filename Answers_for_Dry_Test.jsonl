It's important to consider other factors, such as the style, materials, and cultural context, when evaluating the authenticity of an Inuit sculpture."}
{"id": 1, "question": "How does SpriteKit handle animations and what are actions used for?", "passages": [{"passage": "Create 2D sprite-based games using an optimized animation system, physics simulation, and event-handling support.\n- iOS 7.0+\n- macOS 10.9+\n- tvOS 9.0+\n- watchOS 3.0+\nSpriteKit is a graphics rendering and animation infrastructure that you can use to animate arbitrary textured images, otherwise known as sprites. SpriteKit provides a traditional rendering loop that alternates between determining the contents of and rendering frames. You determine the contents of the frame and how those contents change. SpriteKit does the work to render that frame efficiently using graphics hardware. SpriteKit is optimized for applying arbitrary animations or changes to your content. This design makes SpriteKit more suitable for games and apps that require flexibility in how animations are handled.\nSprite Content is Drawn by Presenting Scenes Inside a Sprite View\nAnimation and rendering is performed by an\nSKView object. You place this view inside a window, then render content to it. Because it is a view, its contents can be combined with other views in the view hierarchy.\nContent in your game is organized into scenes, which are represented by\nSKScene objects. A scene holds sprites and other content to be rendered. A scene also implements per-frame logic and content processing. At any given time, the view presents one scene. As long as a scene is presented, its animation and per-frame logic are automatically executed.\nTo create a game or app using SpriteKit, you either subclasses the\nSKScene class or create a scene delegate to perform major game-related tasks. For example, you might create separate scene classes to display a main menu, the gameplay screen, and content displayed after the game ends. You can easily use a single\nSKView object in your window and switch between different scenes. When you switch scenes, you can use the\nSKTransition class to animate between the two scenes.\nA Node Tree Defines What Appears in a Scene\nSKScene class is a descendant of the\nSKNode class. When using SpriteKit, nodes are the fundamental building blocks for all content, with the scene object acting as the root node for a tree of node objects. The scene and its descendants determine which content is drawn and how it is rendered.\nEach node’s position is specified in the coordinate system defined by its parent. A node also applies other properties to its content and the content of its descendants.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:58254756-1664-4f28-82cc-456768d65852>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Some actions are completed in a single frame of animation, while other actions apply changes over multiple frames of animation before completing. The most common use for actions is to animate changes to the node’s properties. For example, you can create actions that move a node, scale or rotate it, or make it transparent. However, actions can also change the node tree, play sounds, or even execute custom code.\nActions are very useful, but you can also combine actions to create more complex effects. You can create groups of actions that run simultaneously or sequences where actions run sequentially. You can cause actions to automatically repeat.\nScenes can also perform custom per-frame processing. You override the methods of your scene subclass to perform additional game tasks. For example, if a node needs to be moved every frame, you might adjust its properties directly every frame instead of using an action to do so.\nSKAction reference for more information.\nAdd Physics Bodies and Joints to Simulate Physics in Your Scene\nAlthough you can control the exact position of every node in the scene, often you want these nodes to interact with each other, colliding with each other and imparting velocity changes in the process. You might also want to do things that are not handled by the action system, such as simulating gravity and other forces. To do this, you create physics bodies (\nSKPhysics) and attach them to nodes in your scene. Each physics body is defined by shape, size, mass, and other physical characteristics. The scene defines global characteristics for the physics simulation in an attached\nSKPhysics object. You use the physics world to define gravity for the entire simulation, and to define the speed of the simulation.\nWhen physics bodies are included in the scene, the scene simulates physics on those bodies. Some forces, such as friction and gravity, are applied automatically. Other forces can be applied automatically to multiple physics bodies by adding\nSKField objects to the scene. You can also directly affect a specific field body by modifying its velocity directly or by applying forces or impulses directly to it. The acceleration and velocity of each body is computed and the bodies collide with each other. Then, after the simulation is complete, the positions and rotations of the corresponding nodes are updated.\nYou have precise control over which physics effects interact with each other. For example, you can specify that a particular physics field node only affects a subset of the physics bodies in the scene.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:58254756-1664-4f28-82cc-456768d65852>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "For example, when a node is rotated, all of its descendants are rotated also. You can build a complex image using a tree of nodes and then rotate, scale, and blend the entire image by adjusting the topmost node’s properties.\nSKNode class does not draw anything, but it applies its properties to its descendants. Each kind of drawable content is represented by a distinct subclass in SpriteKit. Some other node subclasses do not draw content of their own, but modify the behavior of their descendants. For example, you can use an\nSKEffect object to apply a Core Image filter to an entire subtree in the scene. By precisely controlling the structure of the node tree, you determine the order in which nodes are rendered.\nAll node objects are responder objects, descending either from\nNSResponder, so you can subclass any node class and create new classes that accept user input. The view class automatically extends the responder chain to include the scene’s node tree.\nSKNode reference for more information.\nTextures Hold Reusable Graphical Data\nTextures, represented as\nSKTexture objects, are shared images used to render sprites. Always use textures whenever you need to apply the same image to multiple sprites. Usually you create textures by loading image files stored in your app bundle. However, SpriteKit can also create textures for you at runtime from other sources, including Core Graphics images or even by rendering a node tree into a texture.\nSpriteKit simplifies texture management by handling the lower-level code required to load textures and make them available to the graphics hardware. Texture management is automatically managed by SpriteKit. However, if your game uses a large number of images, you can improve its performance by taking control of parts of the process. Primarily, you do this by telling SpriteKit explicitly to load a texture.\nA texture atlas is a group of related textures that are used together in your game. For example, you might use a texture atlas to store all of the textures needed to animate a character or all of the tiles needed to render the background of a gameplay level. SpriteKit uses texture atlases to improve rendering performance.\nNodes Execute Actions to Animate Content\nA scene’s contents are animated using actions. Every action is an object, defined by the\nSKAction class. You tell nodes to execute actions. Then, when the scene processes frames of animation, the actions are executed.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:58254756-1664-4f28-82cc-456768d65852>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "Learn how to make iOS games using Apple’s built-in 2D game framework: Sprite Kit.

Is there a way to diagnose the low fps in playgrounds that may be due to other apps open on my computer?\nEric is correct, the playgrounds are much different and faster on iPad.

You use these callbacks to add game logic. For example, your game might destroy a node when its physics body is struck by another physics body.\nYou can also use the physics world to find physics bodies in the scene and to connect physical bodies together using a joint (\nSKPhysics). Connected bodies are simulated together based on the kind of joint.\nSee Simulating Physics for more information.\nGetting Started with SpriteKit\nSpriteKit implements content as a hierarchical tree structure of nodes. A node tree consists of a scene node as the root node and other nodes that provide content. Each frame of a scene is processed and rendered to a view. The scene executes actions and simulates physics, both of which change the contents of the tree. Then the scene is rendered efficiently using SpriteKit.\nTo start learning SpriteKit, you should look at these classes in the following order, before moving on to other classes in the framework:\nCreating Your First Scene\nSpriteKit content is placed in a window, just like other visual content. SpriteKit content is rendered by the\nSKView class. The content that an\nSKView object renders is called a scene, which is an\nSKScene object.

SpriteKit provides a traditional rendering loop that alternates between determining the contents of and rendering frames. You determine the contents of the frame and how those contents change. SpriteKit does the work to render that frame efficiently using graphics hardware. SpriteKit is optimized for applying arbitrary animations or changes to your content. This design makes SpriteKit more suitable for games and apps that require flexibility in how animations are handled.\nSprite Content is Drawn by Presenting Scenes Inside a Sprite View\nAnimation and rendering is performed by an\nSKView object. You place this view inside a window, then render content to it. Because it is a view, its contents can be combined with other views in the view hierarchy.\nContent in your game is organized into scenes, which are represented by\nSKScene objects. A scene holds sprites and other content to be rendered. A scene also implements per-frame logic and content processing. At any given time, the view presents one scene. As long as a scene is presented, its animation and per-frame logic are automatically executed.\nTo create a game or app using SpriteKit, you either subclasses the\nSKScene class or create a scene delegate to perform major game-related tasks. For example, you might create separate scene classes to display a main menu, the gameplay screen, and content displayed after the game ends. You can easily use a single\nSKView object in your window and switch between different scenes. When you switch scenes, you can use the\nSKTransition class to animate between the two scenes.\nA Node Tree Defines What Appears in a Scene\nSKScene class is a descendant of the\nSKNode class. When using SpriteKit, nodes are the fundamental building blocks for all content, with the scene object acting as the root node for a tree of node objects. The scene and its descendants determine which content is drawn and how it is rendered.\nEach node’s position is specified in the coordinate system defined by its parent. A node also applies other properties to its content and the content of its descendants.\n\nDocument 2: Some actions are completed in a single frame of animation, while other actions apply changes over multiple frames of animation before completing. The most common use for actions is to animate changes to the node’s properties. For example, you can create actions that move a node, scale or rotate it, or make it transparent. However, actions can also change the node tree, play sounds, or even execute custom code.\nActions are very useful, but you can also combine actions to create more complex effects. You can create groups of actions that run simultaneously or sequences where actions run sequentially. You can cause actions to automatically repeat.\nScenes can also perform custom per-frame processing. You override the methods of your scene subclass to perform additional game tasks. For example, if a node needs to be moved every frame, you might adjust its properties directly every frame instead of using an action to do so.\nSKAction reference for more information.\nAdd Physics Bodies and Joints to Simulate Physics in Your Scene\nAlthough you can control the exact position of every node in the scene, often you want these nodes to interact with each other, colliding with each other and imparting velocity changes in the process. You might also want to do things that are not handled by the action system, such as simulating gravity and other forces. To do this, you create physics bodies (\nSKPhysics) and attach them to nodes in your scene. Each physics body is defined by shape, size, mass, and other physical characteristics. The scene defines global characteristics for the physics simulation in an attached\nSKPhysics object. You use the physics world to define gravity for the entire simulation, and to define the speed of the simulation.\nWhen physics bodies are included in the scene, the scene simulates physics on those bodies. Some forces, such as friction and gravity, are applied automatically. Other forces can be applied automatically to multiple physics bodies by adding\nSKField objects to the scene. You can also directly affect a specific field body by modifying its velocity directly or by applying forces or impulses directly to it. The acceleration and velocity of each body is computed and the bodies collide with each other. Then, after the simulation is complete, the positions and rotations of the corresponding nodes are updated.\nYou have precise control over which physics effects interact with each other. For example, you can specify that a particular physics field node only affects a subset of the physics bodies in the scene.\n\nDocument 3: For example, when a node is rotated, all of its descendants are rotated also. You can build a complex image using a tree of nodes and then rotate, scale, and blend the entire image by adjusting the topmost node’s properties.\nSKNode class does not draw anything, but it applies its properties to its descendants. Each kind of drawable content is represented by a distinct subclass in SpriteKit. Some other node subclasses do not draw content of their own, but modify the behavior of their descendants. For example, you can use an\nSKEffect object to apply a Core Image filter to an entire subtree in the scene. By precisely controlling the structure of the node tree, you determine the order in which nodes are rendered.\nAll node objects are responder objects, descending either from\nNSResponder, so you can subclass any node class and create new classes that accept user input. The view class automatically extends the responder chain to include the scene’s node tree.\nSKNode reference for more information.\nTextures Hold Reusable Graphical Data\nTextures, represented as\nSKTexture objects, are shared images used to render sprites. Always use textures whenever you need to apply the same image to multiple sprites. Usually you create textures by loading image files stored in your app bundle. However, SpriteKit can also create textures for you at runtime from other sources, including Core Graphics images or even by rendering a node tree into a texture.\nSpriteKit simplifies texture management by handling the lower-level code required to load textures and make them available to the graphics hardware. Texture management is automatically managed by SpriteKit. However, if your game uses a large number of images, you can improve its performance by taking control of parts of the process. Primarily, you do this by telling SpriteKit explicitly to load a texture.\nA texture atlas is a group of related textures that are used together in your game. For example, you might use a texture atlas to store all of the textures needed to animate a character or all of the tiles needed to render the background of a gameplay level. SpriteKit uses texture atlases to improve rendering performance.\nNodes Execute Actions to Animate Content\nA scene’s contents are animated using actions. Every action is an object, defined by the\nSKAction class. You tell nodes to execute actions. Then, when the scene processes frames of animation, the actions are executed.\n\nDocument 4: Learn how to make iOS games using Apple’s built-in 2D game framework: Sprite Kit.

The code is quite long, and I do not know the capabilities of playgrounds. The fps are actually quite low (probably less than 15fps). Is this a limitation of playgrounds? If I send the playground book to my iPad Pro, will this limitation be similar? Is there a way to diagnose the low fps in playgrounds that may be due to other apps open on my computer?\nEric is correct, the playgrounds are much different and faster on iPad. The best solution to low fps is to move auxiliary code to the Sources folder so it only compiles once.\nOn the Mac, Xcode's \"Playgrounds\" are super useful for quick experiments but, due to their nature, terribly slow for \"real\" tasks.\nIf your code is more than a few pages long, and/or involves working with the UI, as you do with SpriteKit, the Playground may become really slow, sometimes even unresponsive.\n\"Playgrounds\" are part of Xcode and run on top of the iOS simulator - that's how they display graphics and UI in the \"Assitant Editor\". The iOS simulator is not really known to be fast either.\nOn the other hand, \"Swift Playgrounds\" on iOS is a completely different app, even if it shares a lot with its Mac cousin.\nMost importantly, it runs in iOS on the real device, with the real hardware processing, not emulation, which makes it ideal to use for SpriteKit, as Apple themselves often shows in their demos.\nI would therefore say that your code should indeed run faster/better/properly on the iPad version.\nEven if of course, I can't really know, since I don't know your code - you will probably be the one telling us later if using the iPad version made a difference.\n\nDocument 6: Sprite Kit is Apple's development framework with an Open-GL based renderer for 2-D and 2.5-D game developers. According to Apple Insider, the framework's \"built-in support for physics makes animations look real, and particle systems create essential game effects such as fire, explosions, and smoke.\" Previously, iOS developers were able to use third-party platforms for the same purposes. Now that Apple has created its own tool, it is capable of staying with and growing with Apple, rather than being acquired and taken in a different direction. Rybakov said, \"Ninety percent of the purchased applications are games, which are 2-D games in more than half of the cases, and Apple cares about its game developers.\"\n\nDocument 7: In this course you will learn the basics about the framework SpriteKit. I going to explain some theory and some practice examples so that you know a lot more about SpriteKit after this course.\nThe course is structured to help you quickly understand 2 key concepts so that you can start creating your first game straight away without any delay.\nAfter each video you will understand more and more fundamentals about developing games with SpriteKit.\nCreate your own game to impress your boy friend, girl friend or your kids <3\nIt's easy to learn with very little pieces of code.\nYou want to learn to develop own games.\nThis course is fun :)\nRequire minimum programming knowledge..\nA taste of how to create your mini game quickly with ease.\nHow to create a game for your iPhone.\nUnderstand key concepts in creating iOS games.\nHow to create different Scenes in your game.\nHow to import awesome fonts to your game.\nHow to create Animation with Sprite.\nHow to create physical contact between game characters.\nHow to create behaviours, logic, sounds and game effect.\nTask 1: Starter\nTask 2: Menu Scene\nTask 3: Game Scene\nTask 4: Game Effects\n\nDocument 8: You also decide which physics bodies can collide with each other and separately decide which interactions cause your app to be called. You use these callbacks to add game logic. For example, your game might destroy a node when its physics body is struck by another physics body.\nYou can also use the physics world to find physics bodies in the scene and to connect physical bodies together using a joint (\nSKPhysics). Connected bodies are simulated together based on the kind of joint.\nSee Simulating Physics for more information.\nGetting Started with SpriteKit\nSpriteKit implements content as a hierarchical tree structure of nodes. A node tree consists of a scene node as the root node and other nodes that provide content. Each frame of a scene is processed and rendered to a view. The scene executes actions and simulates physics, both of which change the contents of the tree. Then the scene is rendered efficiently using SpriteKit.\nTo start learning SpriteKit, you should look at these classes in the following order, before moving on to other classes in the framework:\nCreating Your First Scene\nSpriteKit content is placed in a window, just like other visual content. SpriteKit content is rendered by the\nSKView class. The content that an\nSKView object renders is called a scene, which is an\nSKScene object. Scenes participate in the responder chain and have other features that make them appropriate for games.\nBecause SpriteKit content is rendered by a view object, you can combine this view with other views in the view hierarchy. For example, you can use standard button controls and place them above your SpriteKit view. Or, you can add interactivity to sprites to implement your own buttons; the choice is up to you. Later in this example, you’ll see how to implement interactivity on the scene.\nSKView can be added as a child to a\nUIView, or you can explicitly cast your view controller’s view to to a SceneKit view either through storyboards, using Custom Class, or in code. The following listing shows how you can override a view controller’s\nview method to cast its view to an\nWith the SpriteKit view created, the next step in displaying content is to create a scene.\n\nDocument 9: I added some FX from Mercury (Particle Fx engine) to my character run animation and added a gun and bullets.\nSomeone asked me if the actions were hard coded.

Do you make stock solution with EDTA+Tris-HCl ph 8.0 or just sterile water?\ni store in 10mM Tris-HCL pH 8 at 4....it is stable like that for at least 1 month (sigma)\ni better store it in powder in the fridge\n\nQuestion: How should I store and apply 10 million nematodes that come packaged in a sponge?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "To store 10 million nematodes packaged in a sponge, keep them in the refrigerator until ready to use, as they are sensitive to temperature extremes and should be kept cool. Once removed from the refrigerator, prepare the nematodes for application by placing the sponge in a bucket with two quarts of water, then squeezing the sponge to release the nematodes into the water. Discard the sponge after the nematodes have been released.\n\nFor application, mix the nematodes with water in a sprayer or watering can, ensuring continuous mixing to prevent them from settling at the bottom. Apply the solution to the soil or plants, ideally in the evening or on a cloudy day to avoid exposure to direct sunlight, which can be harmful to the nematodes. Water the area before and after application to maintain moisture, which is crucial for the nematodes' movement and effectiveness.\n\nIt is important to note that nematodes should be used promptly after mixing with water, as they cannot be stored once diluted. Additionally, ensure the soil is not too dry or compact, as this can hinder the nematodes' ability to search for hosts.\n\nIn summary, store nematodes in the refrigerator, prepare them by soaking the sponge in water, apply them in the evening or on a cloudy day, and maintain soil moisture for optimal effectiveness."}

UNESCO calls it the symbol of World Heritage. The world calls it the Athenian Acropolis!\nThe history of the Acropolis of Athens is long, with moments when democracy philosophy and art flourished, leading to its creation. Then there were the times when its best standing pieces were removed and shipped away from the city, dividing the monument in two. Today, the international community wants to reunite all of the Acropolis sculptures in Athens and restore both its physicality and meaning.\nThe Acropolis, and the Parthenon in particular, is the most characteristic monument of the ancient Greek civilisation. It continues to stand as a symbol in many ways: it is the symbol of democracy and the Greek civilisation. It also symbolises the beginning of the Western civilisation and stands as the icon of European culture. The Parthenon was dedicated to Athena Parthenos, the patron goddess of the city of Athens and goddess of wisdom. It was built under the instructions of Pericles, the political leader of Athens in the 5th century BC. The Parthenon was constructed between 447 and 438 BC and its sculptural decoration was completed in 432 BC. In 1987 it was inscribed as a World Heritage Site (UNESCO, 1987). Uniquely, capturing the gravity of the Athenian Acropolis as a symbol, UNESCO recognises that “[…] the Acropolis, the site of four of the greatest masterpieces of classical Greek art – the Parthenon, the Propylaea, the Erechtheum and the Temple of Athena Nike – can be seen as symbolizing the idea of world heritage” (UNESCO, 2006).\nDespite the unique symbolic and cultural value of the monument, the issue of the removal of the sculptures from the Athenian Acropolis by Elgin continues to shadow their history. Today, more than half of the Parthenon sculptures are in the British Museum in London and their return to Athens, for their display in the Acropolis Museum together with the other originals, is a cultural issue awaiting to be settled.\nIt is recommended that you start your reading about the Parthenon and the Acropolis of Athens at the Acropolis of Athens page of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:afada2a6-5dc7-48c7-a636-332ff2d62005>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Athens (//; Modern Greek: Αθήνα, Athína; IPA: [aˈθina]; Katharevousa: Ἀθῆναι, Athinai; Ancient Greek: Ἀθῆναι, Athēnai) is the capital and largest city of Greece.

Uniquely, capturing the gravity of the Athenian Acropolis as a symbol, UNESCO recognises that “[…] the Acropolis, the site of four of the greatest masterpieces of classical Greek art – the Parthenon, the Propylaea, the Erechtheum and the Temple of Athena Nike – can be seen as symbolizing the idea of world heritage” (UNESCO, 2006).\nDespite the unique symbolic and cultural value of the monument, the issue of the removal of the sculptures from the Athenian Acropolis by Elgin continues to shadow their history. Today, more than half of the Parthenon sculptures are in the British Museum in London and their return to Athens, for their display in the Acropolis Museum together with the other originals, is a cultural issue awaiting to be settled.\nIt is recommended that you start your reading about the Parthenon and the Acropolis of Athens at the Acropolis of Athens page of the Hellenic Ministry of Culture.\n\nDocument 2: Athens (//; Modern Greek: Αθήνα, Athína; IPA: [aˈθina]; Katharevousa: Ἀθῆναι, Athinai; Ancient Greek: Ἀθῆναι, Athēnai) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning around 3,400 years. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely due to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC in later centuries on the rest of the then known European continent. Today a cosmopolitan metropolis, modern Athens is central to economic, financial, industrial, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2008, Athens was ranked the world's 32nd richest city by purchasing power and the 25th most expensive in a UBS study.\nThe city of Athens has a population of 655,780 (796,442 back in 2004) within its administrative limits and a land area of 39 km2 (15 sq mi). The urban area of Athens (Greater Athens and Greater Piraeus) extends beyond the administrative municipal city limits, with a population of 3,074,160 (in 2011),over an area of 412 km2 (159 sq mi). According to Eurostat, the Athens Larger Urban Zone (LUZ) is the 7th most populous LUZ in the European Union (the 4th most populous capital city of the EU) with a population of 4,013,368 (in 2004). Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland.\nThe heritage of the classical era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western civilization. The city also retains Roman and Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller number of Ottoman monuments.\nAthens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery.\n\nDocument 3: In our last post, we celebrated the recent addition of ancient Ephesus to the UNESCO World Heritage List by describing the various sites of such distinction that we visit on our tours and cruises of Turkey.\nThe next post - incidentally - will be about Italy, where the Arab-Norman heritage of Palermo and surroundings received the same honour this year.\nBut, moving from East to West, there's some ground to cover first, some seas to cross and a whole country to deal with: Greece. The \"cradle of western civilisation\" is home to a host of immensely significant sites, places of importance, interest, beauty and impact. Not all of them reflect the civilisation we call Classical Greece - they range from prehistoric citadels via Classical temples to Byzantine monasteries and beyond.\nWORLD HERITAGE SITES ON OUR TOURS AND CRUISES IN GREECE\nThe most obvious image of Greece and one of the most famous architectural monuments in the world, the Acropolis is the sacred rock in the heart of the city, ancient and modern. Settled since prehistory, it became the citadel of a Bronze Age realm and later the formal religious centre of the Classical city. Its redesign, masterminded by the political leader Perikles and the artist Pheidias, began in 450s BC, when Athens was at the height of her wealth and power. The main monuments than built include the awesome Propylaia, the ornate Temple of Nike, the highly original Erechtheion and – of course – the mighty Parthenon. A visit to the Acropolis should also include the shrines and sanctuaries along its slopes – and the state-of-the-art Acropolis Museum with its wonderful collections.\nThe Acropolis, in its full historical and urban context, is a central highlight on our Athens tour, and can easily be visited before or after our Peloponnese tour, which starts and ends in Athens. Guests on both tours could also easily add a visit to the UNESCO-listed monasteries at Daphni or Osios Loukas – or even a day trip to the Archaeological site of Delphi, the famous oracular sanctuary to Apollo, another World Heritage site.\nThe Peloponnese, the legendary and historical peninsula that makes up the southern part of the Greek Mainland, is an area of immense historical and cultural wealth.\n\nDocument 4: - 02 Dec - 08 Dec, 2023\nTOP 7 THINGS TO DO IN ATHENS\n- 18 Mar - 24 Mar, 2023\n- Travel Diaries\nThose who wish to take in all that Europe has to offer will find Athens to be a wonderland. Every part of this city has a promise of something fresh and intriguing, from its breathtaking history and architecture to its breathtaking scenery and delectable cuisine.\nOne of the oldest cities in the world is Athens, the capital of Greece. Ancient ruins and important historical sites can be found everywhere. Prepare to be mesmerised by magnificent structures like the Parthenon and Acropolis. Here are few things you should do in Athens:\nVisit The Acropolis Of Athens\nThe Acropolis is listed as one of the top attractions in all of Greece and as a must-visit site if you want to learn more about the magnificent Greek culture in every travel guide about Athens. This historic fortress, which is perched atop a hill overlooking the city, has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. In order to worship the goddess Athena, the Acropolis of Athens was built in the fifth century BC. Every year, millions of people flock here to see the Parthenon, the Temple of Athena Nike, and the Odeon of Herodes Atticus, three significant ancient structures. The Erechtheion temple, the Theatre of Dionysus from the sixth century, and the Propylaea, the imposing entrance to the Acropolis, are all nearby. The National Archaeological Museum and The Acropolis Museum are two places to go to witness some of the most important antiquity from Greece. Remember that a walking tour of the Acropolis Hill takes about two to three hours, so you should dress appropriately. You should also carry sunscreen and a hat because there is no cover from the sun. To avoid standing in large lines, you can also buy your ticket online in advance.\nExplore The Benaki Museum Of Athens\nThe Benakis family started the Benaki Museum in 1931. It contains a substantial collection of Mycenaean, Cycladic, and Minoan artwork. There include displays of toys and games, Byzantine artefacts, and Neo-Hellenistic artwork. A sizeable collection of modernistic artwork is also present, which consists of religious relics, clothing, woodwork paintings, and jewellery.\n\nDocument 5: Athens is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world’s oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennium BC. A center for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato’s Academy and Aristotle’s Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. Athens is the 6th most populous capital city of the EU with a population of 3.8 million people. Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland. ccessible transportation in Athens is as good or better than any major city in Europe.\nThe heritage of the classical era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western civilization. The city also retains Roman and Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller number of Ottoman monuments. Athens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery.\nAttractions and Opportunities\nAll of the subway stations in Athens have elevators. Wheelchair users and people with other disabilities have multiple options for accessible transportation.\nG & K Taxis are the first wheelchair accessible taxi service based in Athens, providing transfers, tours and chauffeurs for individuals and groups. They provide a safe and reliable way to move throughout Athens in the comfort of your own wheelchair.\n\nDocument 6: The Acropolis hill, also called the «Sacred Rock» of Athens, is the most important site of the city and constitutes one of the most recognizable monuments of the world. It is the most significant reference point of ancient Greek culture, as well as the symbol of the city of Athens itself as it represent the apogee of artistic development in the 5th century BC.\nA visit to Athens is not complete without visiting the Acropolis, hundreds of tourists each day accordingly make the pilgrimage. Acropolis from Filopappou Hill.\nAcropolis at dusk from Lycabettus Hill.Acropolis fromAcropolis of Athens is an ancient citadel located on a high rocky outcrop above the city of Athens and contains the remains of several ancient buildings of great architectural and historic significance, the most famous being the Parthenon.\nAlthough there are many other acropoleis in Greece, the significance of the Acropolis of Athens is such that it is commonly known as «The Acropolis» withoutthere is evidence that the hill was inhabited as far back as the fourth millennium BC, it was Pericles (c. 495 – 429 BC) in the fifth century BC who coordinated the construction of the site’s most important buildings including the Parthenon, the Propylaia, the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Nike.\nThe Parthenon and the other buildings were seriously damaged during the 1687 siege by the Venetians in the Morean War when the Parthenon was being used for gunpowder storage and was hit by a cannonball.\nThe Acropolis was formally proclaimed as the preeminent monument on the European Cultural Heritage list of monuments on 26 March 2007.\n|From acropolis to Pireaus, Athens, Greece.|\n|Amphitheater in Acropolis, Athens, Greece.|\n|The Caryatid Porch of the Erechtheion, Acropolis, Athens, Greece.|\n|Erechtheum, Acropolis of Athens, Greece.|\n|The Parthenon on the top of the Acropolis Hill, Athens, Greece.|\n|The Propylaea of the Acropolis from inside, Athens, Greece.|\nOn the Acropolis\nThe Parthenon: The largest temple on the Acropolis, originally dedicated to the goddess of the city, Athena.

The State Party of a country, which in the case of the UK is the Government, compiles a tentative list of sites to be considered for inscription. They are then evaluated by either ICOMOS (International Council of Monuments and Sites) for cultural sites and / or IUCN (World Conservation Union) for natural sites. The sites are then presented to the World Heritage Committee who make the final decision.\nThe nomination process involves the production of documents to demonstrate that the property is of “Outstanding Universal Value”, and a management plan to show that mechanisms are in place for the future protection and conservation of the site.\nFor further information:\nWhat is the Purpose?\nThe cultural heritage and the natural heritage are among the priceless and irreplaceable possessions, not only of each nation, but also of mankind as a whole. The loss, through deterioration or disappearance, of any of these most prized possessions constitutes an impoverishment of the heritage of all the peoples in the world. Parts of that heritage, because of their exceptional qualities, can be considered to be of outstanding universal value and as such worthy of special protection against the dangers, which increasingly threaten them.\nThe purpose is to identify the sites worthy of the status of World Heritage Sites and then ensure their protection and conservation.\nWhat are the criteria for a site becoming a World Heritage Site?\n\nDocument 8: The Acropolis of Athens, Greece, a monument of great architectural and historic significance, came in second after the Angkor site in Cambodia on a list composed recently by the American news network CNN about the most beautiful world heritage sites.\nCNN made this list after the announcement that two people undertook the purchase of the most expensive vacation ever. The men, a Chinese student and an Italian businessman, will visit all 962 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in two years and the total cost of this luxury expedition, organized by the website VeryFirstTo.com, will surpass $1.5 million.\nThe survey listed the top 20 sites in the world. Of the Acropolis, CNN wrote: “The ancient Greek monument is enchanting whether someone walks on the rock or he admires it from a distance”.\nAccording to CNN the most beautiful World Heritage Sites are the following:\n1.

The urban area of Athens (Greater Athens and Greater Piraeus) extends beyond its administrative municipal city limits, with a population of 3,090,508 (in 2011) over an area of 412 km2 (159 sq mi). According to Eurostat in 2011, the functional urban area (FUA) of Athens was the 9th most populous FUA in the European Union (the 6th most populous capital city of the EU), with a population of 3.8 million people. Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland.The heritage of the classical era is still evident in the city, represented by ancient monuments and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon, considered a key landmark of early Western civilization. The city also retains Roman and Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller number of Ottoman monuments.Athens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery. Landmarks of the modern era, dating back to the establishment of Athens as the capital of the independent Greek state in 1834, include the Hellenic Parliament and the so-called \"architectural trilogy of Athens\", consisting of the National Library of Greece, the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens and the Academy of Athens. Athens is also home to several museums and cultural institutions, such as the National Archeological Museum, featuring the world's largest collection of ancient Greek antiquities, the Acropolis Museum, the Museum of Cycladic Art, the Benaki Museum and the Byzantine and Christian Museum. Athens was the host city of the first modern-day Olympic Games in 1896, and 108 years later it welcomed home the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n\nDocument 10: The aim of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention is to protect valuable cultural and natural sites around the world. Verla was named a World Heritage site due to its status as a unique and culturally and historically significant example of an industrial settlement from the turn of the 20th century.\nThe UNESCO World Heritage Convention\nUNESCO, founded in 1945, is an educational, scientific and cultural organisation and a specialised agency of the United Nations. Its purpose is to promote peace, reduce poverty and contribute to sustainable development and intercultural dialogue by promoting cooperation between nations through the use of science, education and culture.\nThe UNESCO World Heritage Convention is one of the most well-known international conventions. The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World’s Cultural and Natural Heritage was adopted in 1972. Finland ratified the convention in 1987. The purpose of the convention is to safeguard the preservation of valuable cultural and environmental heritage worldwide and protect it from destruction and decay. Around the world, 191 nations have committed to honouring the convention. As of July 2017, there are World Heritage sites in 167 different countries.\nThe prime catalyst for the World Heritage Convention was a major international effort in 1959–1968 to rescue the Abu Simbel temples in Egypt, which were threatened by the rising waters of the Nile due to the construction of a dam. The rescue operation awakened a strong international urge to protect the world’s irreplaceable cultural heritage.\nThe World Heritage Convention is based on a concern for safeguarding the world’s endangered cultural and environmental heritage for future generations. Its mission is to demonstrate the value of the world’s most significant cultural heritage sites and to preserve them through international cooperation. World Heritage is a matter of the common cultural and environmental heritage of the entire human race.\nCriteria for Cultural and Natural Heritage Sites\nIn order to be included in the World Heritage List, a cultural heritage site must be regarded as a masterpiece of human creativity or bear an exceptional testimony as to an existing or already extinct culture. For example, the site can be a building type that represents a significant historical era or illustrates the traditional settlements of a certain culture. It can also be associated with events, living traditions, ideologies, religions, beliefs or artistic and written works.\nAn environmental heritage site, on the other hand, could reveal something about an important developmental phase in the history of the Earth itself or be an example of ongoing ecological or biological change.\n\nDocument 11: Athens, city of gods\nDiving in a permanent sunbathing, the beautiful city of Athens keeps shining, dominated by a plethora of archaeological remains that crossed the ages. Founded in 800 BC by the goddess Athena or by the hero Theseus (there are several different legends), the capital of Greece is today one of the oldest cities in the world. It has a stunning historic cityscape listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and jealously preserved by its inhabitants.\nA democratic and religious capital\nThe political and cultural cradle of the Mediterranean, Athens also founded the first republic of the history and saw the birth of many philosophers – such as Plato, Socrates and Aristotle (who later wrote the Athenians’ constitution) whose precepts continue to influence our Contemporary societies. At the same time, most Athenians also had religious functions for many centuries – the gods being an integral part of their lives.\nThe monuments of Athens: prowess of men at gods’ service\nIn order to honor the gods, many temples and other religious buildings were built by the Athenians. The Acropolis is one of them. This high rocky plateau surrounded by buttresses, was both a citadel and a religious sanctuary dedicated to the goddess Athena. The Athenians built many other temples, including the Parthenon, the Erechtheum and the temple of Athena Nike, as well as other spectacular monuments such as the Propylaea, the theater of Dionysus and the odeon of Herod Atticus. The Acropolis is today one of the most impressive men’s achievements.\nAnother place not to be missed is the Agora where the Athenians use to meet to debate laws and ideas. On the same site, the temple of the god Hephaestus (5th century) is one of the oldest witnesses of ancient Athens.\nMany other vestiges in Athens shows the importance of the Gods during Antiquity. Our team of professional guides has set up tailor-made tours to help you discover these architects and their secrets.\n\nDocument 12: You can also start from The Review of the Seizure of the Parthenon sculptures, or read The Memorandum of the Greek Government for The Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles.

The Greek capital has a population of 3.81 million (in 2011).\nA bustling and cosmopolitan metropolis, Athens is central to economic, financial, industrial, political and cultural life in Greece. It is rapidly becoming a leading business centre in the European Union.\nAthens is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely due to the impact of its cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC on the rest of the, then known, European continent. The heritage of the classical era is still evident in the city, represented by a number of ancient monuments and works of art, the most famous of all being the Parthenon on the Acropolis, widely considered a key landmark of early Western civilization. The city also retains a vast variety of Roman and Byzantine monuments, as well as a smaller number of remaining Ottoman monuments projecting the city's long history across the centuries. Landmarks of the modern era are also present, dating back to 1830 (the establishment of the independent Greek state), and taking in the Greek Parliament (19th century) and the Athens Trilogy (Library, University, and Academy).\nThe establishment of Athens as a city dates back to mythological times. The city’s history is still evident throughout Athens in the form of many Ancient, Roman, Byzantine and modern monuments. Today’s capital integrates the ancient and medieval history into the contemporary era. Monuments can be found all around the city center, side by side with contemporary constructions such as buildings, roads and train stations.\nThe Parthenon, a monument that constitutes the symbol of Greece worldwide, has been standing on the “sacred rock” of Athens, the Acropolis, for thousands of years. The Parthenon along with the other monuments of the Acropolis, are all excellent pieces of art, reflecting the Classical period and the Golden Age of ancient Athens in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C.\nThe Acropolis Museum\nDesigned by Bernard Tchumi in collaboration with Michalis Photiadis; the sparkling new museum, since its opening in June 2009, has already become the city’s top attraction and is expected to become one of the most visited and “must see” museums worldwide.\n\nDocument 14: Walking past the Acropolis, Parthenon, Temple of Olympian Zeus and the ancient Angora I realized how similar Athens is to Rome. I had been to Rome three years ago and the similarities between the two in terms of architecture is obvious. After all, the Roman empire was influenced by the classical Greek culture. The ruins in Athens are 7000 years old.\nGreece is a cradle of western civilization. Everywhere you turn, you will find ruins that are thousands of years old. If you love art, history or archeology, you'll love Greece.\nAt the Acropolis I soaked up on the gentle peace and the ancientness of the place which has seen life inhabited as far as the 4th millenium BC. From here you can look out at the sea (so blue and you now know why it's called the Aegean Sea) and down on the city, with the ancient Agora and Plaka hugging it's foothill. Acropolis means \"city on a hill\". As you look at this architectural wonder you are struck by the scale of this place steeped in history as you walk into the foot steps of the ancient Greeks . It's location definitely makes it the crowning glory of Athens. It stands above the city of Athens, an ancient citadel with some of the most significant monuments of global civilization. You can visit the holy places of Plato, Pericles and Aristotle, where democracy and philosophy were born.\nParthenon - It is the central and the largest of the Acropolis temples and is dedicated to Athena, the patron of the city. There are a total of 50 columns still remaining. It is now a UNESCO world heritage site. Since it has been built, the Parthenon has been used as a temple, a church, as a fortress and a gun powder storage facility. It was destroyed in a fire, in an explosion in 1687 and then looted by invaders. Standing in front of this monument I felt transported into ancient Greece. The feeling was very surreal.\nTemple of Dionysos - is on the southern slope of the Acropolis and a site of two performance venues. The wide semi circle of audience seats is cut out of natural rocks and can seat about 5500 people.\n\nQuestion: What makes UNESCO consider the Acropolis of Athens particularly significant as a World Heritage Site?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "The Acropolis of Athens is a World Heritage Site recognized by UNESCO for its profound significance in the realms of architecture, history, and the birth of Western democracy. It stands as a testament to the pinnacle of ancient Greek civilization, showcasing masterpieces of classical Greek art and architecture. The Parthenon, Propylaia, Erechtheum, and the Temple of Athena Nike are emblematic of the era's architectural and artistic achievements, representing the zenith of Doric and Ionic styles.\n\nBeyond its architectural splendor, the Acropolis played a crucial role in the development of Western democracy. As the heart of ancient Athens, it was the birthplace of democratic principles, where citizens participated in decision-making processes, laying the groundwork for modern democratic systems. This site not only housed temples and structures that symbolized the religious and cultural beliefs of the ancient Greeks but also served as a strategic stronghold, offering defense for the city.\n\nThe Acropolis's enduring influence on Western civilization is evident in its continued relevance as a symbol of democracy, philosophy, and architectural innovation. The principles of democracy, philosophy, and the arts that originated in ancient Greece have shaped the course of Western civilization, influencing governance, art, and architecture.\n\nIn summary, the Acropolis's significance is multifaceted, encompassing its role in the development of Western democracy, its representation of cultural and artistic achievements, and its strategic importance. Its recognition as a World Heritage Site underscores its importance as a testament to human heritage and the enduring impact of ancient Greek civilization."}

It can’t be created or destroyed, but it can move between objects and change forms. The energy of motion of a moving object is called kinetic energy, and is given by the equation\nKE = 0.5m(v^2)\nWhere m is the object’s mass, and v is the object’s velocity.\nAnother form of energy is called potential energy which is the energy an object has from being at a spot in a field where it would rather not be. When you lift an object up from the ground, the energy you put into lifting it becomes gravitational potential energy, given by PE = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 meters per second), and h is height. Pulling opposite poles of magnets apart or pushing identical poles close together also produces its own kind of potential energy.\nWhen you stop holding up an object, it starts to fall, and that gravitational potential energy transforms into kinetic energy (when it actually hits the ground, the energy gets dispersed in a complicated mess of heat and mechanical deformation).\nWhereas we could solve this problem using kinematic equations, conservation of energy makes these kind of problems much easier.\nThe total energy isn’t going to change from start to finish. It will just move entirely from potential to kinetic. At the start, it’s all potential, given by mgh.\n(5)(9.8)(200) = 9800 J That’s joules by the way, the basic unit of energy.\nThis is all going to become kinetic energy, so:\n9800 = 0.5m(v^2)\n9800 = 0.5(5)(v^2)\n3920 = (v^2)\nsqrt(3920) = v = 62.6 m/s\nThis is an incredibly powerful trick. Using this method, we could even find how fast the rock is moving at any particular height just by finding the potential at that height, subtracting it from the starting total, and setting the leftover equal to kinetic energy.\nAbout The Author\n|Physics Guru And General Math And Science Enthusia|\n|I\\'ve always had a passion for learning science and then turning around and teaching it to anyone who will listen.

Energy is the ability to bring about change or to do work. Thermodynamics is the study of energy.\nFirst Law of Thermodynamics: Energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The total amount of energy and matter in the Universe remains constant, merely changing from one form to another. The First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation) states that energy is always conserved, it cannot be created or destroyed. In essence, energy can be converted from one form into another. Click here for another page (developed by Dr. John Pratte, Clayton State Univ., GA) covering thermodynamics.\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics states that \"in all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves the system, the potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the initial state.\" This is also commonly referred to as entropy. A watchspring-driven watch will run until the potential energy in the spring is converted, and not again until energy is reapplied to the spring to rewind it. A car that has run out of gas will not run again until you walk 10 miles to a gas station and refuel the car. Once the potential energy locked in carbohydrates is converted into kinetic energy (energy in use or motion), the organism will get no more until energy is input again. In the process of energy transfer, some energy will dissipate as heat. Entropy is a measure of disorder: cells are NOT disordered and so have low entropy. The flow of energy maintains order and life. Entropy wins when organisms cease to take in energy and die.\nPotential energy, as the name implies, is energy that has not yet been used, thus the term potential. Kinetic energy is energy in use (or motion). A tank of gasoline has a certain potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy by the engine. When the potential is used up, you're outta gas! Batteries, when new or recharged, have a certain potential.

It can’t be created or destroyed, but it can move between objects and change forms. The energy of motion of a moving object is called kinetic energy, and is given by the equation\nKE = 0.5m(v^2)\nWhere m is the object’s mass, and v is the object’s velocity.\nAnother form of energy is called potential energy which is the energy an object has from being at a spot in a field where it would rather not be. When you lift an object up from the ground, the energy you put into lifting it becomes gravitational potential energy, given by PE = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity (9.8 meters per second), and h is height. Pulling opposite poles of magnets apart or pushing identical poles close together also produces its own kind of potential energy.\nWhen you stop holding up an object, it starts to fall, and that gravitational potential energy transforms into kinetic energy (when it actually hits the ground, the energy gets dispersed in a complicated mess of heat and mechanical deformation).\nWhereas we could solve this problem using kinematic equations, conservation of energy makes these kind of problems much easier.\nThe total energy isn’t going to change from start to finish. It will just move entirely from potential to kinetic. At the start, it’s all potential, given by mgh.\n(5)(9.8)(200) = 9800 J That’s joules by the way, the basic unit of energy.\nThis is all going to become kinetic energy, so:\n9800 = 0.5m(v^2)\n9800 = 0.5(5)(v^2)\n3920 = (v^2)\nsqrt(3920) = v = 62.6 m/s\nThis is an incredibly powerful trick. Using this method, we could even find how fast the rock is moving at any particular height just by finding the potential at that height, subtracting it from the starting total, and setting the leftover equal to kinetic energy.\nAbout The Author\n|Physics Guru And General Math And Science Enthusia|\n|I\\'ve always had a passion for learning science and then turning around and teaching it to anyone who will listen.

For example, a demolition ball stores energy when it is held high without activity. Do you know that working of a bow and arrow employs the first law of thermodynamics, which says that ‘energy can neither be created nor be destroyed; it can only be transferred from one form to another’? Hence, snow starts moving down the mountain swiftly. The planets revolving around the sun, the atoms spinning around the nucleus, a soccer ball that is moving or even a fish swimming are some of the examples of systems that possess mechanical energy. Like a rock about to fall off a precipice, a fruit in a tree has the ability to detach at any time due to the attraction exerted by gravitational forces on Earth. This is it for now. They include watching television, washing clothes, heating and lighting the home, taking a shower, working from home on your laptop or computer, running appliances and cooking. Dryer 3. The natural world has used the sun’s energy since the beginning of time, and while there has been lots of discussion about this, the truth is that the sun is both a problem and a solution.

Energy is the ability to bring about change or to do work. Thermodynamics is the study of energy.\nFirst Law of Thermodynamics: Energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed. The total amount of energy and matter in the Universe remains constant, merely changing from one form to another. The First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation) states that energy is always conserved, it cannot be created or destroyed. In essence, energy can be converted from one form into another. Click here for another page (developed by Dr. John Pratte, Clayton State Univ., GA) covering thermodynamics.\nThe Second Law of Thermodynamics states that \"in all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves the system, the potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the initial state.\" This is also commonly referred to as entropy. A watchspring-driven watch will run until the potential energy in the spring is converted, and not again until energy is reapplied to the spring to rewind it. A car that has run out of gas will not run again until you walk 10 miles to a gas station and refuel the car. Once the potential energy locked in carbohydrates is converted into kinetic energy (energy in use or motion), the organism will get no more until energy is input again. In the process of energy transfer, some energy will dissipate as heat. Entropy is a measure of disorder: cells are NOT disordered and so have low entropy. The flow of energy maintains order and life. Entropy wins when organisms cease to take in energy and die.\nPotential energy, as the name implies, is energy that has not yet been used, thus the term potential. Kinetic energy is energy in use (or motion). A tank of gasoline has a certain potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy by the engine. When the potential is used up, you're outta gas! Batteries, when new or recharged, have a certain potential. When placed into a tape recorder and played at loud volume (the only settings for such things), the potential in the batteries is transformed into kinetic energy to drive the speakers. When the potential energy is all used up, the batteries are dead. In the case of rechargeable batteries, their potential is reelevated or restored.\n\nDocument 6: BCA Semester 1: Physics - Forms of EnergyQ & A\nQ(2013): (a) State Law of Conservation of Energy.\n(b) Write the names of different forms of energy.\nLaw of Conservation of Energy: This law states that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed, but can change form.

This simply means that energy may be transformed from one form to another. For example in loudspeakers, electric bells the electrical energy is converted into sound energy while in electromagnet electrical energy is converted into magnetic energy and for a ball falling on earth, the mechanical energy is converted into heat energy etc.\nEinstein’s Mass Energy Equivalence :\nAccording to Einstein neither mass nor energy of the universe is conserved separately: but mass and energy are interconvertible according to relation\nThis relation is called Einstein’s mass energy equivalence. Accordingly,\n“Total (mass + energy) of universe is conserved”. This is the most general law of conservation of energy.\nAccording to mass energy equivalence the body of mass at rest has rest energy therefore the kinetic energy of the body\nWhere m is the mass of the body moving with speed v given by\nCoefficient of Restitution :\nWhen the two bodies collide directly, then the ratio of relative velocity after collision to the relative velocity before collision is a fixed quantity. The quantity\nis called the coefficient of restitution. Here u1, U2 are initial velocities and are final velocities of two bodies. The value of e lies between O and l. For a perfectly elastic collision e = 1 and for a perfectly inelastic collision e = 0.\nIf a body falls freely from a height H on a floor and bounces back to a height h. Then initial velocity u is given by,\nand the final velocity v is given by\nElastic and Inelastic Collisions :\nElastic collisions :\nA collision is said to be elastic if the total kinetic energy before and collision remains the same.\n\nDocument 11: Kinetic energy, also known as the energy of motion, is all around us in different forms. Without it, there would be no light, heat, sound, or movement. Only when the other major type of energy, potential energy, converts to kinetic energy are we able to see, hear, and move about. Kinetic energy even works at the molecular level. Vibrating molecules produce heat, and subatomic particles called electrons can flow together to create electricity. From the basic movement of atoms producing heat to a car screeching to a stop, kinetic energy affects our everyday lives.\n\nDocument 12: Why is matter not being created at the present time, nor being destroyed?\nMatter is being created and destroyed now. For example, a high energy X-ray can collide with the nucleus of an atom and disappear and two particles, an electron and an anti-electron (a.k.a. positron), will appear in its place. So extra matter is being produced from no matter. The important thing is that the amount of total energy stays the same, but the energy can change its form from electromagnetic radiation (the X-ray) to matter (the electron and positron). Also, an electron and positron can collide with and annihilate each other, producing X-rays.\nMac Mestayer, Staff Scientist (Other answers by Mac Mestayer)\n\nDocument 13: I am a bit confused about the definition of elastic collision. What i have studied is, elastic collision is one in which the kinetic energy is conserved. Now, some books also say that elastic collision is one in which both momentum and kinetic energy is conserved. But, is it true that momentum is always conserved in an elastic collision. I have an example where in the collision is elastic but the momentum is still not conserved. A rod of mass M is hanging from the hinge of the ceiling. Now a point mass 'm' collides elastically with the rod. Surely the energy is conserved. But is the momentum conserved?\n\nDocument 14: Kinetic energy is motion of waves, electrons, atoms, molecules, substances and objects. The types of kinetic energy are:\n- Radiant energy is electromagnetic energy that travels in transverse waves (light, x-rays, gamma and radio waves).\n- Thermal energy, or heat, is the energy that comes from the movement of atoms and molecules in a substance (geothermal energy of the earth).\n- Motion energy is energy stored in the movement of objects. The faster they move, the more energy is stored (wind).\n- Sound is the movement of energy through substances in compression/rarefaction waves. Sound is produced when a force causes an object or substance to vibrate.\n- Electrical energy is delivered by tiny charged particles called electrons, typically moving through a wire (lightning).\n\nDocument 15: View Single Post\nMar5-12, 12:08 PM\nWhat is energy?\nIs it more of a bookeeping device for ultimately calculating the trajectory of the particle?\nYes, energy is just a numerical value, which happens to be conserved. And that makes it useful for calculating stuff. Feynman on energy:\n\nQuestion: Can energy be created or destroyed during motion?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only be transformed from one form to another. This principle is known as the Law of Conservation of Energy, a fundamental concept in physics. In the context of motion, kinetic energy (the energy of motion) and potential energy (the energy stored due to an object's position or configuration) are two primary forms of energy that can be converted into one another. For example, when an object falls, its potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.\n\nHowever, the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant. This means that while energy can change forms, such as from potential to kinetic, the overall energy within the system does not increase or decrease. Therefore, during motion, energy can change forms but cannot be created or destroyed. This principle underscores the fundamental nature of energy conservation in physics."}

At just 19 years old, this prodigious talent has already accomplished what many only dream of.\n\nDocument 2: In the press conference on the eve of Toronto, the young Spanish tennis player made important statements\nCarlos Alcaraz not only confirmed himself as number one in the world, but he beat the Serbian champion Novak Djokovic, beating him in a historical and incredible Wimbledon final.The Serb was the big favourite, the one who had dominated the circuit for years, and instead he was officially dethroned.\nThis week the challenge between the two tennis players begins in Toronto (despite Nole will skip the Canadia event to come back in Cincinnati – ed.) for this final part of the season, where it will be decided who will finish the season as world no.1.The Canadian tournament is very important for Carlistos, also because Nole will not be present at the event.\nCarlos Alcaraz shares truthful words on pressure\nIn the press conference, the young Spanish tennis player made important statements: “I still have the Wimbledon trophy in my living room, every time I have dinner or lunch with my family I see the title.\nIt’s something I absolutely don’t want to forget. I’ve only had a week to think about this success, not much time. I think it’s not much because all of this is really hard to imagine. Winning Wimbledon at just 20 is incredible, something I’ve dreamed of since the day I started playing tennis.\nIt was my fourth tournament played on grass, so it’s obviously unexpected for me. It’s an incredible achievement and I still can’t believe it today.”Alcaraz then said: “Everything came very quickly, big tournaments, two Grand Slam tournaments and I’m only 20 years old.\nI know I’m very young but I’ve been working for big things for a long time, sometimes I think about the match points I had at the US Open and Wimbledon and I still have goosebumps now, it’s incredible. Last year in Canada? I didn’t have a great tournament and now I want to change that.\nI want to do better than last season, I learned from those weeks and I know how to handle the pressure. I’ve grown both as a tennis player and as a person, it’s great to be here. I feel the love of the people and all this is special.”Alcaraz will debut in the second round against the winner of the match between Ben Shelton and Zapata Bernabè.\n\nDocument 3: Carlos Alcaraz was introduced to Roger Federer at a practice match by his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero. Carlos Alcaraz’s first meeting with Roger Federer was in 2019. Alcaraz was a fresh face to Federer as he was not that popular at that time.\nCarlos Alcaraz now has the 2023 Wimbledon title, one of the youngest to have this prestigious title. The Spaniard is very jocular about his win at the Wimbledon this year. Alcaraz made his commitment fulfilled that he will win. Also, he wanted to halt Novak Djokovic’s winning streak of 5 Wimbledon titles and 45 wins on the center court. Alcaraz, the World No.1 makes his ranking much more justified for him winning the title to Novak Djokovic.\nIn 2019, Roger Federer was revving up his throttle for the practice session at the Wimbledon tournaments. Prior to his quarterfinal match against Kei Nishikori, Federer enlisted the help of the Spanish tennis star Juan Carlos Ferrero for his warmup match. At the end of the warmup session, Carlos Alcaraz’s first meeting with Roger Federer was made by his coach. Ferrero introduced Roger to Spain’s fresh upcoming star “Carlos Alcaraz”.\nThis incident could be Alcaraz’s most exciting moment as a young teenager, meeting the Swiss legend. Alcaraz got much more will to pursue his dream to be the champion off this incident of playing against a living legend at a young age.\nCarlos Alcaraz was first exposed to the public view in an interview with tennis majors in 2020. Carlos Alcaraz provided them with many answers including,\n“It went extremely well, it was a unique experience for me,” Alcaraz said.\n“I was very pleased afterwards and I learnt a lot.\n“At the beginning I was a bit nervous since a lot of people were watching us, but as the practice went on I started to relax more and ultimately I enjoyed it very much”\nCarlos Alcaraz’s win at the 2023 Wimbledon\nThis match was between Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic, the No.1 v/s the No.2. The match between them was the third-longest match in Wimbledon final history, lasting nearly 5 hours. Wimbledon now also has a new face for the title and a pretty young one at that.\n\nDocument 4: ‘I don’t think he’s going to stop at 24 titles.’\nUS Open 2023 results: Novak Djokovic wins 24th major Tennis superstar Novak Djokovic has won a record-equalling 24th Grand Slam…\nThe US Open winner hailed his rivalry with Carlos Alcaraz.\n‘His passing hurt me deeply.’\n‘What are you still doing here?!’\nThe Serbian has now lifted THREE major trophies this year!\nThe 19-year-old lifts her first Grand Slam trophy!\nHe is one win away from a 24th Grand Slam title!\nUS Open 2023 results: Jack Draper wins, Dan Evans loses to Carlos Alcaraz, Cameron Norrie & Katie Boulter out Britain’s…\nMixed day for the British players at Flushing Meadows.\nUS Open 2023: Andy Murray calls VAR debut a ‘farce’ Britain’s Andy Murray has described Video Assist Review (VAR) as…\n‘The smell, oh my gosh.’\nCarlos Alcaraz can retain his title while Jessica Pegula can win a first slam.\nA change of plan for Venus Williams.\n‘I want her out.

It is used to separate mixtures, to check the purity of a mixture, or to monitor the progress of a reaction. The polarity of the solute, polarity of solvent, and polarity of adsorbent are crucial factors that determine the mobility rate of a compound along a TLC plate. This technique helps separate different mixtures of compounds based on their mobility differences. TLC can also be used to identify compounds by comparing it to a known compound\nThin layer chromatography (TLC): this technique was used to separate dried liquids with using liquid solvent (mobile phase) and a glass plate covered with silica gel (stationary phase). Basically, we can use any organic substance (cellulose polyamide, polyethylene, etc.) or inorganic substance (silica gel, aluminum oxide, etc.) in TLC. These substances must be able to divide and form uniform layers. On the surface of the plate, will be a very thin layer of silica which is considered the stationary phase. Then, add a small amount of solvent into a wide-mouth container (i.e. beaker or developing jar) just enough to cover the bottom of the container. Place the prepared TLC plate into the sealed container which has small amount of a solvent (moving phase). Due to capillary action, the solvent moves up to the plate and now we can remove the plate and analyze the Rf values.\nUsually TLC is done on a glass, plastic, or aluminum plate coated with silica gel, aluminum oxide, or cellulose. This coating is called the stationary phase. The sample is then applied to the bottom of the plate and the plate placed in a solvent, or the mobile phase. Capillary action pushes the sample up the plate. The rate the samples move up the plate depends on how tightly the sample binds to the stationary phase. This is determined by polarity. The Rf values or the Retention Factors are then compared for analysis. The retardation factor of a solute is defined as the ratio between the distance traveled by a compound to that of the solvent in a given amount of time. For this reason, Rf values will vary from a minimum of 0.0 to a maximum of 1.0.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:bbcece3d-0267-4c90-9fd9-da4bc53e471f>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Using a pencil, a dim line was drawn across the paper approximately two centimeters from the sharpened tip of the paper. A plant extract was then applied, in repeated strokes, across the pencil line. Between each stroke time was allowed for the plant extract to dry—this process was enhanced by blowing on the paper after each application. The application of the plant extract was stopped when an ample amount had accumulated, forming a thin stripe. An acetone solution was placed within a test tube, but the amount of acetone used depended on the length of the chromatography paper because only the tip of the paper was positioned in the solution. The chromatography paper was attached to a paper clip and fastened to a cork that was stuck in the opening of the test tube.\nBetween eight and ten minutes was then allowed for the acetone solution to travel up the length of the chromatography paper. After this allotted time the paper was removed from the test tube and the furthest distance that the solvent traveled was marked with a pencil, and the distance it traveled was measured and recorded in Table 1. Then, using a completed chromatogram the locations of the various pigments were found, and thus the different pigments were identified. The distance of each of the pigments from the origin of the plant extract was measured and also recorded in Table 1. The following equation was then used to calculate the Rf:\nRf= Distance moved by pigment\nDistance from pigment origin to solvent front\nThese findings were then recorded in Table 1.\nTable 1 shows that out of all the pigments chlorophyll b traveled the smallest distance—2.1 centimeters—from the plant extract source. Chlorophyll a was next having moved a distance of 3.0 centimeters, and xanthophyll followed moving an additional centimeter with a distance of 4.0 centimeters. The pigment carotene moved the furthest from the plant extract origin. Its distance, more than double that of xanthophyll, was 8.6 centimeters.\nThe Rf represents the relationship between how far a pigment moved in comparison to the distance traveled by the solvent. The Rf for chlorophyll b (.227cm) is a number smaller than those for the remaining pigments, therefore, clearly it moved the smallest distance.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:f593e84b-22f3-4a0f-892b-81cbb9d31301>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "Chromatography is a separation process involving two stages, stationary and mobile phase. Mixture to be examined is adsorbed in stationary phase and mobile phase is passed into it, eventually compounds of mix have separated based on rate of adsorption and solubility. Both are physical properties. Normally, within this chromatography, a glass tube is full of adsorbent alumina or silica gel up-to one third of it is length. Then, it is saturated with selective solvent. Sometimes, column is full of slurry adsorbent + solvent. The column should have no space. Such a column is said as ‘well packed column’. In this technique, less polar compound will be eluted first. Because, less polar compound won’t be as adsorbed in polar stationary phase. Finally, more polar compound will come out.\nIn TLC, a plate glass/plastic is coated with a thin layer of solid adsorbent. A little drop of mixture is seen near the bottom of plate. Then, plate is set in solvent chamber in this a way that only bottom component gets dipped into solvent mobile phase. This liquid gradually rises up to TLC. In this approach, separation is measured by RF value. Separated compounds move to different space, which can be expressed by retention factor RF worth. Compound of lower polarity will have greater RF worth than more polar ones. Within this chromatography, stationary phase is water adsorbed in newspaper and mobile phase is combinations of different organic solvent and water. Any fall of organic solvent on a filter paper becomes partitioned between water and solvent. Then, this paper is dipped into variety of solvent mixtures and chromatograms are developed.\nAscending and descending, this two kinds of development generally occur. Like TLC, within this method too, separation is expressed by RF value. Compounds with higher RF value has lower polarity and vice versa. This is the most modern technique of what is chromatography. It is often utilized in analytical chemistry. In this technique, sample vaporized without decomposition is injected into pillar. The sample is transferred through this column from the flow of mobile phase. Here, mobile phase is inert carrier gases Ex- He or nitrogen. Column is coated with different stationary phases. So, essentially, elements of examined mixture are partitioned between strong stationary phase and portable gas. Each compounds elute in another time, which is called retention time.

It is used to separate mixtures, to check the purity of a mixture, or to monitor the progress of a reaction. The polarity of the solute, polarity of solvent, and polarity of adsorbent are crucial factors that determine the mobility rate of a compound along a TLC plate. This technique helps separate different mixtures of compounds based on their mobility differences. TLC can also be used to identify compounds by comparing it to a known compound\nThin layer chromatography (TLC): this technique was used to separate dried liquids with using liquid solvent (mobile phase) and a glass plate covered with silica gel (stationary phase). Basically, we can use any organic substance (cellulose polyamide, polyethylene, etc.) or inorganic substance (silica gel, aluminum oxide, etc.) in TLC. These substances must be able to divide and form uniform layers. On the surface of the plate, will be a very thin layer of silica which is considered the stationary phase. Then, add a small amount of solvent into a wide-mouth container (i.e. beaker or developing jar) just enough to cover the bottom of the container. Place the prepared TLC plate into the sealed container which has small amount of a solvent (moving phase). Due to capillary action, the solvent moves up to the plate and now we can remove the plate and analyze the Rf values.\nUsually TLC is done on a glass, plastic, or aluminum plate coated with silica gel, aluminum oxide, or cellulose. This coating is called the stationary phase. The sample is then applied to the bottom of the plate and the plate placed in a solvent, or the mobile phase. Capillary action pushes the sample up the plate. The rate the samples move up the plate depends on how tightly the sample binds to the stationary phase. This is determined by polarity. The Rf values or the Retention Factors are then compared for analysis. The retardation factor of a solute is defined as the ratio between the distance traveled by a compound to that of the solvent in a given amount of time. For this reason, Rf values will vary from a minimum of 0.0 to a maximum of 1.0.\n\nDocument 3: Chromatography is a separation process involving two stages, stationary and mobile phase. Mixture to be examined is adsorbed in stationary phase and mobile phase is passed into it, eventually compounds of mix have separated based on rate of adsorption and solubility. Both are physical properties. Normally, within this chromatography, a glass tube is full of adsorbent alumina or silica gel up-to one third of it is length. Then, it is saturated with selective solvent. Sometimes, column is full of slurry adsorbent + solvent. The column should have no space. Such a column is said as ‘well packed column’. In this technique, less polar compound will be eluted first. Because, less polar compound won’t be as adsorbed in polar stationary phase. Finally, more polar compound will come out.\nIn TLC, a plate glass/plastic is coated with a thin layer of solid adsorbent. A little drop of mixture is seen near the bottom of plate. Then, plate is set in solvent chamber in this a way that only bottom component gets dipped into solvent mobile phase. This liquid gradually rises up to TLC. In this approach, separation is measured by RF value. Separated compounds move to different space, which can be expressed by retention factor RF worth. Compound of lower polarity will have greater RF worth than more polar ones. Within this chromatography, stationary phase is water adsorbed in newspaper and mobile phase is combinations of different organic solvent and water. Any fall of organic solvent on a filter paper becomes partitioned between water and solvent. Then, this paper is dipped into variety of solvent mixtures and chromatograms are developed.\nAscending and descending, this two kinds of development generally occur. Like TLC, within this method too, separation is expressed by RF value. Compounds with higher RF value has lower polarity and vice versa. This is the most modern technique of what is chromatography. It is often utilized in analytical chemistry. In this technique, sample vaporized without decomposition is injected into pillar. The sample is transferred through this column from the flow of mobile phase. Here, mobile phase is inert carrier gases Ex- He or nitrogen. Column is coated with different stationary phases. So, essentially, elements of examined mixture are partitioned between strong stationary phase and portable gas. Each compounds elute in another time, which is called retention time. Compounds eluted at different retention period then get detected in a variety of detectors. Finally, these are listed in a recorder and chromatograms are accessed.\n\nDocument 4: However, this retardation factor for a given protein compound will vary widely with changes in the adsorbents and/or solvents utilized. In addition, the retardation factor can vary greatly with the content of moisture in the adsorbent. The Rf values or the Retention Factors are then compared for analysis. This Rf value can be quantified as such:\nRf = (Distance that compound has traveled)/ (distance that the solvent has traveled)\nA light pencil line is drawn approximately 7 mm from the bottom of the plate and a small drop of a solution of the dye mixture is placed along the line.

Line the beaker with some filter paper soaked in solvent because this will help in the process of separating the mixture. Saturating the atmosphere in the beaker with solvent vapor stops the solvent from evaporating as it rises up the plate.\nAs the solvent slowly travels up the plate, the different components of the dye mixture travel at different rates and the mixture is separated into different colored spots. The solvent is allowed to rise until it approximately 1-1.5 cm from the top of the plate. This gives the maximum separation of the dye components for this particular combination of solvent and stationary phase.\nOnce the maximum separation of the dye components for this particular solvent and stationary phase solvent is induced, the TLC plate is removed from the beaker and allowed to dry. Immediately after removing the TLC plate, use a pencil to mark the solvent front before the solvent begins to evaporate.\n\nDocument 5: How is signal to noise calculated?\nIn basic terms, SNR is the difference between the desired signal and the noise floor.

A plant extract was then applied, in repeated strokes, across the pencil line. Between each stroke time was allowed for the plant extract to dry—this process was enhanced by blowing on the paper after each application. The application of the plant extract was stopped when an ample amount had accumulated, forming a thin stripe. An acetone solution was placed within a test tube, but the amount of acetone used depended on the length of the chromatography paper because only the tip of the paper was positioned in the solution. The chromatography paper was attached to a paper clip and fastened to a cork that was stuck in the opening of the test tube.\nBetween eight and ten minutes was then allowed for the acetone solution to travel up the length of the chromatography paper. After this allotted time the paper was removed from the test tube and the furthest distance that the solvent traveled was marked with a pencil, and the distance it traveled was measured and recorded in Table 1. Then, using a completed chromatogram the locations of the various pigments were found, and thus the different pigments were identified. The distance of each of the pigments from the origin of the plant extract was measured and also recorded in Table 1. The following equation was then used to calculate the Rf:\nRf= Distance moved by pigment\nDistance from pigment origin to solvent front\nThese findings were then recorded in Table 1.\nTable 1 shows that out of all the pigments chlorophyll b traveled the smallest distance—2.1 centimeters—from the plant extract source. Chlorophyll a was next having moved a distance of 3.0 centimeters, and xanthophyll followed moving an additional centimeter with a distance of 4.0 centimeters. The pigment carotene moved the furthest from the plant extract origin. Its distance, more than double that of xanthophyll, was 8.6 centimeters.\nThe Rf represents the relationship between how far a pigment moved in comparison to the distance traveled by the solvent. The Rf for chlorophyll b (.227cm) is a number smaller than those for the remaining pigments, therefore, clearly it moved the smallest distance.\n\nDocument 7: Calculating specific enzyme activity - (Jan/19/2007 )\nI've been using a 4-MU assay to measure enzyme activity.

Different solvents, stationary phases, and temperatures can alter the RF values, so it is important to maintain consistent conditions when comparing results."}
{"id": 7, "question": "Why do large trucks need to make such wide turns at intersections?", "passages": [{"passage": "Wide Right Turns a Big Road Hazard\nOver 4,000 people die in large truck accidents annually, and out of those deaths, some 68 percent of them are riding in a passenger vehicle. Accidents involving large trucks can be devastating simply due to the weight and size of commercial trucks. They can weigh up to 40 tons, compared to one to five tons for an average passenger vehicle. One of the most common types of trucking accidents involves wide right turns which are exceptionally dangerous because they can result in head on collisions. If you have been injured in a commercial trucking accident, you need to speak with an experienced personal injury attorney as soon as possible.\nWhy Wide Right Turn Accidents Occur\nIf you visualize how a truck has to make a right turn it is easier to understand how these accidents happen. The size of a truck makes it hard to maneuver a truck. To manage these turns, a truck must swing the truck to the left first. This can result in one of several types of right turn accidents. If the truck swings their vehicle to the left too far, it can veer into the next lane of traffic and strike the vehicles there.\nThe second type of wide right turn accident occurs if the truck driver doesn’t go far enough to the left before attempting to turn right. The failure to swing sufficiently to the left can cause the truck to roll over. This can be devastating enough because it could cause cargo to spill onto other vehicles or the roadway or result in a fire. In even more devastating situations, the truck could roll over on top of nearby vehicles.\nThe third common type of wide right turn accident occurs where there are two right turning lanes. When a truck turns, it may veer into the second turn lane. If a car is in that lane, it may be trapped or crushed by the turning truck.\nAlthough a truck driver should always use a turn signal to indicate their intentions, many drivers fail to realize how much a berth a truck needs to make a right turn. This may result in them not giving the truck enough space.\nDetermining Liability in a Wide Right Turn Accident\nIf you have suffered injuries in a wide right turn accident, you may be entitled to receive compensation for your injuries and damages. However, who pays the compensation depends on who is liable for the accident.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:50ce392d-1f88-4f97-aa5a-9da4fd3a07e2>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "I would refer to the WB-62 design vehicle, which means a multi-unit tractor-trailer combination that has a 62 foot wheel base. This truck is actually about 69 feet from nose to tail. There are also the WB-40 and the WB-50 and the WB-65. For trivia purposes, the WB-65, which is 74 feet from nose to tail, is the vehicle used when designing interstaets and interstate ramp terminals.\nThe importance of the design vehicle becomes clear when you start putting together the design of intersections and sharp curves. Larger trucks need more room in order to make turns. The rear wheels of a truck–well, of any vehicle, really–will run to the inside of the front wheels. This wider path made during a turn is called overtracking, and its why you see large trucks swing out really wide when they’re making right angle turns at intersections. The distance and width needed to ensure that the rear wheels of the design vehicle stay off the edge of pavement, or out of the adjacent lanes, can add a lot of cost to a design project.\nNext time you’re walking in an area that has curbs and you come to an intersection, look at the corners. Do you see tire tracks up against the curb faces? Do you see tire tracks on top of the curb, or on the sidewalk? Are the corners, maybe including the pedestrian ramps, broken and cracked? If any of these are true, it means most likely that truck drivers are running their rear wheels up and over the curbs when they’re trying to make turns. This could be becuase the driver isn’t very good, but more likely it’s because there’s not enough room for the trucks to clear when taking their overtracking into account.\nLarge vehicles are also important to consider when we’re designing intersections and considering the time it takes to accelerate. For example, the distance you need to be able to see to your left, or to your right, when you’re trying to turn onto a roadway. On a 45 mile per hour road, with no other consideations, that distance should be 500 feet if you’re driving a car. If you’re driving a tractor trailer, then I have to add another 270 feet! A football field worth of view, basically. That means no hills, curves or bushes to block the view of that truck driver trying to make a left turn.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:54f60966-a5e3-4d4f-8ef5-d96bfd906df1>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "04 Jun Safety Matters: Trucking\nDriving a truck comes with a number of constant hazards that drivers need to be aware of in order to keep themselves and others on the road safe. Share the following Safety Matters with your drivers.\nAvoiding Right Turn Squeeze Crashes\nLarge commercial vehicles can be challenging to maneuver, particularly on residential and city streets. Taking a turn too sharply or widely can lead to costly accidents and serious injuries. One common type of accident is the right turn squeeze crash, which occurs when a truck driver makes a wide right turn, leaving too much distance between the truck and the curb. When doing so, other drivers on the road may try to squeeze past the truck and could end up getting their vehicle caught underneath the truck’s trailer.\nIn order to make right turns as safe as possible, drivers should be aware of their environments and the potential challenges that they may impose. For example, a particularly narrow intersection can make right turns especially dangerous.\nIt is also important that the vehicles and trailers are in proper working order. A broken turn signal or a lack of adequate mirrors will make any type of driving unsafe.\nThere are many steps to making a turn. As a truck driver, you have a responsibility for not only your own safety, but that of pedestrians and other drivers as well. When making a right turn, adhere to the following steps in order to make the process as safe as possible:\n- Prepare for the turn by moving into the right-hand lane as early as you can.\n- Activate your turn signal well in advance, and reduce your speed.\n- As you approach the intersection, observe the area and make sure that you will be able to safely complete the turn.\n- When beginning your turn, keep the rear of your trailer in the right-hand lane and close to the curb.\n- Avoid swinging wide to the left or crossing into other lanes.\n- Use your mirrors to check for other vehicles, pedestrians or obstructions.\n- Never back up when completing a turn.\nIf you are unable to finish a turn, wait for other traffic to clear to do so.\nAs a driver, safety should be your top priority. If you find that a turn may not be possible, it is better to take a slight detour and ensure that you will be able to get to your destination safely. A small delay is far less costly than an accident. If you have any questions about making right turns safely, talk to your supervisor.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:f65fd5df-0640-41a6-bf64-6a33dbebff7c>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Anyone who has ever traveled on a freeway or highway has probably come into range of a large truck or semi. These vehicles are massive in comparison to smaller passenger vehicles, so it makes sense that drivers may feel wary when they approach larger trucks.\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration explains that it’s important to give large trucks enough space around them. Doing so makes it possible for the driver to see your vehicle by keeping the blind spots clear. Additionally, staying a distance away from the vehicle may give the driver more time to slow down or maneuver when necessary.\nLarge trucks have four main blind spots\nWhen you approach a semitruck from the back, remember that there are four blind spots that you need to keep your vehicle out of. The first blind spot is directly behind the vehicle. If you are close enough to the back that you can’t see the driver’s mirrors, the driver cannot see you.\nTwo additional blind spots run along the sides of a semi. These are areas in which the mirror is angled in a way that it will miss any vehicles next to the truck, and the driver won’t see them when looking over, either.\nThe fourth blind spot is in front of the truck. If you weave in front of the truck too closely, the driver won’t be able to see you over the front hood.\nStopping distances are a challenge for large truck drivers\nAnother reason you need to give more space to large trucks is because of their stopping distances. Trucks, buses and other large vehicles need more time to stop, so you’ll want to be several car lengths ahead of the vehicle at all times.\nTurns become problematic for truck drivers\nDue to the shape of a large truck, drivers often have trouble turning and staying in the correct lane when turning right. They may swing wide to make enough room for their trailers. Passenger vehicle drivers should stay behind the white lines painted on the road to give them enough room to turn.\nThese are a few reasons why you need to be aware of large trucks and maintain your distance. Staying away could help you avoid a truck crash.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:330dd5a0-aec1-4b6e-95bd-0ffd13f3246e>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Truck drivers admittedly recognize that making a right turn with their long and heavy loads is not easy. Every experienced big rig driver will admit that negotiating a right turn can be downright dangerous and likely have many accounts they could tell demonstrating this.\nClearly, the size of the big rigs themselves require that the big rig operators understand the special techniques required to negotiate right hand turns and be even more vigilant for pedestrians and vehicles around them while they negotiate the turn.\nA common scenario leading to a collision between a big rig and an auto during a right hand turn is due to the ‘swinging rear.’ As the truck makes its right turn, the rear of the trailer will swing in the opposite direction. In other words, to the left. This can cause a portion of the rear end of the truck end to up several inches (perhaps even feet) over into the adjoining lane. Should a car be there while the truck is ‘swinging’ over into the lane and comes into contact with another car, the force has at times caused these cars to be then pushed out of their lane and into the next adjoining lane resulting in the middle car getting crushed. The collisions are especially dangerous when the car that got hit by the rear of the big rig gets pushed in a lane involving traffic going in the opposite direction.\nThe size and length of many tractor trailers is an issue when negotiating the right turn which can be compounded if the street is not very wide. Oftentimes, truck drivers find themselves actually crossing the double lines of a two way street in order to get their big rig setup to complete the right hand turn. Therefore, many 18 wheeler tractor trailer collisions involve vehicles that were heading in the opposite direction of the big rig but were struck during the turn.\nPedestrians can also be crushed during a right hand turn scenario. At times, a pedestrian will pass while the big rig while it is negotiating the right hand turn. Many pedestrians, especially children, have nearly no experience walking near big rigs and may not take into consideration that the big rig will come swinging back. Other times, a big rig operator will simply end up crossing into the bike or pedestrian lanes taking the bicyclist or pedestrian by surprise. Sadly these accidents usually result in severe injury or death.\nWe at the Law Offices of Edward A. Smith respects those in the big rig community and the services they provide our nation.

Safe drivers will avoid the truck’s No-Zones and wait to assess the truck driver’s intent before passing.\nAs a general rule, avoid passing trucks while turning and never pass them on the right side.\nDon’t Crowd an Intersection\nMany intersections are marked with stop lines, indicating where a driver must come to a complete stop.

Truck accidents can cause a horrendous amount of destruction due to how much weight and force they carry.\nLuckily, there are a few things any driver can do to stay safe while sharing the road with large trucks. Here are some tips:\n- Always be especially alert when driving near a large trailer truck or big rig. Look out for any sudden swerves or movements.\n- Make sure you’re always visible to the driver of the truck. Trucks have massive blind spots and a higher cab, so it can be difficult for truck drivers to see passenger cars. Avoid driving in a truck’s blind spots and make yourself visible directly from the driver’s cab if possible. If you can see the driver in their mirror, they should be able to see you as well.\n- Turn your headlights on in conditions where the light is low to help truck drivers see your better.\n- Keep a safer difference than you normally would when following or driving alongside a large truck. Keep an extra lane between the truck and your vehicle if possible.\n- Give trucks as much room as possible when you notice they’re making a turn. The driver will need to make a wide turn and it may be wider than you expect. While waiting your turn at an intersection, for example, you may want to give the truck the entire intersection to make their turn before moving forward.\n- Give large trucks more space to stop. The larger the vehicle, the more time it takes for the driver to stop. Overcompensate if you have to. A large truck with full cargo can take as much as 300 yards to come to a complete stop from 60mph.\n- When driving around a large truck, plan your moves well ahead of time and give truck drivers more time to respond to your actions.\n- Use your turn signals earlier and merge/change lanes ahead of time. If you’re afraid of being too close to the truck and need to stop, alert the driver ahead of time with a quick “tap” on your brakes.\n- When passing a large truck, try and pass on the right side.

Truck driver errors are usually the underlying reasons these wrecks occur. Common causes include:\n- Crossing the centerline. Whenever a trucker crosses the center lane, for whatever reason, a head-on collision is the likely result, as there's little time or space for lane correction.\n- Making wide turns. If a driver doesn't navigate a turn properly, he can cross right into another vehicle's lane.\n- Speeding around a curve. While speeding is never safe, doing so on a curve can make a trucker lose control of his truck and cross over the center lane.\n- Going through a stop. If a truck driver runs a red light or goes through a stop sign without the right of way, he can cause a head-on collision with a driver legally turning left in the intersection.\n- Passing improperly. When a truck driver attempts to pass a vehicle on a two-lane road or highway and doesn't have enough clearance, he could hit an oncoming vehicle if he has insufficient time to get back into his lane.\n- Causing a jackknife accident. Sharp turns and avoidance maneuvers sometimes causes a truck to jackknife, sending it head-on into other vehicles.\n- Driving when drowsy. If a trucker is fighting to stay awake or falls asleep at the wheel, he can veer into oncoming traffic.\n- Engaging in distracted driving.

Accidents involving large trucks can be devastating simply due to the weight and size of commercial trucks. They can weigh up to 40 tons, compared to one to five tons for an average passenger vehicle. One of the most common types of trucking accidents involves wide right turns which are exceptionally dangerous because they can result in head on collisions. If you have been injured in a commercial trucking accident, you need to speak with an experienced personal injury attorney as soon as possible.\nWhy Wide Right Turn Accidents Occur\nIf you visualize how a truck has to make a right turn it is easier to understand how these accidents happen. The size of a truck makes it hard to maneuver a truck. To manage these turns, a truck must swing the truck to the left first. This can result in one of several types of right turn accidents. If the truck swings their vehicle to the left too far, it can veer into the next lane of traffic and strike the vehicles there.\nThe second type of wide right turn accident occurs if the truck driver doesn’t go far enough to the left before attempting to turn right. The failure to swing sufficiently to the left can cause the truck to roll over. This can be devastating enough because it could cause cargo to spill onto other vehicles or the roadway or result in a fire. In even more devastating situations, the truck could roll over on top of nearby vehicles.\nThe third common type of wide right turn accident occurs where there are two right turning lanes. When a truck turns, it may veer into the second turn lane. If a car is in that lane, it may be trapped or crushed by the turning truck.\nAlthough a truck driver should always use a turn signal to indicate their intentions, many drivers fail to realize how much a berth a truck needs to make a right turn. This may result in them not giving the truck enough space.\nDetermining Liability in a Wide Right Turn Accident\nIf you have suffered injuries in a wide right turn accident, you may be entitled to receive compensation for your injuries and damages. However, who pays the compensation depends on who is liable for the accident.\n\nDocument 2: Driving alongside an 18-wheeler big rig or semi truck can be scary. Not only is the sheer size of a large truck intimidating, but at some point while sharing the road with one, we inevitably stop and think about just how devastating an accident with such a monstrous vehicle would be. Truck accidents can cause a horrendous amount of destruction due to how much weight and force they carry.\nLuckily, there are a few things any driver can do to stay safe while sharing the road with large trucks. Here are some tips:\n- Always be especially alert when driving near a large trailer truck or big rig. Look out for any sudden swerves or movements.\n- Make sure you’re always visible to the driver of the truck. Trucks have massive blind spots and a higher cab, so it can be difficult for truck drivers to see passenger cars. Avoid driving in a truck’s blind spots and make yourself visible directly from the driver’s cab if possible. If you can see the driver in their mirror, they should be able to see you as well.\n- Turn your headlights on in conditions where the light is low to help truck drivers see your better.\n- Keep a safer difference than you normally would when following or driving alongside a large truck. Keep an extra lane between the truck and your vehicle if possible.\n- Give trucks as much room as possible when you notice they’re making a turn. The driver will need to make a wide turn and it may be wider than you expect. While waiting your turn at an intersection, for example, you may want to give the truck the entire intersection to make their turn before moving forward.\n- Give large trucks more space to stop. The larger the vehicle, the more time it takes for the driver to stop. Overcompensate if you have to. A large truck with full cargo can take as much as 300 yards to come to a complete stop from 60mph.\n- When driving around a large truck, plan your moves well ahead of time and give truck drivers more time to respond to your actions.\n- Use your turn signals earlier and merge/change lanes ahead of time. If you’re afraid of being too close to the truck and need to stop, alert the driver ahead of time with a quick “tap” on your brakes.\n- When passing a large truck, try and pass on the right side. The right side has fewer blind spots than the left.\n\nDocument 3: I would refer to the WB-62 design vehicle, which means a multi-unit tractor-trailer combination that has a 62 foot wheel base. This truck is actually about 69 feet from nose to tail. There are also the WB-40 and the WB-50 and the WB-65. For trivia purposes, the WB-65, which is 74 feet from nose to tail, is the vehicle used when designing interstaets and interstate ramp terminals.\nThe importance of the design vehicle becomes clear when you start putting together the design of intersections and sharp curves. Larger trucks need more room in order to make turns. The rear wheels of a truck–well, of any vehicle, really–will run to the inside of the front wheels. This wider path made during a turn is called overtracking, and its why you see large trucks swing out really wide when they’re making right angle turns at intersections. The distance and width needed to ensure that the rear wheels of the design vehicle stay off the edge of pavement, or out of the adjacent lanes, can add a lot of cost to a design project.\nNext time you’re walking in an area that has curbs and you come to an intersection, look at the corners. Do you see tire tracks up against the curb faces? Do you see tire tracks on top of the curb, or on the sidewalk? Are the corners, maybe including the pedestrian ramps, broken and cracked? If any of these are true, it means most likely that truck drivers are running their rear wheels up and over the curbs when they’re trying to make turns. This could be becuase the driver isn’t very good, but more likely it’s because there’s not enough room for the trucks to clear when taking their overtracking into account.\nLarge vehicles are also important to consider when we’re designing intersections and considering the time it takes to accelerate. For example, the distance you need to be able to see to your left, or to your right, when you’re trying to turn onto a roadway. On a 45 mile per hour road, with no other consideations, that distance should be 500 feet if you’re driving a car. If you’re driving a tractor trailer, then I have to add another 270 feet! A football field worth of view, basically. That means no hills, curves or bushes to block the view of that truck driver trying to make a left turn.\n\nDocument 4: 04 Jun Safety Matters: Trucking\nDriving a truck comes with a number of constant hazards that drivers need to be aware of in order to keep themselves and others on the road safe. Share the following Safety Matters with your drivers.\nAvoiding Right Turn Squeeze Crashes\nLarge commercial vehicles can be challenging to maneuver, particularly on residential and city streets. Taking a turn too sharply or widely can lead to costly accidents and serious injuries. One common type of accident is the right turn squeeze crash, which occurs when a truck driver makes a wide right turn, leaving too much distance between the truck and the curb. When doing so, other drivers on the road may try to squeeze past the truck and could end up getting their vehicle caught underneath the truck’s trailer.\nIn order to make right turns as safe as possible, drivers should be aware of their environments and the potential challenges that they may impose. For example, a particularly narrow intersection can make right turns especially dangerous.\nIt is also important that the vehicles and trailers are in proper working order. A broken turn signal or a lack of adequate mirrors will make any type of driving unsafe.\nThere are many steps to making a turn. As a truck driver, you have a responsibility for not only your own safety, but that of pedestrians and other drivers as well. When making a right turn, adhere to the following steps in order to make the process as safe as possible:\n- Prepare for the turn by moving into the right-hand lane as early as you can.\n- Activate your turn signal well in advance, and reduce your speed.\n- As you approach the intersection, observe the area and make sure that you will be able to safely complete the turn.\n- When beginning your turn, keep the rear of your trailer in the right-hand lane and close to the curb.\n- Avoid swinging wide to the left or crossing into other lanes.\n- Use your mirrors to check for other vehicles, pedestrians or obstructions.\n- Never back up when completing a turn.\nIf you are unable to finish a turn, wait for other traffic to clear to do so.\nAs a driver, safety should be your top priority. If you find that a turn may not be possible, it is better to take a slight detour and ensure that you will be able to get to your destination safely. A small delay is far less costly than an accident. If you have any questions about making right turns safely, talk to your supervisor.\n\nDocument 5: Anyone who has ever traveled on a freeway or highway has probably come into range of a large truck or semi. These vehicles are massive in comparison to smaller passenger vehicles, so it makes sense that drivers may feel wary when they approach larger trucks.\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration explains that it’s important to give large trucks enough space around them. Doing so makes it possible for the driver to see your vehicle by keeping the blind spots clear. Additionally, staying a distance away from the vehicle may give the driver more time to slow down or maneuver when necessary.\nLarge trucks have four main blind spots\nWhen you approach a semitruck from the back, remember that there are four blind spots that you need to keep your vehicle out of. The first blind spot is directly behind the vehicle. If you are close enough to the back that you can’t see the driver’s mirrors, the driver cannot see you.\nTwo additional blind spots run along the sides of a semi. These are areas in which the mirror is angled in a way that it will miss any vehicles next to the truck, and the driver won’t see them when looking over, either.\nThe fourth blind spot is in front of the truck. If you weave in front of the truck too closely, the driver won’t be able to see you over the front hood.\nStopping distances are a challenge for large truck drivers\nAnother reason you need to give more space to large trucks is because of their stopping distances. Trucks, buses and other large vehicles need more time to stop, so you’ll want to be several car lengths ahead of the vehicle at all times.\nTurns become problematic for truck drivers\nDue to the shape of a large truck, drivers often have trouble turning and staying in the correct lane when turning right. They may swing wide to make enough room for their trailers. Passenger vehicle drivers should stay behind the white lines painted on the road to give them enough room to turn.\nThese are a few reasons why you need to be aware of large trucks and maintain your distance. Staying away could help you avoid a truck crash.\n\nDocument 6: Truck drivers admittedly recognize that making a right turn with their long and heavy loads is not easy. Every experienced big rig driver will admit that negotiating a right turn can be downright dangerous and likely have many accounts they could tell demonstrating this.\nClearly, the size of the big rigs themselves require that the big rig operators understand the special techniques required to negotiate right hand turns and be even more vigilant for pedestrians and vehicles around them while they negotiate the turn.\nA common scenario leading to a collision between a big rig and an auto during a right hand turn is due to the ‘swinging rear.’ As the truck makes its right turn, the rear of the trailer will swing in the opposite direction. In other words, to the left. This can cause a portion of the rear end of the truck end to up several inches (perhaps even feet) over into the adjoining lane. Should a car be there while the truck is ‘swinging’ over into the lane and comes into contact with another car, the force has at times caused these cars to be then pushed out of their lane and into the next adjoining lane resulting in the middle car getting crushed. The collisions are especially dangerous when the car that got hit by the rear of the big rig gets pushed in a lane involving traffic going in the opposite direction.\nThe size and length of many tractor trailers is an issue when negotiating the right turn which can be compounded if the street is not very wide. Oftentimes, truck drivers find themselves actually crossing the double lines of a two way street in order to get their big rig setup to complete the right hand turn. Therefore, many 18 wheeler tractor trailer collisions involve vehicles that were heading in the opposite direction of the big rig but were struck during the turn.\nPedestrians can also be crushed during a right hand turn scenario. At times, a pedestrian will pass while the big rig while it is negotiating the right hand turn. Many pedestrians, especially children, have nearly no experience walking near big rigs and may not take into consideration that the big rig will come swinging back. Other times, a big rig operator will simply end up crossing into the bike or pedestrian lanes taking the bicyclist or pedestrian by surprise. Sadly these accidents usually result in severe injury or death.\nWe at the Law Offices of Edward A. Smith respects those in the big rig community and the services they provide our nation. Many tractor trailer operators have years of safe driving habits. Many, however, have not been adequately trained in safety.\n\nDocument 7: Trucks Make Wide Turns\nWith a height up of up to 14 feet, fully-loaded trucks have a much higher center of gravity than typical passenger vehicles, or even SUVs (4.5 feet – 5 feet and 6.5 feet high, respectively). High centers of gravity make it easier for trucks to tip over. They will often move into adjacent lanes prior to and after a turning maneuver to avoid driving over a curb or sidewalk or hitting a car in an opposing travel lane.\nDon’t try to sneak past the right side and squeeze around them – it may be the last mistake you’ll ever make.\nWatch for the truck’s turn signal to see what the driver intends to do. Occasionally, truck drivers will fail to signal or the trailer signal light may be inoperative. Never attempt to cut in along the right side as the driver maneuvers left or you way become sandwiched between the turning truck and the curb. Safe drivers will avoid the truck’s No-Zones and wait to assess the truck driver’s intent before passing.\nAs a general rule, avoid passing trucks while turning and never pass them on the right side.\nDon’t Crowd an Intersection\nMany intersections are marked with stop lines, indicating where a driver must come to a complete stop. Crowding an intersection means to stop beyond the stop lines, leaving your vehicle exposed to trucks attempting to turn, as well as other vehicles and pedestrians. Crowding an intersection is illegal and puts you at risk of being hit by trucks and other vehicles turning from other areas of the intersection.\nDownload the wide turns fact sheet (pdf)\nA semi’s height (up to 14′), length and weight make it nearly impossible for the driver to make tight turns like regular cars and trucks. A fully-loaded truck also has a much higher center of gravity than typical passenger vehicles and SUVs, making it easier for a truck to tip over. Read more in the PDF.\n\nDocument 8: - Anticipate that a tractor-trailer will make wide turns. If a truck has a turn signal flashing, do not try to squeeze by the truck. When stopped at intersections, do not stop in front of the line. Trucks need that space to make wide turns.\n- Be sure to wear your seat belt when in a car.\n- Do not drive while impaired under any circumstances.\n- Watch out for other drivers who may be impaired, and report them to the police.\n- Avoid distractions and keep your eyes on the road.\n- Leave early and give yourself plenty of time to reach your destination.\nContact a Commercial Truck Accident Attorney Today\nHave you been hurt in a commercial truck accident in South Carolina?

A typical passenger vehicle weighs about 4,000 pounds. At an average speed of 65 mph, a semi-truck needs more than twice the stopping distance of a passenger vehicle. If a trucker doesn't have the time and space to avoid a crash, the force of the impact can be devastating. Unfortunately, head-on collisions are the leading cause of fatalities in truck accidents, causing 57.5 percent of all deaths in 2014.\nCauses of Deadly Head-On Collisions\nA head-on truck collision occurs when the front of a semi crashes into the front of another vehicle. Truck driver errors are usually the underlying reasons these wrecks occur. Common causes include:\n- Crossing the centerline. Whenever a trucker crosses the center lane, for whatever reason, a head-on collision is the likely result, as there's little time or space for lane correction.\n- Making wide turns. If a driver doesn't navigate a turn properly, he can cross right into another vehicle's lane.\n- Speeding around a curve. While speeding is never safe, doing so on a curve can make a trucker lose control of his truck and cross over the center lane.\n- Going through a stop. If a truck driver runs a red light or goes through a stop sign without the right of way, he can cause a head-on collision with a driver legally turning left in the intersection.\n- Passing improperly. When a truck driver attempts to pass a vehicle on a two-lane road or highway and doesn't have enough clearance, he could hit an oncoming vehicle if he has insufficient time to get back into his lane.\n- Causing a jackknife accident. Sharp turns and avoidance maneuvers sometimes causes a truck to jackknife, sending it head-on into other vehicles.\n- Driving when drowsy. If a trucker is fighting to stay awake or falls asleep at the wheel, he can veer into oncoming traffic.\n- Engaging in distracted driving. A distracted driver may be involved in talking on a cellphone, texting, looking at a GPS, or eating and drinking—behaviors that greatly reduce reaction time.\nIf you or a family member was injured in a head-on truck collision, call our office today to schedule your free consultation with Alan Morton.\n\nDocument 10: Look for pedestrians and use your turn signal before you exit. If there is no traffic in the roundabout, you may enter without yielding.\nTrucks/oversize vehicles and roundabouts\nRoundabouts are designed to accommodate vehicles of all sizes, including emergency vehicles, buses, farm equipment and semitrucks with trailers. Oversize vehicles and vehicles with trailers may straddle both lanes while driving through a roundabout.\nMany roundabouts are also designed with a truck apron, a raised section of pavement around the central island that acts as an extra lane for large vehicles. The back wheels of the oversize vehicle can ride up on the truck apron so the truck can easily complete the turn, while the raised portion of concrete discourages use by smaller vehicles.\nBecause large vehicles may need extra room to complete their turn in a roundabout, drivers should remember never to drive next to large vehicles in a roundabout.\n\nDocument 11: Oversized Load Truck Accident Lawyers in Kentucky\nTrucks with oversized loads pose a threat to others on the road because of their size and how difficult they are to drive safely. Many things can go wrong and cause an accident. It’s best to stay away from these vehicles as best you can.\nWhat is an Oversized Load?\nAn oversized load could be steel beams used on a bridge, wind turbines, drilling rig parts, or manufactured housing.\nThere are oversized and overweight loads. They go beyond the dimensions accepted by a state, while an overweight load is heavier than the standard weight. Kentucky’s accepted truck weight and sizes can be found here. Municipalities can have restrictions on local roads. The federal government also imposes rules on hauling oversized loads.\nInterstate and other major highways generally have 12-foot-wide travel lanes. The maximum legal vehicle width is 8.5 feet in every state. If a load is bigger than that, it’s an oversized load. A load that’s extra long or high is also oversized.\nSpecial permits are required to move this cargo legally, and specific safety procedures must be followed. There may be escort vehicles, special lighting, and flags to make the trip safer for all involved.\nWhy is Hauling an Oversized Load Dangerous?\nOversized loads are hazardous to other road traffic and structures along the route, such as bridges and overpasses. Oversized loads often impede traffic and block lanes. There may be secondary accidents caused when traffic backs up or drivers try to pass trucks carrying oversized loads.\nWhen hauling an excessively wide, long, tall, or heavy load, there are risks that drivers must consider to avoid an accident, according to Equipment and Contracting. This includes:\n- The load’s weight may deflate tires, causing a blowout and loss of control\n- The truck is more likely to roll over, especially at higher speeds and making turns\n- The load’s weight and extreme dimensions mean it has a momentum all its own, which may be difficult for the truck and driver to control.\n\nDocument 12: CNN explores a burning question: why do commercial delivery couriers always favour right hand turns? Apparently these services save “millions of gallons of fuel each year, and avoids emissions equivalent to over 20,000 passenger cars.” with this one practice. By avoiding left turns, you are avoiding delays that can make for traffic build ups. Even a left turning phase adds approximately 45 seconds to a left turn.\nAnd there is more-“a study on crash factors in intersection-related accidents from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Association shows that turning left is one of the leading “critical pre-crash events” (an event that made a collision inevitable), occurring in 22.2 percent of crashes, as opposed to 1.2 percent for right turns. ” Over 60 per cent of crashes happen while turning left, compared to 3 per cent of crashes involving right turns.\nInformation from data collected by New York City’s transportation planners conclude that pedestrians are three times more likely to be killed from left turn vehicles. The UPS carriers assess all the routes to avoid left hand turns to minimize idling time and increase time sensitivity. They have rebooted Google maps to reflect routes that minimize left hand turns, a practice developed in the 1970’s with the term “Loop Dispatch”.\nWhile this works great for pre-planned routes, in daily driving routes are less random. But when you see a big company courier truck making a left turn in traffic, you will know they are deviating from the “Loop Dispatch” plan.\n\nDocument 13: When it comes to truck driving, safety is paramount. The sheer size of the vehicles alone makes them a hazard on the road, and they are far more likely to cause accidents and injuries than cars, motorbikes, and cycles are. If you’re a truck driver, you need to make sure you’re doing all you can, all the time, to keep yourself and your fellow road users safe and to ensure you don’t let accidents strip you of your trucking authority.\nBe aware of YOUR speed limits\nMore often than not, speed limit signs will dictate one maximum speed limit for smaller vehicles, and another one for larger ones. Your truck will fall under the larger-vehicle limit, which will be slower than the one imposed on cars, and it is of the utmost importance that you are aware of this. Do not confuse the limits, as doing so will see you go faster than you should be going with your type of vehicle, and will, therefore, make you more of a danger.\nYou should be particularly aware of your speed when you come to turns in the road. Trucks are far more likely to lose control of themselves as they curve than cars are, and their drivers MUST slow down when their road begins to deviate.\nPay attention to your space cushion\nYour space cushion is the room that immediately surrounds your truck on all of its sides, and other vehicles shouldn’t be encroaching upon it. Of course, you cannot account for other drivers, and anybody could get too close to you at any time. What you can account for, however, is your own driving skills, and making sure your truck never gets too close to anything else that it shares the road with.\nImportantly, this means maintaining a safe distance between yourself and the vehicle in front of you. As your truck will have more weight, size, and power than all of the cars that it follows, you going into the back of one can and will cause serious damage. For this reason, you should stay two vehicle lengths behind cars when the traffic is free-flowing, allowing you a safe stop time should the course you are taking dictate you to halt.\nMake sure your truck can be seen\nAs mentioned, the size of trucks makes them one of the biggest dangers on the road, and it is for this reason why safety procedures must be in place to ensure other road users know when your truck is approaching them.\n\nDocument 14: Longer wheel bases on motorhomes and trucks towing RV trailers make it necessary to change your turning patterns. You must turn wider at intersections or the rear wheel may roll over the curb. Go further into the intersection before starting the turn and adjust your lane position to increase the turning radius.\nCurves in the highway can also be tricky. Stay more to the center of the lane for right turns so the rear wheels will not move off the pavement. For a left turn or curve, stay more to the right of the lane to prevent the back of the trailer from tracking into the oncoming lane\nRecreational vehicles have a high center of gravity, so turning corners and taking curves must be done at slower speeds to prevent swaying. Slowdown before you enter the curve. Be sure you use your rear-view mirrors to watch tracking and tail swing.\n\nDocument 15: Thursday, April 23, 2009\nWhen does a truck need another truck?\nGlenn Adams sent us these webcam snaps of our mast truck being loaded for transport.\nJust as the German trucks were not automatically allowed on US roads when we first brought them in (they are fine now), our US spec truck has the reverse issue in Germany!\nThe German trucks are not quite as long, and have a better turning circle -- crucial for navigating traffic circles (kreisverkehr) and other tight spots on European roads, among other things. Our truck is longer, with a mid-mounted drop-axle, to better distribute weight -- a requirement for operating on highways here in the US.\n\nQuestion: Why do large trucks need to make such wide turns at intersections?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Large trucks need to make wide turns at intersections due to their size and weight, which affect their maneuverability and stability. The wide turns are necessary to ensure the truck's rear wheels do not roll over the curb or sidewalk, or cross into other lanes, potentially causing accidents. This is supported by multiple documents:\n\n- The size of a truck makes it hard to maneuver turns, requiring a wide swing to the left before turning right to avoid hitting vehicles in adjacent lanes or rolling over.\n- Larger trucks need more room to make turns due to overtracking, the wider path made during a turn.\n- When making a right turn, it's crucial to keep the rear of the trailer in the right-hand lane and close to the curb to avoid swinging wide and crossing into other lanes.\n- Large trucks have blind spots and longer stopping distances, necessitating extra space when turning.\n- The'swinging rear' issue, where the rear of the trailer swings to the left during a right turn, can cause collisions with vehicles in adjacent lanes.\n- Trucks must move into adjacent lanes before and after turning to avoid driving over curbs or hitting cars in opposing lanes.\n- Recreational vehicle drivers should turn wider at intersections to prevent the rear wheel from rolling over the curb due to longer wheel bases.\n\nThese documents collectively illustrate the necessity for large trucks to make wide turns at intersections to ensure safety and prevent accidents."}
{"id": 8, "question": "What was the purpose of the uprising in Italy in 1861 led by Garibaldi and his thousand men?", "passages": [{"passage": "France sent 30,000 men to fight for the Pope and when these troops attacked Rome, Garibaldi organised the defence of the city while Mazzini controlled its government. Garibaldi's troops, wearing their famous red shirts, were defeated, but most of them managed to escape, and Garibaldi went to the United States. Returning to Europe in 1854, he settled on Caprera, a tiny island off Sardinia.\nIn 1859 Garibaldi was fighting the Austrians in north Italy once more, this time successfully. In May 1860, with 1,000 volunteers, he landed on the island of Sicily (off southern Italy) where the people were suffering under the brutal rule of King Francis of Naples. Within three months 25,000 of King Francis's troops were defeated, and Garibaldi led his men to the mainland of Italy, won the Battle of Reggio and marched on Naples. Francis fled and his kingdom of southern Italy was handed over to King Victor Emmanuel of Sardinia, who afterwards became King of the whole of Italy. Garibaldi, rejecting all offers of wealth and titles, returned to his simple farm on the island of Caprera.\nFrom there in 1862 he returned once more to raise an army and march on Rome, which was still a separate state ruled by the Pope. However, Victor Emmanuel did not want further strife and forced Garibaldi to stop. In 1867 he tried again and was defeated by the Pope's army, which had French troops fighting with it.\nGaribaldi retired to his farm and died at the age of 75, honoured and mourned throughout the nation he had fought to free.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:310f4f3a-94d3-4a1c-a4e5-35da4e5c6665>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "As a general, he was fearless, commanding respect and loyalty from his men by fighting right alongside them in hand-to-hand combat. He was a man of action with an acute sense of justice and a childlike belief that good would triumph over immorality and corruption. He didn't want to win battles for politicians —he distrusted them. He was simply and truly out to smite evil. He was what most twelve-year-old boys want to be when they grow up, and if you ever have a strange dream in which you are beset by enemies and plagued by wrongdoers, and your dreammeister lets you choose whomever you want for help, take Garibaldi. Ask Cavour and Mazzini. They took him, and they didn't even like him. He was that good.\nThus, in May of 1860,\nFrancis II, King of the Two Sicilies had excellent\nreason to worry. Garibaldi, over the objections of the\nultra-cautious Cavour, had just smuggled a small and\nalmost unarmed (!) group of men out of the port of Genoa\naboard two leaky tubs and set off to liberate the\nItalian south. He would start in Sicily, in support of a\nlocal uprising, and work his way over to the mainland\nand on up to the capital, the city of Naples.

(Garibaldi set sail from\nGenoa on May 5 and landed in Sicily on May 11.)\nThe Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had a sizable army and the largest navy in the Mediterranean. Socially and politically, however, it had been standing still since the post-Napoleonic Restoration in 1815, surviving the Carbonari revolution of 1820 and successfully resisting calls for reform only by being propped up by the Austrian army and Swiss mercenaries. Many of the kingdom's liberals and intellectuals had left, and by 1860 even King Francis could sense what was coming. In June of that year (after Garibaldi had already taken Sicily!)", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:eaa452e5-71f7-4343-9c24-705988bd3b2d>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "he revived the constitution of 1848 and relinquished his absolute powers. There was even talk of an alliance between a liberalized Naples and the Piedmont kingdom of northern Italy, an Italian federation, of sorts. This, indeed, would have been a watered-down risorgimento, but it would have thwarted Garibaldi.\nEven northern politicians, primarily Cavour, while theoretically in favor of Italian unification, were aghast at the thought of a popular revolutionary army led by a thousand redshirted lunatics storming up the peninsula, spreading a message of instant universal brotherhood. Garibaldi, after all, in his youth had had to do with a mystic band of Christian communards, the St. Simonians, who, years before Karl Marx, had preached: From each according to his capacity; To each according to his works; The end of the exploitation of man by man; and The abolition of all privileges of birth.\nGaribaldi landed at\nMarsala and a few days later engaged a superior force\nnear Calatafimi. He threw caution to the winds (he\ndidn't have very much of it to begin with), said, \"Here\nwe either make Italy or die\", and led a ferocious\nbayonet charge uphill, literally overrunning the enemy.\nAnd that was more or less\nthat.

It is probably best to view Garibaldi's victory as resulting from a combination of factors. First, Garibaldi, himself, was a master of the hit-and-run harassing tactics that would one day become known as \"guerrilla warfare.\" He was also a firm believer in Napoleon's dictum that \"morale is to material as ten is to one\"—and his Redshirts had morale to burn.

They were miles ahead of the army. The king had fled to Gaeta the day before and the city and remaining troops welcomed the Risorgimento by giving Garibaldi a hero's welcome.\nA Bourbon force of about 20,000 troops had remained loyal to the king and gone north with him. Initially, the king had intended his retreat as somewhat of a strategic withdrawal. He had no intention of surrendering his kingdom without a fight.

Major revolutionary movements occurred in 1820 and 1848 against the Bourbon government with Sicily seeking independence; the second of which, the 1848 revolution resulted in a short period of independence for Sicily. However, in 1849 the Bourbons retook the control of the island and dominated it until 1860.\nIn 1860, as part of the Risorgimento, the Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Sicily. The conquest started at Marsala, and native Sicilians joined him in the capture of the southern Italian peninsula.

With his father's agreement he later went to sea and by the time he was 25 had worked his way from cabin boy to captain.\nIn 1832 came the turning point of Garibaldi's life, for he met another Italian, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was the organiser of the “Young Italy” movement. At this time Italy was made up of several separate states, many of which were ruled by kings who paid no attention to the wishes of their people. Great parts of what is now northern Italy belonged to Austria. The members of the “Young Italy” movement sought to drive out the Austrians, to unite all the states into one country and to set up one government for the whole country. They were determined to make that government democratic; that is, to have a government that would rule in accordance with the wishes of the people.\nIn 1834 Garibaldi helped Mazzini to organise a rebellion in Savoy (northem Italy). The attempt failed, Garibaldi fled to France, was sentenced to death in his absence and went to live in exile in South America. For 12 years he led a band of men who were fighting for the Republic of the Rio Grande, which was rebelling against Brazil.

He formed and fought with a volunteer army of 3,000 men, but after the Italians were defeated had to escape to Switzerland. In 1849 he was back in Italy, defending Rome against the French.

Garibaldi led the Italian republican drive for unification in southern Italy, but the northern Italian monarchy of the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia whose government was led by Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, also had the ambition of establishing a united Italian state. Though the kingdom had no physical connection to Rome (deemed the natural capital of Italy), the kingdom had successfully challenged Austria in the Second Italian War of Independence, liberatingLombardy-Venetia from Austrian rule. The kingdom also had established important alliances which helped it improve the possibility of Italian unification, such as Britain and France in the Crimean War.\nThe transition was not smooth for the south (the “Mezzogiorno“). The entire region south of Naples was afflicted with numerous deep economic and social liabilities.Transportation was difficult, soil fertility was low with extensive erosion, deforestation was severe, many businesses could stay open only because of high protective tariffs, large estates were often poorly managed, most peasant had only very small plots, there was chronic unemployment and high crime rates.\nCavour decided the basic problem was poor government, and believed that could be remedied by strict application of the Piedmonese legal system.

Returning to Europe in 1854, he settled on Caprera, a tiny island off Sardinia.\nIn 1859 Garibaldi was fighting the Austrians in north Italy once more, this time successfully. In May 1860, with 1,000 volunteers, he landed on the island of Sicily (off southern Italy) where the people were suffering under the brutal rule of King Francis of Naples. Within three months 25,000 of King Francis's troops were defeated, and Garibaldi led his men to the mainland of Italy, won the Battle of Reggio and marched on Naples. Francis fled and his kingdom of southern Italy was handed over to King Victor Emmanuel of Sardinia, who afterwards became King of the whole of Italy. Garibaldi, rejecting all offers of wealth and titles, returned to his simple farm on the island of Caprera.\nFrom there in 1862 he returned once more to raise an army and march on Rome, which was still a separate state ruled by the Pope. However, Victor Emmanuel did not want further strife and forced Garibaldi to stop. In 1867 he tried again and was defeated by the Pope's army, which had French troops fighting with it.\nGaribaldi retired to his farm and died at the age of 75, honoured and mourned throughout the nation he had fought to free.\n\nDocument 2: As a general, he was fearless, commanding respect and loyalty from his men by fighting right alongside them in hand-to-hand combat. He was a man of action with an acute sense of justice and a childlike belief that good would triumph over immorality and corruption. He didn't want to win battles for politicians —he distrusted them. He was simply and truly out to smite evil. He was what most twelve-year-old boys want to be when they grow up, and if you ever have a strange dream in which you are beset by enemies and plagued by wrongdoers, and your dreammeister lets you choose whomever you want for help, take Garibaldi. Ask Cavour and Mazzini. They took him, and they didn't even like him. He was that good.\nThus, in May of 1860,\nFrancis II, King of the Two Sicilies had excellent\nreason to worry. Garibaldi, over the objections of the\nultra-cautious Cavour, had just smuggled a small and\nalmost unarmed (!) group of men out of the port of Genoa\naboard two leaky tubs and set off to liberate the\nItalian south. He would start in Sicily, in support of a\nlocal uprising, and work his way over to the mainland\nand on up to the capital, the city of Naples. He cajoled\nand threatened weapons and ammunition out of the\ncommanders of a few armories along the way as he plodded\nsouth toward Sicily, where his famous \"Thousand\nredshirts\" (1,089, to be exact) would take on a regular\narmy twenty times that number. (Garibaldi set sail from\nGenoa on May 5 and landed in Sicily on May 11.)\nThe Kingdom of the Two Sicilies had a sizable army and the largest navy in the Mediterranean. Socially and politically, however, it had been standing still since the post-Napoleonic Restoration in 1815, surviving the Carbonari revolution of 1820 and successfully resisting calls for reform only by being propped up by the Austrian army and Swiss mercenaries. Many of the kingdom's liberals and intellectuals had left, and by 1860 even King Francis could sense what was coming. In June of that year (after Garibaldi had already taken Sicily!)\n\nDocument 3: he revived the constitution of 1848 and relinquished his absolute powers. There was even talk of an alliance between a liberalized Naples and the Piedmont kingdom of northern Italy, an Italian federation, of sorts. This, indeed, would have been a watered-down risorgimento, but it would have thwarted Garibaldi.\nEven northern politicians, primarily Cavour, while theoretically in favor of Italian unification, were aghast at the thought of a popular revolutionary army led by a thousand redshirted lunatics storming up the peninsula, spreading a message of instant universal brotherhood. Garibaldi, after all, in his youth had had to do with a mystic band of Christian communards, the St. Simonians, who, years before Karl Marx, had preached: From each according to his capacity; To each according to his works; The end of the exploitation of man by man; and The abolition of all privileges of birth.\nGaribaldi landed at\nMarsala and a few days later engaged a superior force\nnear Calatafimi. He threw caution to the winds (he\ndidn't have very much of it to begin with), said, \"Here\nwe either make Italy or die\", and led a ferocious\nbayonet charge uphill, literally overrunning the enemy.\nAnd that was more or less\nthat. Sicilian irregulars in rebellion against the royal\nforces had been watching the engagement from nearby\nhillsides. They liked what they saw. Soon Garibaldi's\nforces were swelled by a ragtag collection of rebels\narmed with guns, axes, clubs and whatever else could\nkill a Bourbon. Together they marched on Palermo and by\nceaseless guerrilla street fighting drove the Bourbon\ncommander into asking for an armistice, the only\ncondition being that royalist forces be allowed to leave\nthe island for the mainland.\nWith 3,500 men\nunder him, Garibaldi then crossed to the mainland on\nAugust 19 and started the 300-mile slog in the heat of\nsummer up towards Naples, his reputation preceding him\nby leaps and bounds. Peasants were already calling him\nthe \"Father of Italy,\" mothers brought their\nbabies out to be blessed by him, and there was an air of\nnatural invincibility about him as he moved north.\n\nDocument 4: They were typically aristocrats and business leaders, totally uninterested in democracy or in improving the lives of working people.\nAs a young man Garibaldi gravitated towards a secret movement known as La Giovine Italia, “Young Italy”. It was led by Giuseppe Mazzini. He believed in revolutionary action to unite Italy as a republic, rather than as a monarchy.\nHowever it is always difficult to build a mass movement under a dictatorship, and Garibaldi’s first experience of armed insurrection, in Genoa in 1834, was a dismal failure.\nThe following year Garibaldi moved to South America where he spent the next 13 years taking part in a variety of national liberation movements.\nWord of his exploits started to feed back to Italy and he acquired a reputation as the “hero of two worlds”.\nThe year 1848 was a turning point for popular struggle throughout Europe, as revolt after revolt broke out against hated rulers. This continent-wide uprising began in Sicily.\nKarl Marx noted at the time, “The bloody revolt of the people in Palermo affected the paralysed mass of the people like an electric shock and reawakened their great revolutionary memories and passions.”\nIn northern Italy the catalyst was revolution in Austria and the fall of its ruler, Prince Metternich. The Austrian army was occupying northern Italy and many began to desert. An uprising broke out in Milan four days after Metternich’s fall.\nPoor people and peasants supported this movement, since they suffered from conscription into the Austrian army – which landowners could pay to avoid – and had to pay heavy taxes to the Austrian empire.\nThe whole continent was soon in revolt. As Marx wrote, “Every postal delivery brought a fresh report of revolution, now from Italy, now from Germany, now from the remotest south east of Europe, and sustained the general intoxication of the people.”\nOne of the highest points in this revolutionary wave was the Roman Republic, proclaimed in Rome in January 1849.\nNot only did it oppose monarchy, it was also in favour of fair systems of taxation. It all looked similar to the French Revolution of 1789, right down to the planting of “trees of liberty”.\nIndeed there had been another revolution in France the previous June.\n\nDocument 5: There is much discussion even today about exactly how a relatively small band of Garibaldini, augmented at most by a few thousand irregulars picked up along the way, managed to make their way up the peninsula against what, at least on paper, appeared to be an overwhelmingly superior force. It is probably best to view Garibaldi's victory as resulting from a combination of factors. First, Garibaldi, himself, was a master of the hit-and-run harassing tactics that would one day become known as \"guerrilla warfare.\" He was also a firm believer in Napoleon's dictum that \"morale is to material as ten is to one\"—and his Redshirts had morale to burn. They were the righteous bringers of a new nation, and there is little doubt that large numbers of the long-suffering peasantry in Calabria and Puglia (perhaps less so as he moved further north towards Naples) genuinely viewed them as liberators.\nsituation in the Bourbon military also worked to\nGaribaldi's advantage. There was massive desertion among\nroyalist troops, many of whom felt that they were now\nbound up in defending a lost cause. Additionally, the\nofficer corps had been bitterly split for at least a\ndecade between old-guard royalists and those who felt\nthat the time for a united Italy had come at last.\nAll this, and more, combined to produce the unlikely sight, on September 7, 1860, of Giuseppe Garibaldi and a small group of companions entering Naples unopposed, by train (!) from Salerno and then in an open carriage from the station to the Royal Palace. They were miles ahead of the army. The king had fled to Gaeta the day before and the city and remaining troops welcomed the Risorgimento by giving Garibaldi a hero's welcome.\nA Bourbon force of about 20,000 troops had remained loyal to the king and gone north with him. Initially, the king had intended his retreat as somewhat of a strategic withdrawal. He had no intention of surrendering his kingdom without a fight. His army, near Gaeta, was, however, also being pressed from the north by the advancing army of King Victor Emanuel of Piedmont, who had finally decided to get on the bandwagon of unification before Garibaldi got all the credit.\n\nDocument 6: At first Sicily was able to remain as an independent kingdom under personal union, while the Bourbons ruled over both from Naples. However, the advent of Napoleon's First French Empire saw Naples taken at the Battle of Campo Tenese and Bonapartist Kings of Naples were instated. Ferdinand III the Bourbon was forced to retreat to Sicily which he was still in complete control of with the help of British naval protection.\nFollowing this Sicily joined the Napoleonic Wars, after the wars were won Sicily and Naples formally merged as the Two Sicilies under the Bourbons. Major revolutionary movements occurred in 1820 and 1848 against the Bourbon government with Sicily seeking independence; the second of which, the 1848 revolution resulted in a short period of independence for Sicily. However, in 1849 the Bourbons retook the control of the island and dominated it until 1860.\nIn 1860, as part of the Risorgimento, the Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe Garibaldi captured Sicily. The conquest started at Marsala, and native Sicilians joined him in the capture of the southern Italian peninsula. Garibaldi's march was finally completed with the Siege of Gaeta, where the final Bourbons were expelled and Garibaldi announced his dictatorship in the name of Victor Emmanuel II of Kingdom of Sardinia. Sicily became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia after a referendum where more than 75% of Sicily voted in favor of the annexation on 21 October 1860 (but not everyone was allowed to vote). As a result of the Kingdom of Italy proclamation, Sicily became part of the kingdom on 17 March 1861.\nAfter the Italian Unification, in spite of the strong investments made by the Kingdom of Italy in terms of modern infrastructure, the Sicilian (and the wider mezzogiorno) economy remained relatively underdeveloped and this caused an unprecedented wave of emigration. In 1894, organizations of workers and peasants known as the Fasci Siciliani, protested against the bad social and economic conditions of the island but they were suppressed in a few days. The Messina earthquake of 28 December 1908 killed over 80,000 people. This period was also characterised by the first contact between the Mafia, the Sicilian crime syndicate (also known as Cosa Nostra), and the Italian government.\n\nDocument 7: Giuseppe Garibaldi and The Creation of Italy. Rome today\nGiuseppe Garibaldi and his Achievements for Italy\nThe son of a seaman, he was born on July 4, 1807, in Nice, which is now in France but was then an Italian town. From his earliest years he loved adventure, and at the age of 15 tried to run away to sea. With his father's agreement he later went to sea and by the time he was 25 had worked his way from cabin boy to captain.\nIn 1832 came the turning point of Garibaldi's life, for he met another Italian, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was the organiser of the “Young Italy” movement. At this time Italy was made up of several separate states, many of which were ruled by kings who paid no attention to the wishes of their people. Great parts of what is now northern Italy belonged to Austria. The members of the “Young Italy” movement sought to drive out the Austrians, to unite all the states into one country and to set up one government for the whole country. They were determined to make that government democratic; that is, to have a government that would rule in accordance with the wishes of the people.\nIn 1834 Garibaldi helped Mazzini to organise a rebellion in Savoy (northem Italy). The attempt failed, Garibaldi fled to France, was sentenced to death in his absence and went to live in exile in South America. For 12 years he led a band of men who were fighting for the Republic of the Rio Grande, which was rebelling against Brazil. He suffered shipwreck, imprisonment and torture so bravely that his followers worshipped him. He organised other Italian exiles into an army known as the Italian Legion, which in 1843 and 1846 saved Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, from attack by Argentina.\nIn 1848 Garibaldi returned to Italy and found the north Italians in revolt against the Austrians. He formed and fought with a volunteer army of 3,000 men, but after the Italians were defeated had to escape to Switzerland. In 1849 he was back in Italy, defending Rome against the French. The people of Rome had rebelled against the government of the Pope (who at that time ruled over great areas in the same way as an ordinary king), and set up their own government.\n\nDocument 8: He spent fourteen years there, taking part in several wars, and returned to Italy in 1848.\nAfter the Revolutions of 1848, the apparent leader of the Italian unification movement was Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi. He was popular amongst southern Italians. Garibaldi led the Italian republican drive for unification in southern Italy, but the northern Italian monarchy of the House of Savoy in the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia whose government was led by Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour, also had the ambition of establishing a united Italian state. Though the kingdom had no physical connection to Rome (deemed the natural capital of Italy), the kingdom had successfully challenged Austria in the Second Italian War of Independence, liberatingLombardy-Venetia from Austrian rule. The kingdom also had established important alliances which helped it improve the possibility of Italian unification, such as Britain and France in the Crimean War.\nThe transition was not smooth for the south (the “Mezzogiorno“). The entire region south of Naples was afflicted with numerous deep economic and social liabilities.Transportation was difficult, soil fertility was low with extensive erosion, deforestation was severe, many businesses could stay open only because of high protective tariffs, large estates were often poorly managed, most peasant had only very small plots, there was chronic unemployment and high crime rates.\nCavour decided the basic problem was poor government, and believed that could be remedied by strict application of the Piedmonese legal system. The main result was an upsurge in brigandage, and a heavy outflow of millions of peasants in the Italian diaspora, especially to the United States and South America. Others relocated to the northern industrial cities such as Genoa, Milan and Turin, and sent money home.\nLiberal Italy (1861–1922)\nItaly became a nation-state belatedly—on 17 March 1861, when most of the states of the peninsula were united under king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, which ruled over Piedmont. The architects of Italian unification were Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, the Chief Minister of Victor Emmanuel, and Giuseppe Garibaldi, a general and national hero. In 1866 Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck offered Victor Emmanuel II an alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War. In exchange Prussia would allow Italy to annex Austrian-controlled Venice.\n\nDocument 9: Italian unification and Liberal Italy\nMain articles: Italian unification and Military history of Italy during World War I\nThe legendary \"handshake of Teano\" between Giuseppe Garibaldi and Victor Emmanuel II: on 26 October 1860, General Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy.\nThe creation of the Kingdom of Italy was the result of efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united state encompassing the entire Italian Peninsula. In the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful war was declared on Austria. The Kingdom of Sardinia again attacked the Austrian Empire in the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859, with the aid of France, resulting in liberating Lombardy.\nIn 1860–61, Giuseppe Garibaldi led the drive for unification in Naples and Sicily, allowing the Sardinian government led by the Count of Cavour to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861. In 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with Prussia during the Austro-Prussian War, waging the Third Italian War of Independence which allowed Italy to annex Venetia. Finally, as France during the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870 abandoned its garrisons in Rome, the Savoy rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the Papal States.\nItalian infantry at the Battle of Isonzo. More than 650,000 Italian soldiers lost their lives on the battlefields of World War I.\nThe Sardinian Albertine Statute of 1848, extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, provided for basic freedoms, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. As Northern Italy quickly industrialized, the South and rural areas of North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad, while the Italian Socialist Party constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.\nStarting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a colonial power by forcing Somalia, Eritrea and later Libya and the Dodecanese under its rule.\n\nDocument 10: The Coming of Garibaldi\nThe fall of the House of Bourbon and the Kingdom of Naples in 1860 is part of the success of the risorgimento, the movement to unite Italy into a single nation. This success is due primarily to three persons: a theoretician, a politician, and a soldier.\nThe theoretician, the ideologue, the one who preached national unity, was Giuseppe Mazzini (1805-72). He was not a particularly practical man, and he spent much of his life in exile, proclaiming from abroad the idea of Italian unity as a fulfillment of destiny, one which he apparently saw as a nebulous combination of ancient Italian glory and reasonable aspirations to modern nation-statehood.\nThe politician of the risorgimento,\nas shrewd as Metternich and Bismark, was Camillo\nBenzo Conte di Cavour (1810-61) prime minister of\nthe Kingdom of Piedmont. Northern Italy in the mid-1800s\nwas a patchwork. There was Piedmont, Lombardy, Modena,\nVenezia, the Papal States, etc. etc., each a sovereign\nstate. It was Cavour who had the political acumen to\nhandle the problem of northern unity before turning to\nthe greater one of unifying north and south. He was,\nhowever, a conservative and calculating man, one who\nfavored a gradual process of unification over\npolitician Cavour might have had his way if the soldier,\nGiuseppe Garibaldi (1807-82), as a young man in\nthe 1830s, had not wandered into a tavern where the\ntheoretician, Mazzini, was holding forth to fellow\nmembers of the revolutionary group, Young Italy.\nyou mean by Italy?\" asked one. \"The Kingdom of\nNaples? The Kingdom of Piedmont? The Duchy of\n\"I mean the new Italy… the united Italy of all the Italians,\" said Mazzini.\n\"At that point,\"\nrecalled Garibaldi in later years, \"I felt as Columbus\nmust have felt when he first sighted land.\"\nAs a pirate, patriot, soldier of fortune, lover and guerrilla fighter from Italy to South America, Garibaldi had a patent on the swashbuckle. He survived imprisonment, torture, severe wounds and exile.\n\nDocument 11: Giuseppe Garibaldi resigned his commission of leader of the army of Unification (I Mille) on September 18, 1860 and retired to his home on the island of Caprera off the coast of Sardinia. He was 53 years old and recovering from a battle wound.\nIn 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, Garibaldi was approached by a representative of the United States Government, reportedly on behalf of President Abraham Lincoln. The Union Army was in disarray and Lincoln was unhappy with those in command. He needed a proven military leader.\n“The offer came at a moment in Garibaldi’s life when he lived in semi-exile—too little of a politician to scheme for personal advancement, too much of a national idol to be put behind bars on the Italian mainland. The hero of the movement for a unified Italy, he had led a spectacularly successful revolt against a reactionary regime in Sicily and in Naples—the so-called Two Sicilies—in 1860, but now he was in temporary retirement.\nOn lonely Caprera, a wild, rocky island covered with juniper and myrtle and stunted olive trees, below La Maddalena off the northeastern corner of Sardinia, Garibaldi tended his vines and figs, built stone walls to fence in his goats, and looked out to the sea, dreaming. The conqueror of the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, in gray trousers and slouch hat, his red shirt and poncho flapping in the wind, refused all titles and honors for himself and sought only lenience for his followers. “How men are treated like oranges—squeezed dry and then cast aside!” he said.\nHe had wanted to march on Rome, against the “myrmidons of Napoleon in,” supposedly there to protect the pope, and defeat the Bourbon troops. But Victor Emmanuel II, king of Sardinia and now of Sicily and Naples as well, decided that French help was needed to complete unification of Italy and called off Garibaldi’s advance. Going back to Caprera, Garibaldi leaned against the steamer rail and said to his legion of Red Shirts: “Addio—a Roma!”\nAbraham Lincoln’s Offer\nThrough the letter, dated July 17, 1861, from Secretary of State William H. Seward to H.S.

But this indefatigable Kissinger of Italy also earned the well-deserved title of liar for all times.\nThe man who actually freed Italy and captured the imagination of Italians and Europeans alike was the native of Nice, Guiseppe Garibaldi (1807-1882). His contemporaries likened him to Spartan Leonidas, Roman Cincinnatus and American George Washington.\nBritain’s poet laureate Lord Tennyson, after planting a tree in his honor, movingly wrote:\nOr watch the waving pine which here\nThe warrior of Caprera set,\nA name that earth will not forget\nTill earth has roll’d her latest year—.\nLiberation movements used to command the attention of 19th century poets. At the dawn of 21st century, the bards have gone quiet, but the prose writers are busy conflating our desire to be free, alas, with selfishness.\nIn Italy, the decisive countdown for liberation started on May 5, 1860. With the help of Cavour, Garibaldi and his Mille (thousand) Redshirts sailed to Marsala in western Sicily with a hoodwinking from Great Britain.\nFour months later, all of Sicily and southern Italy were in the hands of 21 thousand Redshirts and Garibaldi. Italians were winning and those dying could finally say, as Leopardi wanted them to:\n“Beloved native land,\nthe life you gave me I give back to you.”\nTen years later—with a little bit of help from Germany, modern Italy was born.\nBut instead of focusing its energies on making Italians better patriots, it foolishly aspired to become an imperial power with fleeting forays into Eritrea, Somalia, Libya, Dodecanese Islands, and Ethiopia.\nUnheeded observation of Chancellor Bismarck was spot-on: “Italy has a large appetite but false teeth.”\nLeopardi, the Italian poet, can finally rest in peace. These days, Italians are not dying at the outskirts of Moscow from cold.\n\nDocument 14: Thus hemmed in, the Bourbons made a desperate effort in early October to break out and retake their kingdom by storming south at the Volturno River. Garibaldi was called upon for one of the few times in his life to fight a pitched battle instead of one of his guerrilla actions, and to defend instead of attack. He commanded troops along a twenty-kilometer front against a superior attacking force and held.\nOn October 25th, near\nCapua, Garibaldi greeted Victor Emanuel of Piedmont's\nRoyal House of Savoy with the words, \"Greetings to the\nfirst King of Italy\" and surrendered his conquests\n—Sicily, half the Italian peninsula and the vast\nNeapolitan Royal Navy (considerably superior to northern\nItalian fleets of the time) —without the slightest\nhesitation or thought of reward for himself, simply\nbecause it was the right thing to do.\nFor their efforts,\nGaribaldi and his superb men were completely and utterly\nsnubbed by the new rulers of Italy. The egalitarian\ninitiatives such as free education and land reform that\nGaribaldi had set up during his brief reign as \"Dictator\nof Naples\" were revoked, provoking for another\ndecade in much of the south what almost amounted to a civil war as recently liberated\nsubjects of the Bourbons took to the hills to escape\ntheir liberators from the north.\nlike the way things had turned out, but figured it was\njust more injustice he would have to straighten out when\nhe got around to it. He spent the last twenty years of\nhis life actively trying to do just that in one way or\nanother, in one place or another. He would fight more battles,\nbe arrested and imprisoned (he escaped) and even be\nelected to parliament. He didn't have a political bone\nin his body, and he continued to be saddened and\nconfounded by the politics of those who refused to do\nthe right thing. The Kingdom of Naples, which Garibaldi\nhad handed to Victor Emanuel on a silver platter, was\nofficially dissolved on Oct. 22, 1860, when Neapolitans\nvoted by plebiscite to become part of Mazzini's \"new\nItaly…united for all Italians\".\n\nQuestion: What was the purpose of the uprising in Italy in 1861 led by Garibaldi and his thousand men?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Garibaldi and his thousand men, known as the Redshirts, aimed to liberate the Italian south, particularly Sicily and southern Italy, from the rule of King Francis II of Naples, who was part of the Bourbon dynasty. Their purpose was to unite the Italian peninsula under a single government, as part of the broader Risorgimento movement for Italian unification. Garibaldi's expedition was successful in capturing Sicily and advancing to the mainland, ultimately leading to the fall of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and paving the way for the establishment of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861. This uprising was a pivotal moment in Italian history, marking a significant step towards national unity and independence."}

Whaaaa? July 6, 2012Posted by gordonwatts in ATLAS, CMS, Higgs, LHC, physics, press.\nOk. This post is for all my non-physics friends who have been asking me… What just happened? Why is everyone talking about this Higgs thing!?\nIt does what!?\nActually, two things. It gives fundamental particles mass. Not much help, eh? Fundamental particles are, well, fundamental – the most basic things in nature. We are made out of arms & legs and a few other bits. Arms & legs and everything else are made out of cells. Cells are made out of molecules. Molecules are made out of atoms. Note we’ve not reached anything fundamental yet – we can keep peeling back the layers of the onion and peer inside. Inside the atom are electrons in a cloud around the nucleus. Yes! We’ve got a first fundamental particle: the electron! Everything we’ve done up to now says it stops with the electron. There is nothing inside it. It is a fundamental particle.\nWe aren’t done with the nucleus yet, however. Pop that open and you’ll find protons and neutrons. Not even those guys are fundamental, however – inside each of them you’ll find quarks – about 3 of them. Two “up” quarks and a “down” quark in the case of the proton and one “up” quark and two “down” quarks in the case of the neutron. Those quarks are fundamental particles.\nThe Higgs interacts with the electron and the quarks and gives them mass. You could say it “generates” the mass. I’m tempted to say that without the Higgs those fundamental particles wouldn’t have mass. So, there you have it. This is one of its roles. Without this Higgs, we would not understand at all how electrons and quarks have mass, and we wouldn’t understand how to correctly calculate the mass of an atom!\nNow, any physicist who has made it this far is cringing with my last statement – as a quick reading of it implies that all the mass of an atom comes from the Higgs. It turns out that we know of several different ways that mass can be “generated” – and the Higgs is just one of them.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:1a34a708-8d26-4c88-8be4-b8035e6c6874>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "On July 4, 2012, scientists at Switzerland’s CERN made an announcement that involved an altogether different kind of fireworks, i.e., the kind of fireworks that one gets when smashing protons into each other at nearly the speed of light. After close to forty years of theorizing, analyzing, and searching — and yes, smashing protons — the scientists announced that they were 99.9999% certain that they had discovered the elusive Higgs Boson. Considered by many in the scientific community to be one of the greatest discoveries in recent memory, it’s probably safe to say that the event has flown right over the heads of most people (as indicated by this video of Brooklyn hipsters trying to explain what the Higgs Boson is).\nSo what, exactly, is the significance of the Higgs Boson? To understand that, you need to know a little bit about the Standard Model in physics. For decades, scientists have been trying to figure out just what, exactly, makes up the world around us. If you’ll recall your high school physics class, all matter is made up of atoms, which in turn consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Dig deeper, though, and you find that protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called quarks. The Standard Model is, in part, an attempt to list all of these subatomic building blocks, along with neutrinos and photons (to name a few), with the goal being nothing less than a catalog of the very building blocks of nature.\nHowever, for years, the Standard Model was missing one key particle: the Higgs Boson. The Higgs Boson is particularly important because it is associated with the Higgs Field, a field of energy that, so goes the theory, permeates the universe and determines the mass of the other particles when they interact with it. Without proof of the Higgs Boson’s existence — or something very much like it — scientists are at a loss when it comes to understanding one of the universe’s most basic aspects: why particles have the mass that they do. Discovering the Higgs Boson, and how it interacts with all of the other particles, gives scientists an even deeper understanding of how the universe functions at a most fundamental level.\nThe Higgs Boson’s existence was predicted back in 1964, but it has never been observed.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:03195137-8fee-4aea-9aa9-7764bd9b9f77>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "There's only, you know, a handful of elementary particles that we're all made of, and each one has a specific electric charge, a specific interaction with a strong nuclear force and with gravity and also a certain mass.\nAnd it turns out that if you look at the theories of physics that we have, that was such a success, they have so much symmetry built into them that there's an implication, namely that all of the particles they describe should be massless, should have exactly zero mass.\nAnd that implication is patently false. So you need to do something about it. And in 1964, the year The Beatles came to America, a handful of physicists figured out a way to fix that problem, by introducing a new field into nature, a field who breaks the symmetry that is built into particle physics and by breaking that symmetry allows all the other particles to get mass.\nThat field is the Higgs field, and the vibrations in that field give us the Higgs boson.\nFLATOW: So the experiments at CERN were able to sort of ring that field, shock the field, and out pops a Higgs?\nCARROLL: That's exactly right, and in fact, that's how you make all particles in particle physics. The photon, the particle of light, is a wave in the electromagnetic field. And even things that we really think of as particles, not fields, like the electron or the up quark, these are still fields. This is just the lesson of 20th-century physics is that the world is described by quantum field theory.\nSo it's the Higgs field that is doing the work, giving mass to all the other particles, but it's the Higgs boson which is a vibration in that field that lets us tell the Higgs field is there.\nFLATOW: So could you ring the gravitational field and have a gravity thing pop out?\nCARROLL: Absolutely.

Here's hoping I've posted in the right place.... I'm basically trying to understand the difference between energy and matter and how one can become the other. Please bear with me, I'm a total layman and can't seem to get a definitive answer anywhere online. So I guess I get the basics: Matter is made up of atoms which are made up of subatomic particles. But the added mass of the individual particles doesn't add up to the total mass of the atom. The remaining mass is made up of energy. The energy that was needed to bind the particles into a nucleus is converted into mass when the strong force takes over from the EM force. Which means that matter is partly converted energy.... But what about the particles that make up the atom? Were the protons, electrons and neutrons matter before they became bound together? Or were these particles themselves energy to begin with? The reason I'm confused is because free electrons are supposed to be electrical energy, not matter. And, seeing as photons are free moving and they are energy, I'm assuming that subatomic particles are energy until they are bound into an atom, making them matter.....?

After going through their entire data set from 2012, the results \"strongly indicate\" they have found the elusive particle.\n'Touches every other particle’\nFirst theorized almost 50 years ago by British physicist Peter Higgs and others, the Higgs boson is the only particle yet to be observed in the Standard Model of Physics, which basically explains how the basic building blocks of matter interact.\n\"The Higgs field is everywhere around us, and all particles are moving in the presence of this field,\" said William Trischuk, a professor of physics at the University of Toronto. All these particles \"interact more or less strongly with it, and they are either slowed down or not slowed down so much and that's what gives them mass.\"\n\"The heavier ones interact strongly with this field and the light ones interact very weakly with this field.\"\nTrischuk is part of the ATLAS collaboration, which is one of two experiments seeking out the Higgs using the Large Hadron Collider.\n\"We hate calling it the God particle but the reason it picked that up is because it goes out and touches every other particle and gives them their property, which is their mass,\" Trischuk said.\nStill, while the Higgs boson is fundamental to the universe itself, it's unclear what impact this discovery will have on the average person, DiStefano said.\n\"I don’t think that anyone can guarantee what type of outcome on any time scale,\" he said.\n\nDocument 2: There is renewed excitement in the world of physics dealing with the search for the elusive Higgs boson, otherwise referred to as the \"God particle.\"\nPhysicists from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., claim to have found new evidence that could lead to the Higgs boson.

Through this process scientists are, in simple terms, able to retrace exactly what occurred during the collision and follow any particles that may deviate from what was expected to happen.\n\nDocument 3: There's only, you know, a handful of elementary particles that we're all made of, and each one has a specific electric charge, a specific interaction with a strong nuclear force and with gravity and also a certain mass.\nAnd it turns out that if you look at the theories of physics that we have, that was such a success, they have so much symmetry built into them that there's an implication, namely that all of the particles they describe should be massless, should have exactly zero mass.\nAnd that implication is patently false. So you need to do something about it. And in 1964, the year The Beatles came to America, a handful of physicists figured out a way to fix that problem, by introducing a new field into nature, a field who breaks the symmetry that is built into particle physics and by breaking that symmetry allows all the other particles to get mass.\nThat field is the Higgs field, and the vibrations in that field give us the Higgs boson.\nFLATOW: So the experiments at CERN were able to sort of ring that field, shock the field, and out pops a Higgs?\nCARROLL: That's exactly right, and in fact, that's how you make all particles in particle physics. The photon, the particle of light, is a wave in the electromagnetic field. And even things that we really think of as particles, not fields, like the electron or the up quark, these are still fields. This is just the lesson of 20th-century physics is that the world is described by quantum field theory.\nSo it's the Higgs field that is doing the work, giving mass to all the other particles, but it's the Higgs boson which is a vibration in that field that lets us tell the Higgs field is there.\nFLATOW: So could you ring the gravitational field and have a gravity thing pop out?\nCARROLL: Absolutely. I mean, at Cal Tech, we're very interested in trying to do that, and the thing is that gravity is such a weak force that you're never going to detect an individual graviton, a particle of gravity. What you could do is detect the combination of a gajillion(ph) gravitons that makes up a gravitational wave, and that's an ongoing project, looking for gravitational radiation from astrophysical sources.\nFLATOW: That's an interesting project.\n\nDocument 4: The Higgs. Whaaaa? July 6, 2012Posted by gordonwatts in ATLAS, CMS, Higgs, LHC, physics, press.\nOk. This post is for all my non-physics friends who have been asking me… What just happened? Why is everyone talking about this Higgs thing!?\nIt does what!?\nActually, two things. It gives fundamental particles mass. Not much help, eh? Fundamental particles are, well, fundamental – the most basic things in nature. We are made out of arms & legs and a few other bits. Arms & legs and everything else are made out of cells. Cells are made out of molecules. Molecules are made out of atoms. Note we’ve not reached anything fundamental yet – we can keep peeling back the layers of the onion and peer inside. Inside the atom are electrons in a cloud around the nucleus. Yes! We’ve got a first fundamental particle: the electron! Everything we’ve done up to now says it stops with the electron. There is nothing inside it. It is a fundamental particle.\nWe aren’t done with the nucleus yet, however. Pop that open and you’ll find protons and neutrons. Not even those guys are fundamental, however – inside each of them you’ll find quarks – about 3 of them. Two “up” quarks and a “down” quark in the case of the proton and one “up” quark and two “down” quarks in the case of the neutron. Those quarks are fundamental particles.\nThe Higgs interacts with the electron and the quarks and gives them mass. You could say it “generates” the mass. I’m tempted to say that without the Higgs those fundamental particles wouldn’t have mass. So, there you have it. This is one of its roles. Without this Higgs, we would not understand at all how electrons and quarks have mass, and we wouldn’t understand how to correctly calculate the mass of an atom!\nNow, any physicist who has made it this far is cringing with my last statement – as a quick reading of it implies that all the mass of an atom comes from the Higgs. It turns out that we know of several different ways that mass can be “generated” – and the Higgs is just one of them.\n\nDocument 5: On July 4, 2012, scientists at Switzerland’s CERN made an announcement that involved an altogether different kind of fireworks, i.e., the kind of fireworks that one gets when smashing protons into each other at nearly the speed of light. After close to forty years of theorizing, analyzing, and searching — and yes, smashing protons — the scientists announced that they were 99.9999% certain that they had discovered the elusive Higgs Boson. Considered by many in the scientific community to be one of the greatest discoveries in recent memory, it’s probably safe to say that the event has flown right over the heads of most people (as indicated by this video of Brooklyn hipsters trying to explain what the Higgs Boson is).\nSo what, exactly, is the significance of the Higgs Boson? To understand that, you need to know a little bit about the Standard Model in physics. For decades, scientists have been trying to figure out just what, exactly, makes up the world around us. If you’ll recall your high school physics class, all matter is made up of atoms, which in turn consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons. Dig deeper, though, and you find that protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called quarks. The Standard Model is, in part, an attempt to list all of these subatomic building blocks, along with neutrinos and photons (to name a few), with the goal being nothing less than a catalog of the very building blocks of nature.\nHowever, for years, the Standard Model was missing one key particle: the Higgs Boson. The Higgs Boson is particularly important because it is associated with the Higgs Field, a field of energy that, so goes the theory, permeates the universe and determines the mass of the other particles when they interact with it. Without proof of the Higgs Boson’s existence — or something very much like it — scientists are at a loss when it comes to understanding one of the universe’s most basic aspects: why particles have the mass that they do. Discovering the Higgs Boson, and how it interacts with all of the other particles, gives scientists an even deeper understanding of how the universe functions at a most fundamental level.\nThe Higgs Boson’s existence was predicted back in 1964, but it has never been observed.\n\nDocument 6: It is called “relativity” because measurements of space and time were found to be relative to the observer’s velocity, and not independent of velocity as had been previously thought. Also, there is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles at very small scales. This is called “quantum physics” because energy levels under certain conditions are “quantized” (falling into discrete quantities such as 1 and 2 with no values in between such as 1.5). However, at the moment, there is no branch of physics that can deal with both situations simultaneously (except under certain nuanced exceptions). Namely, we cannot know what will happen when very small particles interact at very high energies. However, several models exist which have made predictions about what will happen. The LHC will allow scientists to test competing models.\nOne problem in particular is the question of what gives particles their mass. Photons (particles of light) have no intrinsic mass.

Therefore, despite hyped media reporting, the LHC cannot (even in principle) demonstrate that the big bang happened. It may, however, give us some interesting insight into how God upholds His universe today.\n\nDocument 7: Presenter: Brain Cox works on the Large Hadron Collider that's about to become operational at CERN.\nAim of particle physics is to find out what everything is made of. As you get back to the early times of the universe, things were simpler. In the 1st billionth of a second it was very simple. Everything was made from 12 particles of matter stuck together by four forces. \"All science is either physics or stamp collecting.\" - Ernest Rutherford\nLarge Hadron collider is 27 Km in circumference and will accelerates protons to 99.99999% the speed of light (I might not have gotten the right number of 9s, sorry if this spoils your calculations if you are trying this at home). These will collide with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction.\nHiggs gives mass to fundamental particles. Particles are massive because they are surrounded by Higgs particles. (Maggie Thatcher shown here surround by a Higgs field). The LHC will hopefully verify the existence of Higgs particles. If not, it'll find whatever is responsible for giving mass to stuff.\nWhat particle physics means to me: gives modern science a creation story. We know universe beAgn 13.7 billion years ago as a dot smaller than an atom. Universe underwent exponential expansion in a billionth of a second and continues to expand. AFter 400 million years, the first stars formed and other elements were cooked in them. On some planets oxygen and hydrogen formed into water, liquid water on some planets. On at least one planet, life formed.\n\nDocument 8: well i am trying to understand the basic of mass and i got myself into a deadlock of questions firstly the definition of mass as i know is :quantitative measure of an object's resistance to the change of its speed. assumption:particle have charge but no mass and they just fall into the significant field of each other,there is nothing they interact with except each other and a force F. now consider a situation where a particle with charge say -q comes into significant field influence of another particle with charge +Q,it then follow a particular path P,suppose a force F is used to the bring a change in path of -q,the force F does so in two ways:at first it tries to change the path of -q by change it's state of motion(either by accelerating or deceleration him) ,thus the resistance offered to F relative to him appeared because of the electromagnetic interaction between the charges. In the second case the force F tries to change the trajectory of -q but by not changing it's state of motion(maintaining it's velocity),in this case also the resistance offered was due to the electromagnetic interaction. so according to the definition of mass the resistance offered in first scenario should add to mass but not second,though it can be clearly seen that the resistance offered is because of the electromagnetic interaction under action. SO WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE PICTURE DEPICTED?\n\nDocument 9: How does the material world exist if the fundamental building blocks of matter have no mass?

Matter appeared, and literally leaked, out of the vacuum...everywhere there was space and time.\nReturn toAsk the Astronomer\n\nDocument 13: Hi, I'm new both to this forum and to physics in general. Here's hoping I've posted in the right place.... I'm basically trying to understand the difference between energy and matter and how one can become the other. Please bear with me, I'm a total layman and can't seem to get a definitive answer anywhere online. So I guess I get the basics: Matter is made up of atoms which are made up of subatomic particles. But the added mass of the individual particles doesn't add up to the total mass of the atom. The remaining mass is made up of energy. The energy that was needed to bind the particles into a nucleus is converted into mass when the strong force takes over from the EM force. Which means that matter is partly converted energy.... But what about the particles that make up the atom? Were the protons, electrons and neutrons matter before they became bound together? Or were these particles themselves energy to begin with? The reason I'm confused is because free electrons are supposed to be electrical energy, not matter. And, seeing as photons are free moving and they are energy, I'm assuming that subatomic particles are energy until they are bound into an atom, making them matter.....? So essentially I'm asking, are protons, electrons and neutrons always matter, or can they be energy as well? Sorry if this is a dumb question. I'm certainly no physicist, just curious.\n\nDocument 14: Subatomic mass en\nThe mass of a subatomic particle, including its uncertainty, in units of MeV/c².\nWhat are Properties?

The Higgs field, which permeates the universe, interacts with particles, and this interaction is what gives them mass. This concept was first theorized by British physicist Peter Higgs and others almost 50 years ago, and its discovery was announced in 2012 by scientists at CERN. The Higgs boson is sometimes referred to as the \"God particle\" because it interacts with all other particles and gives them their mass.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that while the Higgs boson plays a crucial role in explaining mass, it is not the only mechanism. There are other ways mass can be generated, and the Higgs mechanism is just one of them. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been instrumental in the search for the Higgs boson, as it allows scientists to test theories and models about the fundamental nature of particles and their interactions.\n\nIn summary, the Higgs boson and the Higgs field are central to the explanation of particle mass within the Standard Model, but the full understanding of mass generation in the universe is still an area of active research."}

American engines have all been fuel-rich. Some Soviet engines have been oxidizer-rich.\nAdditionally, there is a difference between mixture ratios for optimum Isp and optimum thrust. During launch, shortly after takeoff, high thrust is at a premium. This can be achieved at some temporary reduction of Isp by increasing the oxidiser ratio initially, and then transitioning to more fuel-rich mixtures. Since engine size is typically scaled for takeoff thrust this permits reduction of the weight of rocket engine, pipes and pumps and the extra propellant use can be more than compensated by increases of acceleration towards the end of the burn by having a reduced dry mass.\nAlthough liquid hydrogen gives a high Isp, its low density is a significant disadvantage: hydrogen occupies about 7x more volume per kilogram than dense fuels such as kerosene. This not only penalises the tankage, but also the pipes and fuel pumps leading from the tank, which need to be 7x bigger and heavier. (The oxidiser side of the engine and tankage is of course unaffected.) This makes the vehicle's dry mass much higher, so the use of liquid hydrogen is not such a big win as might be expected. Indeed, some dense hydrocarbon/LOX propellant combinations have higher performance when the dry mass penalties are included.\nDue to lower Isp, dense propellant launch vehicles have a higher takeoff mass, but this does not mean a proportionately high cost; on the contrary, the vehicle may well end up cheaper. Liquid hydrogen is quite an expensive fuel to produce and store, and causes many practical difficulties with design and manufacture of the vehicle.\nBecause of the higher overall weight, a dense-fuelled launch vehicle necessarily requires higher takeoff thrust, but it carries this thrust capability all the way to orbit. This, in combination with the better thrust/weight ratios, means that dense-fuelled vehicles reach orbit earlier, thereby minimizing losses due to gravity drag. Thus, the effective delta-v requirement for these vehicles are reduced.\nHowever, liquid hydrogen does give clear advantages when the overall mass needs to be minimised; for example the Saturn V vehicle used it on the upper stages; this reduced weight meant that the dense-fuelled first stage could be made significantly smaller, saving quite a lot of money.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:4a263315-3d92-4091-a362-de6cc6e15b86>::chunk-7"]}, {"passage": "The DeltaWing Racing Car is a radical proposal for a new type of vehicle for the 2012 IndyCar racing series.DeltaWing LLC, of Indianapolis, introduced the concept at the 2010 Chicago Auto Show.

Typically, a search engine measures the pilot signal strength at all possible PN offsets, proceeding at a measurement rate that produces an accurate measure of the pilot signal present at the corresponding offset. Proceeding in this manner, the search engine determines the PN offset of base stations which are geographically near the remote unit. Searching each PN offset in this manner can take anywhere from hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds depending on the channel conditions during acquisition. This amount of time for the remote unit to reacquire a pilot signal is detrimental to the remote unit operation, and may be annoying to the user of the remote unit.\nOne purpose of the search engine, as described above, is to aid in maintaining the wireless link between the remote unit and a base station.

American engines have all been fuel-rich. Some Soviet engines have been oxidizer-rich.\nAdditionally, there is a difference between mixture ratios for optimum Isp and optimum thrust. During launch, shortly after takeoff, high thrust is at a premium. This can be achieved at some temporary reduction of Isp by increasing the oxidiser ratio initially, and then transitioning to more fuel-rich mixtures. Since engine size is typically scaled for takeoff thrust this permits reduction of the weight of rocket engine, pipes and pumps and the extra propellant use can be more than compensated by increases of acceleration towards the end of the burn by having a reduced dry mass.\nAlthough liquid hydrogen gives a high Isp, its low density is a significant disadvantage: hydrogen occupies about 7x more volume per kilogram than dense fuels such as kerosene. This not only penalises the tankage, but also the pipes and fuel pumps leading from the tank, which need to be 7x bigger and heavier. (The oxidiser side of the engine and tankage is of course unaffected.) This makes the vehicle's dry mass much higher, so the use of liquid hydrogen is not such a big win as might be expected. Indeed, some dense hydrocarbon/LOX propellant combinations have higher performance when the dry mass penalties are included.\nDue to lower Isp, dense propellant launch vehicles have a higher takeoff mass, but this does not mean a proportionately high cost; on the contrary, the vehicle may well end up cheaper. Liquid hydrogen is quite an expensive fuel to produce and store, and causes many practical difficulties with design and manufacture of the vehicle.\nBecause of the higher overall weight, a dense-fuelled launch vehicle necessarily requires higher takeoff thrust, but it carries this thrust capability all the way to orbit. This, in combination with the better thrust/weight ratios, means that dense-fuelled vehicles reach orbit earlier, thereby minimizing losses due to gravity drag. Thus, the effective delta-v requirement for these vehicles are reduced.\nHowever, liquid hydrogen does give clear advantages when the overall mass needs to be minimised; for example the Saturn V vehicle used it on the upper stages; this reduced weight meant that the dense-fuelled first stage could be made significantly smaller, saving quite a lot of money.\n\nDocument 6: The DeltaWing Racing Car is a radical proposal for a new type of vehicle for the 2012 IndyCar racing series.DeltaWing LLC, of Indianapolis, introduced the concept at the 2010 Chicago Auto Show. During the unveiling, Dan Partel, Chief Executive Officer of DeltaWing LLC said of the vehicle; \"Today marks a fundamental shift in how race fans and the general public will view all racing cars in the future; this is a game changer. This radical prototype takes open wheel racing to a new level from both an engineering standpoint and the overall spectator experience.\"\n31st July 2010. Amazingly the title for the Worlds Fastest Helicopter has stood since the mid-1980s. The previous record of 249 mph was held by a British Army Westland Lynx helicopter. As it stands at the moment, the Sikorsky X2's maximum recorded speed is 258 mph, but it's an unofficial top speed. To claim the official Guinness title they'll need to repeat the high-speed run with Guinness officials and their timing gear present.\nThere are two different types of remote control aircraft. There are those made by hobby fliers just for the fun of it. And then there are multi-million dollar remotely piloted aircraft developed by huge aerospace companies. The Boeing X-48B, quite obviously, falls into the latter category. The X-48B has a 6.4 meter (21 foot) wingspan, and weighs in at 230 kgs (500 lbs). Power comes from three turbojet engines mounted at the rear of the aircraft. It can fly at up to 136 mph (220 km/h), and reach an altitude of 3,000 meters (10,000 feet).

For the higher powered version maximum power is 184 hp at 3800 rpm while maximum torque of 400 Nm is achieved at just 2000 rpm; the second version has a maximum engine power of 163 hp at 3800 and torque of 350 Nm at 2000 rpm.\nPerformance figures for the new Captiva using the lower output 163 hp engine and manual gearbox are a 0-100 km/h time of 9.9 seconds and maximum speed of 189 km/h, while for the 184 hp version 0 to 100 km/h is 9.4 seconds while it can reach a maximum speed of 200 km/h.\nIn-gear acceleration times are an impressive 9.6 and 11.6 seconds respectively, between 80 and 120 km/h in 5th gear.\nFuel consumption for both versions on a combined cycle is an identical 6.4 liter/100 km. Emissions are also identical at 170 g/km.\nManual or automatic - it's six-speed all round\nComplementing Chevrolet Captiva's new powertrains is a new six-speed automatic transmission. The new auto box can be used in full automatic mode, or if the driver prefers, Driver Shift Control (DSC) allows for manual shifting when the mood takes.\nTwo versions of the new automatic transmission have been developed, one to be mated with gasoline and all-wheel drive offerings and the other with the diesel engines, as each is designed to handle different levels of engine torque. Automatic is available as an option on all engines and comes as standard with the 3.0L DI VVT V6.\nOne of the great advantages of the new automatic is that it has enabled much more compact packaging than previously, as the entire powertrain unit is now much shorter fore-to-aft. This allowed the engineers to enhance crumple zones, increase interior space and lower the hood line.\nThe new automatic has been engineered with a wide spread of gear ratios to optimize the correlation between performance and fuel economy. So while first gear is 'steep' to enable fast take-off, a tall sixth gear lowers engine revs at higher speeds, maximizing fuel and reducing internal noise and vibration.\n\nDocument 13: Delta V: 2 m/s\n260 km X 345 km orbit to 265 km X 368 km orbit.

According to IS-95 operation, the base stations continually transmit the pilot signal which can be used by the remote unit to identify the base station as well as other functions, such as for example, determining the multipath environment the remote unit is operating in and synchronization of remote unit timing to the base station timing.\nDuring initial power on, or any other situation when the remote unit has lost a pilot signal such as when performing a hard hand-off to a different operating frequency, the remote unit evaluates all possible PN offsets of the pilot PN sequence. Typically, a search engine measures the pilot signal strength at all possible PN offsets, proceeding at a measurement rate that produces an accurate measure of the pilot signal present at the corresponding offset. Proceeding in this manner, the search engine determines the PN offset of base stations which are geographically near the remote unit. Searching each PN offset in this manner can take anywhere from hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds depending on the channel conditions during acquisition. This amount of time for the remote unit to reacquire a pilot signal is detrimental to the remote unit operation, and may be annoying to the user of the remote unit.\nOne purpose of the search engine, as described above, is to aid in maintaining the wireless link between the remote unit and a base station. Because the wireless channel is constantly changing, multi-path searching must be performed on a virtually continuous basis, otherwise the wireless link may be lost due to, for example, fading. If the wireless link is lost, communications between the remote unit and the base station are terminated and the remote unit performs a search of the entire PN space to reacquire an appropriate base station. Searching the entire PN space consumes an excessive amount of time.\nTherefore, there is a need in the art for a method of and apparatus to minimize the amount of time required for a remote unit, in a wireless communication system, to acquire or reacquire a pilot signal.\nThe invention increases the speed of acquisition, or reacquisition, of a pilot signal in a wireless communication system. The wireless communication system comprises a plurality of base stations, each configured to transmit a PN encoded pilot signal at a different time offset than the other base stations.\n\nDocument 15: While the maximum speed limit goes from 250 km / ha of 350 km / h.\nThe German tuner has used a T65 RS engine conversion including ECU software, new manifolds with integrated turbine housings with high performance turbochargers four inter coolers water-air system and a stainless steel exhaust.

According to this calculation, the simplified equation for maximum Δv is:\nΔv = 21.576745349086 * Isp\nSubstituting the given ISP value:\nΔv = 21.576745349086 * 350 seconds\nΔv = 7551.8608721801 m/s\nTherefore, the maximum delta-v that can be achieved with an engine that has an ISP of 350 seconds is approximately 7551.86 m/s.\n\nThis calculation assumes ideal conditions and does not account for factors such as atmospheric drag, gravity losses, or the mass of the spacecraft itself. In practical scenarios, the actual Δv achievable would be less due to these factors."}

His band, Bill Haley & His Comets performed Rock Around the Clock for the movie, Blackboard Jungle in 1955. The movie itself wasn't memorable, but the song was, although it was only heard in the background in opening and closing credits. Part of reason was that the song was \"new.\" It had a faster rhythm compared to the conventional blues, and a rebellious sound. Most importantly it was sung by a White guy.\nRock Around the Clock became very popular. It enjoyed widespread attention and billboard chart success. The song was favorable among White and Black audiences alike - especially White teenagers. This was the definitive start of the mainstream rock n' roll scene.\nAlthough the song was a massive hit, Bill Haley couldn't prolong his success because he was too old. He didn't fulfill the needs of record companies that were looking forward to reach-out to the massive White teenagers who had enough money in hand to buy songs. This opened door for other rock n' roll artists like Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. From 1955 to 1959, rock n' roll was more popular than rhythm & blues and country music.\nRacial tensions were still high in the US in 1950s. Classrooms were segregated; Black kids went to night school. Therefore the arrival of rock n' roll wasn't greatly appreciated by White adults, presumably parents. They saw it as a threat to their way of life since music would somehow integrate both White and Black communities together. As a matter of fact, the title Blackboard Jungle has a slight racial tone to it. Elvis was the most prominent artist at the time as he was the only one signed to a major record label. When he appeared on TV to perform Hound Dog, his legs were cut off from TV due \"inappropriate movements.\" In other words, he was White but danced like a Black guy. As far as the parents concerned, such behavior \"crossed the line.\"\nThere were also Black Rock N' Rollers. Chuck Berry was the best example. He was the Black guy who sang like a White guy.

He was 79. According to The New York Times, Lytle died of lung cancer.\nLytle was a teenage guitar player working at a Chester, Pennsylvania, radio station when Haley, who worked at another station, recruited him to play bass. Lytle notably didn't play the instrument, but Haley taught him the rudiments of slap-bass in a 30-minute session. The technique was key for country music, which was the focus of Haley's band – then known as Bill Haley and His Saddlemen.\n\"He got this old bass fiddle out, started slapping it, with a shuffle beat, and showed me the basic three notes you need on a little bass run to get started with,\" Lytle said in a 2011 radio interview. \"I gave it a try and I said, 'Hell, I can do that.'\"\nHaley's band changed their name to Bill Haley and the Comets in 1952, and Lytle played on memorable tracks including \"Crazy, Man, Crazy\" and \"Shake, Rattle and Roll.\" The bassist developed a lively stage presence, throwing his bass into the air, lifting it over his shoulder and riding it like a horse. The group landed their biggest hit in 1955 after a version of their classic recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" appeared in the opening credits of the movie Blackboard Jungle.\nLytle and two other band members left Bill Haley and the Comets in 1955 after a salary dispute, branching off into their own group, the Jodimars. The band would become a popular Las Vegas lounge act. Lytle changed his name to Tommy Page in the 1960s at the suggestion of a booking agent, who said his name was too closely connected to his stint with Bill Haley and the Comets.\nThough Haley died in 1981, Lytle and other Comets reunited in 1987 and performed off and on until 2009. Lytle, along with other Comets, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year.\nLytle was born on September 1st, 1933, in Old Fort, North Carolina, before his father moved the family to Pennsylvania.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:5acf35fd-d348-4e40-95e9-f7a4a59c354e>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "When Big Joe Turner, a blues shouter who had an R. & B. hit with the song, sings the same line, we see something different.\nHaley died in 1981, at the age of fifty-five, a year or so before John Swenson published his biography, “Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll_._” The Stray Cats were about to become famous by updating much of Haley’s sound. He is little known today compared to Berry, Presley, Little Richard, and the other early kings of rock and roll, for whom he helped cut a path. But “Rock Around the Clock” has remained intermittently iconic. It’s a youthful grandfather to any number of rock party anthems: “Rock and Roll Music,” “Rock and Roll All Nite,” “I Love Rock and Roll.” And when something of the early rebellious rock spirit is sought, it’s Haley’s record that people often reach for. In 1987, LL Cool J tied his hip hop to rock and roll by egging on his d.j.—“Go Cut Creator Go”—instead of that noted guitarist Johnny B. Goode, and by kicking off the track with “One, two, THREE o’clock, four o’clock ROCK!”\n“Rock Around the Clock” climbed to number one in large part because it was the theme music to “Blackboard Jungle,” the 1955 Glenn Ford film that linked rock and roll to a whole range of juvenile delinquencies, from the smashing of jazz albums to attempted rape. During a nineteen-fifties revival, nearly twenty years later, “Rock Around the Clock” was chosen to be the first track on the “American Graffiti” soundtrack, was the theme song for the first two seasons of “Happy Days” and, in 1974, briefly returned to the Billboard Top 40. This nostalgic, early-nineteen-seventies moment presented rock and roll, and Haley’s record in particular, as good, clean fun, a flashback to music now devoid of its former ability to scare as well as to delight.\nThat was nothing new.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:378c2c02-c11f-42ad-8e0a-372821cb988f>::chunk-4"]}, {"passage": "Steve Blues Solo - Napoleons March, 2015\nCheck out Steve’s latest release, By Way of String, and all his other albums.

Yeah! Yeah!: The Story of Pop Music from Bill Haley to Beyoncé,” Bob Stanley didn’t just toss Haley into his subtitle, he went all in. “Haley invented rock ‘n’ roll,” he writes. “No one had blended country & R&B before Haley wrote and recorded ‘Rock the Joint’; no one hit the Billboard Top 20 with something that could be safely labeled rock ‘n’ roll before ‘Crazy Man Crazy’; no one scored a rocking number before ‘Rock around the Clock’ turned the music world upside down.”\nThat “invented” overstates the case, but it serves as a corrective, too, spotlighting the essential-to-the-form contributions of an artist who is usually mentioned only in passing. There are a number of reasons why Haley gets overlooked. He was only a year older than Chuck Berry but seemed more like twenty years older. He looked like a puffy George Reeves, right down to the Superman spit curl, and he favored loud, checked sport jackets, normally associated with vacationing appliance salesmen. (When Jerry Lewis parodied the rock craze in his 1958 film “Rock-a-Bye Baby,” his band was costumed the same way, in mimicry of the Comets.) Onstage, Haley lacked the charisma and energy of other early rockers. He wasn’t a new teen idol but a familiar type: the bandleader. His Comets were a rockin’ band, but one only as good as its material, and after “Shake, Rattle and Roll” (the first rock-and-roll record to go top ten, in 1954) and “Rock Around the Clock,” the quality of their work dropped precipitously. Even Haley’s most thrilling performances were sexless. In “Shake, Rattle and Roll,” when Haley sings “I’m like a one-eyed cat peepin’ in a seafood store,” we imagine a cat, with one eye, looking hungrily into the window of a seafood shop.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:378c2c02-c11f-42ad-8e0a-372821cb988f>::chunk-3"]}], "final_prompt": "You are an accurate and reliable AI assistant that can answer questions with the help of external documents.

His band, Bill Haley & His Comets performed Rock Around the Clock for the movie, Blackboard Jungle in 1955. The movie itself wasn't memorable, but the song was, although it was only heard in the background in opening and closing credits. Part of reason was that the song was \"new.\" It had a faster rhythm compared to the conventional blues, and a rebellious sound. Most importantly it was sung by a White guy.\nRock Around the Clock became very popular. It enjoyed widespread attention and billboard chart success. The song was favorable among White and Black audiences alike - especially White teenagers. This was the definitive start of the mainstream rock n' roll scene.\nAlthough the song was a massive hit, Bill Haley couldn't prolong his success because he was too old. He didn't fulfill the needs of record companies that were looking forward to reach-out to the massive White teenagers who had enough money in hand to buy songs. This opened door for other rock n' roll artists like Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. From 1955 to 1959, rock n' roll was more popular than rhythm & blues and country music.\nRacial tensions were still high in the US in 1950s. Classrooms were segregated; Black kids went to night school. Therefore the arrival of rock n' roll wasn't greatly appreciated by White adults, presumably parents. They saw it as a threat to their way of life since music would somehow integrate both White and Black communities together. As a matter of fact, the title Blackboard Jungle has a slight racial tone to it. Elvis was the most prominent artist at the time as he was the only one signed to a major record label. When he appeared on TV to perform Hound Dog, his legs were cut off from TV due \"inappropriate movements.\" In other words, he was White but danced like a Black guy. As far as the parents concerned, such behavior \"crossed the line.\"\nThere were also Black Rock N' Rollers. Chuck Berry was the best example. He was the Black guy who sang like a White guy. Contrary to Elvis, Berry wrote his own songs. He also played the electric guitar.\n\nDocument 3: Grammy-nominated guitarist, songwriter and arranger Billy Strange, who helped make hits for Elvis Presley, the Beach Boys, and Frank and Nancy Sinatra, has died in Nashville, the Nashville Tennessean reported Wednesday. He was 81.\nThe cause of death was not announced.\n“My dear friend, the legendary guitarist/arranger Billy Strange passed away this morning in Nashville,” Nancy Sinatra wrote on her Twitter page. “My heart is shattered.”\nStrange wrote such hits for Presley as “A Little Less Conversation” and “Memories.” “A Little Less Conversation (Junkie XL Remix),” which he wrote with Scott Davis, was on the soundtrack of both the DreamWorks animated feature films Shark Tale (2004) and Megamind (2010).\n“Limbo Rock,” which he wrote with Kal Mann, was hummed by Nancy Cartwright in the 1995 Simpsons episode Lisa The Vegetarian. It was originally a hit for Chubby Checker.\nA member of the 1960s “Wrecking Crew” of Los Angeles-based session musicians, he was in both the Musicians and Rockabilly Halls of Fame.\nWilliam Everett Strange was born on September 29, 1930; he was born and raised in Long Beach, California. While still a young boy, he performed on local radio with his father and mother. At 14, he started playing guitar; two years later, he was touring with other musicians.\nHe worked in the rodeo, as a truck driver and as a stuntman in his 20s. However, he made music his career, performing early with the likes of Spade Cooley, Roy Rogers, Count Basie, and Speedy West & Jimmy Bryant.\nMajor producers noticed his guitar work. Strange joined The Wrecking Crew, playing on the Beach Boys’ Pet Sounds album. He also was on recordings by The Everly Brothers, Randy Newman, Willie Nelson, Nat King Cole and many others.\nStrange arranged Nancy Sinatra’s megahit “These Boots Are Made for Walkin'”; he directing standup bass player George Burghofer to play the famous descending bridge.

He wrote classic track Only Women Bleed, which has been covered by more than 30 artists since its 1975 release.\nHe’d already been leader of Lou Reed’s band and had worked with Billy Joel before tying up with Cooper. He later worked in the studio with Aerosmith and performed and composed with artists including Peter Gabriel, Nils Lofgren, Rod Stewart, Grand Funk Railroad and many others.\nWagner, who’d rekindled his working relationship with Cooper in recent years, had been ill for some time. He’d undergone heart surgery earlier this month, after fighting back from a severe heart attack in 2007 – and although vowing to “play for you all again one day soon” he was in a medically-induced coma when he passed away last night.\nKiss star Gene Simmons has acknowledged Wagner’s guitar solo on Sweet Pain from the band’s acclaimed Destroyer album and says: “He was the consummate gentleman axeman; he will be missed.”\nSteve Hunter, Wagner’s partner guitarist in Reed’s band during his Berlin period, says: “We played together like none other I’ve ever experienced. It was truly a phenomenon.”\nHis family have posted a statement on his website, saying: “Dick had a huge heart, which is perhaps why it gave him so much trouble – it was simply too full of love, of music and life. His creativity and passion will live on for ever in the legacy he has left for us.\n“He was prolific not only in the tangible realm of what we can see and hear, but in the boundless energy of his spirite. He was a fighter – but in the end his body couldn’t keep up with his spirit, and so he lays to rest.\n“Dick said in 2013: ‘Love is in the air; breathe deep.’ Take his advice into your own hearts, and notice all of the beauty in the world, even when it seems cruel and unfair.”\n\nDocument 9: Marshall Lytle, whose snappy bass work anchored Bill Haley and the Comets' \"Rock Around the Clock,\" died Saturday at his home in New Port Richie, Florida. He was 79. According to The New York Times, Lytle died of lung cancer.\nLytle was a teenage guitar player working at a Chester, Pennsylvania, radio station when Haley, who worked at another station, recruited him to play bass. Lytle notably didn't play the instrument, but Haley taught him the rudiments of slap-bass in a 30-minute session. The technique was key for country music, which was the focus of Haley's band – then known as Bill Haley and His Saddlemen.\n\"He got this old bass fiddle out, started slapping it, with a shuffle beat, and showed me the basic three notes you need on a little bass run to get started with,\" Lytle said in a 2011 radio interview. \"I gave it a try and I said, 'Hell, I can do that.'\"\nHaley's band changed their name to Bill Haley and the Comets in 1952, and Lytle played on memorable tracks including \"Crazy, Man, Crazy\" and \"Shake, Rattle and Roll.\" The bassist developed a lively stage presence, throwing his bass into the air, lifting it over his shoulder and riding it like a horse. The group landed their biggest hit in 1955 after a version of their classic recording of \"Rock Around the Clock\" appeared in the opening credits of the movie Blackboard Jungle.\nLytle and two other band members left Bill Haley and the Comets in 1955 after a salary dispute, branching off into their own group, the Jodimars. The band would become a popular Las Vegas lounge act. Lytle changed his name to Tommy Page in the 1960s at the suggestion of a booking agent, who said his name was too closely connected to his stint with Bill Haley and the Comets.\nThough Haley died in 1981, Lytle and other Comets reunited in 1987 and performed off and on until 2009. Lytle, along with other Comets, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year.\nLytle was born on September 1st, 1933, in Old Fort, North Carolina, before his father moved the family to Pennsylvania.\n\nDocument 10: When Big Joe Turner, a blues shouter who had an R. & B. hit with the song, sings the same line, we see something different.\nHaley died in 1981, at the age of fifty-five, a year or so before John Swenson published his biography, “Bill Haley: The Daddy of Rock and Roll_._” The Stray Cats were about to become famous by updating much of Haley’s sound. He is little known today compared to Berry, Presley, Little Richard, and the other early kings of rock and roll, for whom he helped cut a path. But “Rock Around the Clock” has remained intermittently iconic. It’s a youthful grandfather to any number of rock party anthems: “Rock and Roll Music,” “Rock and Roll All Nite,” “I Love Rock and Roll.” And when something of the early rebellious rock spirit is sought, it’s Haley’s record that people often reach for. In 1987, LL Cool J tied his hip hop to rock and roll by egging on his d.j.—“Go Cut Creator Go”—instead of that noted guitarist Johnny B. Goode, and by kicking off the track with “One, two, THREE o’clock, four o’clock ROCK!”\n“Rock Around the Clock” climbed to number one in large part because it was the theme music to “Blackboard Jungle,” the 1955 Glenn Ford film that linked rock and roll to a whole range of juvenile delinquencies, from the smashing of jazz albums to attempted rape. During a nineteen-fifties revival, nearly twenty years later, “Rock Around the Clock” was chosen to be the first track on the “American Graffiti” soundtrack, was the theme song for the first two seasons of “Happy Days” and, in 1974, briefly returned to the Billboard Top 40. This nostalgic, early-nineteen-seventies moment presented rock and roll, and Haley’s record in particular, as good, clean fun, a flashback to music now devoid of its former ability to scare as well as to delight.\nThat was nothing new.\n\nDocument 11: Steve Blues Solo - Napoleons March, 2015\nCheck out Steve’s latest release, By Way of String, and all his other albums.

Guitarist.\nRochester, NY native Steve Cunningham began playing guitar at age 14, where he was influenced by such diverse artists as Led Zeppelin, Pat Metheny, Yes, and the Brecker Brothers, as well as classical and bluegrass music. Steve relocated to Atlanta where he started playing the lap steel, immersing himself in the styles of David Lindley, western-swing great Tom Morrell, and Sacred Steel player Aubrey Ghent.\nOne of the most in-demand guitarists on the Atlanta scene, Steve performs over 150 dates a year playing jazz, R&B, rock, funk, gospel, country, blues, pop and western-swing among other styles. He has played with Grammy nominated Susan Tedeschi, long-time members of the James Brown band, and Grammy Award winner William Bell, Candi Staton, Fantasia, Colonel Bruce Hampton, as well as opening for Jeff Beck, Kool and the Gang, Dream Theatre, Chuck Mangione, Eddie Money, and Blondie. In addition, he has performed at the The World Series, and headlined at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas along with performing in the movie, “A Joyful Noise”, with Kirk Franklin.\nSteve is a first-call session player, playing on hundreds of local and national album releases, TV and radio commercials, and movie soundtracks. He has recorded for Coca-Cola, Ford, Chevrolet, MLB, NFL, IBM, Cartoon Network, PBS, Microsoft, CNN and NASCAR to name a few, as well as recording with the London Symphony Orchestra.\nAtlanta guitarist, Steve Cunningham, is playing out and about!\nNo upcoming shows scheduled\n\nDocument 12: Posted by themusicsover on January 10, 2010\nJuly 22, 1929 – January 10, 2009\nBilly Brown was an American rockabilly guitarist and singer who launched his career upon his return from the Korean War. Brown released a handful of singles before he was signed by Columbia Records in 1957. A young Jerry Reed played on a few of those early Columbia recordings.

Yeah! Yeah!: The Story of Pop Music from Bill Haley to Beyoncé,” Bob Stanley didn’t just toss Haley into his subtitle, he went all in. “Haley invented rock ‘n’ roll,” he writes. “No one had blended country & R&B before Haley wrote and recorded ‘Rock the Joint’; no one hit the Billboard Top 20 with something that could be safely labeled rock ‘n’ roll before ‘Crazy Man Crazy’; no one scored a rocking number before ‘Rock around the Clock’ turned the music world upside down.”\nThat “invented” overstates the case, but it serves as a corrective, too, spotlighting the essential-to-the-form contributions of an artist who is usually mentioned only in passing. There are a number of reasons why Haley gets overlooked. He was only a year older than Chuck Berry but seemed more like twenty years older. He looked like a puffy George Reeves, right down to the Superman spit curl, and he favored loud, checked sport jackets, normally associated with vacationing appliance salesmen. (When Jerry Lewis parodied the rock craze in his 1958 film “Rock-a-Bye Baby,” his band was costumed the same way, in mimicry of the Comets.) Onstage, Haley lacked the charisma and energy of other early rockers. He wasn’t a new teen idol but a familiar type: the bandleader. His Comets were a rockin’ band, but one only as good as its material, and after “Shake, Rattle and Roll” (the first rock-and-roll record to go top ten, in 1954) and “Rock Around the Clock,” the quality of their work dropped precipitously. Even Haley’s most thrilling performances were sexless. In “Shake, Rattle and Roll,” when Haley sings “I’m like a one-eyed cat peepin’ in a seafood store,” we imagine a cat, with one eye, looking hungrily into the window of a seafood shop.\n\nQuestion: What happened to the guitarist who recorded the guitar solo in 'Rock Around The Clock' with Bill Haley?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Guitarist Danny Cedrone tragically died following a freak accident just 10 days after recording the iconic guitar solo for 'Rock Around The Clock' with Bill Haley and His Comets. Despite his significant contribution to the song, he was only paid $21 for his work on the session. This unfortunate event highlights the risks musicians faced during the era and the often undervalued nature of their contributions."}
{"id": 12, "question": "What are the target timelines for infant hearing screening and intervention in Washington state?", "passages": [{"passage": "Referring Deaf or Hard of Hearing Children to Early Intervention\nEarly Intervention for Children who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing\nDid you know that providers, such as audiologists, otolaryngologists, and pediatricians have a legal obligation to make a referral to the state’s Early Intervention (EI) program as soon as possible, but no later than seven calendar days after the child has been identified with a permanent hearing loss?\nDevelopmental risk and early intervention\nChildren who are born deaf or hard of hearing (D/HH) are at risk for developmental delay because they may lack early exposure to an accessible language. However, data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that some D/HH children were not documented as having received early intervention services. In addition, some D/HH children may be born with other conditions that also can result in developmental delays. Referring D/HH children to early intervention as soon as possible will help ensure that they can reach their full potential. Early Intervention represents the goal of the entire Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) process. To realize the benefits of early identification, intervention services need to be\n- Targeted, and\nIn addition, intervention services for D/HH children need to be implemented promptly and in a family-centered manner. If a family refuses your referral to intervention services, be sure to document the parents’ decision.\nWhat is Early Intervention (EI)?\nEI is a system of services available to children under the age of three who are eligible and may have a developmental or language delay [284KB, 16 pages], disability, or special health condition that is likely to lead to non-typical development. Evaluation and service coordination are provided free of charge.\nIf a child isn’t developing as expected in certain areas, the family may be able to receive early intervention services from the state’s lead agency that works with families and children with different developmental needs. EI services are developmental services that are\n- Selected in collaboration with the parents; and\n- Usually provided at no cost (some Federal or State laws provide for a system of payments by families, including a schedule of sliding fees).", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:de831a53-4931-4481-9a7e-5d6354d6f981>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Permanent childhood hearing loss can be congenital, delayed-onset, progressive, or acquired in nature. Congenital hearing loss refers to hearing loss that is present at birth and is often identified through a newborn hearing screening conducted shortly after birth. While estimates vary, some hearing loss in childhood is delayed-onset or progressive in nature. As a result, it is important to provide audiologic monitoring over time for children who are considered to be \"at risk\" for hearing loss. In addition, some mild hearing losses as well as auditory neuropathy may not be identified through newborn hearing screening due to the current limitations of the test equipment or testing methodology used.\nHearing is critical to speech and language development, communication, literacy, and learning. Early identification and intervention of hearing loss can lessen the impact on a child's development (Sininger, Grimes, & Christensen, 2010; Yoshinaga-Itano, Baca, & Sedey, 2010). The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH, 2007) recommends that\n- all children be screened for hearing loss no later than 1 month of age,\n- hearing and medical evaluations be completed no later than 3 months of age,\n- infants with confirmed hearing loss are fit with amplification (if the family chooses and if appropriate) within 1 month of diagnosis,\n- early intervention services begin no later than 6 months of age.\nNote: The scope of this content is limited to the diagnosis and management of permanent hearing loss for children from birth through 5 years of age from an audiological perspective. Resources for hearing screening and habilitation, as well as hearing loss for school-age and adult populations, are under development.\nFamilies who are actively involved in the assessment and treatment process achieve better outcomes (DesJardin, 2006). It is paramount that audiologists incorporate family-centered practice into the identification and treatment of young children who are deaf or hard of hearing; family-centered activities include\n- engaging the family and using the child's toys from home in various aspects of the evaluation and therapy sessions,\n- suspending judgment and building rapport with the family about their needs and interests,\n- matching re/habilitation with the family needs and goals,\n- recognizing the family's rights regarding informed consent and confidentiality.\nThe goal of family-centered practice is to create a partnership with the family so that the family fully participates in all aspects of the child's care.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:ae5027e9-0b42-4dd3-a40f-01446335461b>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Am Fam Physician. 1999 Sep 1;60(3):1020.\nThe Task Force on Newborn and Infant Hearing of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued a new policy statement recommending development of universal newborn hearing screening programs nationwide. The statement, published in the February 1999 issue of Pediatrics, discusses the justifications for universal hearing screening, tracking and follow-up, identification and intervention, evaluation, and other recommendations and issues. The AAP establishes parameters with the goal of ensuring that all newborns with hearing loss be identified.\n“Significant hearing loss is one of the most common major abnormalities present at birth and, if undetected, will impede speech, language and cognitive development,” according to the policy statement. The average age for detection of significant hearing loss in the United States is less than 14 months, but the AAP would like to see all newborns screened before they leave the hospital so that treatment can be initiated before these infants are six months old. The policy states that about one to three per 1,000 infants in well-baby nurseries have significant loss of hearing in both ears, and about two to four per 100 infants in the intensive care unit have hearing loss.\nThe following five essential elements for an effective screening program were identified by the AAP: initial screening with a test having a high degree of sensitivity and specificity; tracking and follow-up; identification; intervention; and evaluation. Guidelines for each of the five essential elements are discussed in the statement. The following guidelines have been excerpted from the section of the guidelines that discusses identification and intervention in a universal neonatal hearing screening program:\nThe goal of universal screening is that 100 percent of infants with significant congenital hearing loss be identified by three months of age, and appropriate and necessary intervention be initiated by six months of age.\nAppropriate and necessary care for the infant with significant hearing loss should be directed and coordinated by the child's physician within the medical home, with support from appropriate ancillary services.\nA regionalized approach to identification and intervention for infants with significant hearing loss is essential, ensuring access for all children with significant hearing loss to appropriate expert services. The AAP recognizes that professionals with competency in this area may not be available in every community. The child's physician, working with the state department of health, must ensure that every infant with significant hearing loss is referred to the appropriate professionals within the regionalized system.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:e50903c9-447f-4f6e-8371-2773f3114f49>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Hearing screening of newborns is a prerequisite for the early intervention and support needed by hearing impaired children. Early intervention is beneficial for the children's speech, educational, social and emotional development.\nThis has always been the main argument in favour of the universal newborn hearing screening programmes, first implemented in the 1990's and still being introduced around the world. Uruguay is among the countries currently preparing to offer hearing screening of all newborns. The first reports about the long-term effects of these programmes have been issued. They conclude that hearing screening works as advertised.\nVlandern: 85 percent in mainstream schools\nIn the Vlandern region of Belgium, all newborns have been hearing screened since 1998. The vast majority of newborns found to have hearing loss in screenings between 1998 and 2003 made it into mainstream schools, according to a recent evaluation of these children's speech and educational development.\n85 percent of the children five and a half years of age or older and with no other disability than hearing loss go to mainstream schools. Among those, whose hearing loss was treated with a cochlear implant, 79 percent attend mainstream schools.\nThe researchers behind this study concluded that early intervention in hearing impaired children may improve language outcomes and subsequent school and occupational performance.\nUSA: Screening benefits speech development\nIn the United States, hearing screenings became common practice following a recommendation made by the US Preventive Services Task Force in 2001. By 2006, 46 of the 50 states had hearing screening programmes.\nA new report, based on a survey of scientific articles about hearing screening, published since 2002, confirmed that children with hearing loss who had universal newborn hearing screening have better language outcome at school age than those not screened.\nIn particular, the ability to listen and understand speech is supported by early intervention following hearing screening. Children whose hearing loss was identified early, and children who had hearing screenings as newborns were found at 8 years of age to be better at listening and understanding speech than those whose hearing loss was discovered late and children who had not been hearing screened. No difference was found between the two groups in terms of speech ability and language.\nSources: International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology; Pediatrics; www.infanthearing.org", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:d20036aa-5252-4f1e-9778-82cc5cdfdb21>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "early intervention For disadvantaged children\nThe national Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) recommends children with hearing loss receive hearing aids by six months of age.

The Hearing Aid Loaner Bank strives to help these families in need.\nPlace & Year\nProject PartnersFriends of Tennessee’s Babies with Special Needs (FRIENDS)\nIdeally, the process of fitting a child with their first hearing aid should be done quickly after the hearing loss has been diagnosed. In reality, many clinics do not have affordable options for families who find the cost to be a barrier. Furthermore, the process to obtain hearing aids through insurance programs can mean that the child must go without amplification while waiting on approval.\nThe consequence is quite severe; the child might miss the critical period of language development. Research indicates that children identified with hearing loss who begin services before 6 months old develop language – spoken or signed, on par with their hearing peers. Those, who start later, are at a disadvantage.\nLoan hearing aids as long as needed\nThe Friends of Tennessee’s Babies with Special Needs (FRIENDS) addresses this critical problem.

The main focus of early identification and early intervention for a child with hearing loss is on developing communication skills, both verbal and sign language, to the maximum possible extent. Further, if hearing impairment is associated with other disorders like mental retardation, blindness, cerebral palsy, etc., the intervention program addresses those needs also.\nHearing impairment is detrimental to the normal speech and language development in such children. While speech and language are innate skills of human beings, these skills develop only by hearing, listening and incorporating the use of words, intonations, voice variations, and the patterns in which words are strung together to form expressions.\nWhy Early Intervention?\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a hearing screening to be done for every baby a few weeks after birth, and also follow-up visits up to two years of age. With modern technology of manual and automatic hearing testing routines, congenital hearing loss is being identified in children before they are 3 months of age. Identification of hearing impairment is possible by looking into the risk factors, responses of the baby to sounds around and seeking professional help when the risks and signs indicate a hearing problem.\nRisk Factors for Hearing Loss\nSome of the important risk factors associated with hearing loss can be listed and an informal screening can help in determining whether to look out for signs of hearing impairment. The risk factors include:\n• Family history of hearing impairment\n• Prenatal infections in the mother like rubella, herpes simplex and toxoplasmosis\n• Abnormal development of the structures in head and neck region like cleft palate, atresia (absence of pinna), etc\n• Premature birth\n• Medications given in neonatal period\n• Syndrome associated with hearing loss like Waardenburg, neurofibromatosis, etc\n• Recurrent infections in the ear, nose and throat\n• Infections like meningitis, measles, mumps, etc\n• Head trauma\nCertain symptoms may be noticed by the mother or primary caregiver of the baby that can call for a detailed hearing assessment to be done.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:21a75c86-2e6a-4dbb-9bda-9dede43c21f7>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "The Maternal Exit Survey and the Maternal CATI Interview will address the following research questions: (1) What are the factors that impede or enable families to follow-up for early hearing evaluation and intervention; (2) What EHDI strategies implemented by hospitals appear to be most successful in reducing loss to follow-up; and (3) Is loss to follow-up associated with maternal characteristics such as parity, age or ethnicity?

However, data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that some D/HH children were not documented as having received early intervention services. In addition, some D/HH children may be born with other conditions that also can result in developmental delays. Referring D/HH children to early intervention as soon as possible will help ensure that they can reach their full potential. Early Intervention represents the goal of the entire Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) process. To realize the benefits of early identification, intervention services need to be\n- Targeted, and\nIn addition, intervention services for D/HH children need to be implemented promptly and in a family-centered manner. If a family refuses your referral to intervention services, be sure to document the parents’ decision.\nWhat is Early Intervention (EI)?\nEI is a system of services available to children under the age of three who are eligible and may have a developmental or language delay [284KB, 16 pages], disability, or special health condition that is likely to lead to non-typical development. Evaluation and service coordination are provided free of charge.\nIf a child isn’t developing as expected in certain areas, the family may be able to receive early intervention services from the state’s lead agency that works with families and children with different developmental needs. EI services are developmental services that are\n- Selected in collaboration with the parents; and\n- Usually provided at no cost (some Federal or State laws provide for a system of payments by families, including a schedule of sliding fees).\n\nDocument 2: Permanent childhood hearing loss can be congenital, delayed-onset, progressive, or acquired in nature. Congenital hearing loss refers to hearing loss that is present at birth and is often identified through a newborn hearing screening conducted shortly after birth. While estimates vary, some hearing loss in childhood is delayed-onset or progressive in nature. As a result, it is important to provide audiologic monitoring over time for children who are considered to be \"at risk\" for hearing loss. In addition, some mild hearing losses as well as auditory neuropathy may not be identified through newborn hearing screening due to the current limitations of the test equipment or testing methodology used.\nHearing is critical to speech and language development, communication, literacy, and learning. Early identification and intervention of hearing loss can lessen the impact on a child's development (Sininger, Grimes, & Christensen, 2010; Yoshinaga-Itano, Baca, & Sedey, 2010). The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH, 2007) recommends that\n- all children be screened for hearing loss no later than 1 month of age,\n- hearing and medical evaluations be completed no later than 3 months of age,\n- infants with confirmed hearing loss are fit with amplification (if the family chooses and if appropriate) within 1 month of diagnosis,\n- early intervention services begin no later than 6 months of age.\nNote: The scope of this content is limited to the diagnosis and management of permanent hearing loss for children from birth through 5 years of age from an audiological perspective. Resources for hearing screening and habilitation, as well as hearing loss for school-age and adult populations, are under development.\nFamilies who are actively involved in the assessment and treatment process achieve better outcomes (DesJardin, 2006). It is paramount that audiologists incorporate family-centered practice into the identification and treatment of young children who are deaf or hard of hearing; family-centered activities include\n- engaging the family and using the child's toys from home in various aspects of the evaluation and therapy sessions,\n- suspending judgment and building rapport with the family about their needs and interests,\n- matching re/habilitation with the family needs and goals,\n- recognizing the family's rights regarding informed consent and confidentiality.\nThe goal of family-centered practice is to create a partnership with the family so that the family fully participates in all aspects of the child's care.\n\nDocument 3: Am Fam Physician. 1999 Sep 1;60(3):1020.\nThe Task Force on Newborn and Infant Hearing of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has issued a new policy statement recommending development of universal newborn hearing screening programs nationwide. The statement, published in the February 1999 issue of Pediatrics, discusses the justifications for universal hearing screening, tracking and follow-up, identification and intervention, evaluation, and other recommendations and issues. The AAP establishes parameters with the goal of ensuring that all newborns with hearing loss be identified.\n“Significant hearing loss is one of the most common major abnormalities present at birth and, if undetected, will impede speech, language and cognitive development,” according to the policy statement. The average age for detection of significant hearing loss in the United States is less than 14 months, but the AAP would like to see all newborns screened before they leave the hospital so that treatment can be initiated before these infants are six months old. The policy states that about one to three per 1,000 infants in well-baby nurseries have significant loss of hearing in both ears, and about two to four per 100 infants in the intensive care unit have hearing loss.\nThe following five essential elements for an effective screening program were identified by the AAP: initial screening with a test having a high degree of sensitivity and specificity; tracking and follow-up; identification; intervention; and evaluation. Guidelines for each of the five essential elements are discussed in the statement. The following guidelines have been excerpted from the section of the guidelines that discusses identification and intervention in a universal neonatal hearing screening program:\nThe goal of universal screening is that 100 percent of infants with significant congenital hearing loss be identified by three months of age, and appropriate and necessary intervention be initiated by six months of age.\nAppropriate and necessary care for the infant with significant hearing loss should be directed and coordinated by the child's physician within the medical home, with support from appropriate ancillary services.\nA regionalized approach to identification and intervention for infants with significant hearing loss is essential, ensuring access for all children with significant hearing loss to appropriate expert services. The AAP recognizes that professionals with competency in this area may not be available in every community. The child's physician, working with the state department of health, must ensure that every infant with significant hearing loss is referred to the appropriate professionals within the regionalized system.\n\nDocument 4: Hearing screening of newborns is a prerequisite for the early intervention and support needed by hearing impaired children. Early intervention is beneficial for the children's speech, educational, social and emotional development.\nThis has always been the main argument in favour of the universal newborn hearing screening programmes, first implemented in the 1990's and still being introduced around the world. Uruguay is among the countries currently preparing to offer hearing screening of all newborns. The first reports about the long-term effects of these programmes have been issued. They conclude that hearing screening works as advertised.\nVlandern: 85 percent in mainstream schools\nIn the Vlandern region of Belgium, all newborns have been hearing screened since 1998. The vast majority of newborns found to have hearing loss in screenings between 1998 and 2003 made it into mainstream schools, according to a recent evaluation of these children's speech and educational development.\n85 percent of the children five and a half years of age or older and with no other disability than hearing loss go to mainstream schools. Among those, whose hearing loss was treated with a cochlear implant, 79 percent attend mainstream schools.\nThe researchers behind this study concluded that early intervention in hearing impaired children may improve language outcomes and subsequent school and occupational performance.\nUSA: Screening benefits speech development\nIn the United States, hearing screenings became common practice following a recommendation made by the US Preventive Services Task Force in 2001. By 2006, 46 of the 50 states had hearing screening programmes.\nA new report, based on a survey of scientific articles about hearing screening, published since 2002, confirmed that children with hearing loss who had universal newborn hearing screening have better language outcome at school age than those not screened.\nIn particular, the ability to listen and understand speech is supported by early intervention following hearing screening. Children whose hearing loss was identified early, and children who had hearing screenings as newborns were found at 8 years of age to be better at listening and understanding speech than those whose hearing loss was discovered late and children who had not been hearing screened. No difference was found between the two groups in terms of speech ability and language.\nSources: International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology; Pediatrics; www.infanthearing.org\n\nDocument 5: early intervention For disadvantaged children\nThe national Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) recommends children with hearing loss receive hearing aids by six months of age. For children diagnosed later, it is equally imperative that the amplification process is initiated as soon as the hearing loss is confirmed. Unfortunately, not every family can afford hearing aids. The Hearing Aid Loaner Bank strives to help these families in need.\nPlace & Year\nProject PartnersFriends of Tennessee’s Babies with Special Needs (FRIENDS)\nIdeally, the process of fitting a child with their first hearing aid should be done quickly after the hearing loss has been diagnosed. In reality, many clinics do not have affordable options for families who find the cost to be a barrier. Furthermore, the process to obtain hearing aids through insurance programs can mean that the child must go without amplification while waiting on approval.\nThe consequence is quite severe; the child might miss the critical period of language development. Research indicates that children identified with hearing loss who begin services before 6 months old develop language – spoken or signed, on par with their hearing peers. Those, who start later, are at a disadvantage.\nLoan hearing aids as long as needed\nThe Friends of Tennessee’s Babies with Special Needs (FRIENDS) addresses this critical problem. The non-profit organization founded in 1995 provides services to Tennessee children birth to three with hearing loss. The children are recommended by the Tennessee Early Intervention System (TEIS), a federally mandated program providing service coordination. TEIS submits the files of children in financial needwho have been diagnosed and hearing aid fitting has been recommended by an audiologist. With the Hearing Aid Loaner Bank, FRIENDS assists those children in obtaining amplification as soon as possible after being identified until they are approved receive hearing aids through other funding resources. Their team of audiologists tests and fits children enrolled in the early intervention system with hearing aids – all free of charge.\nThe Hear the World Foundation supports FRIENDS by donating new technology to the Hearing Aid Loaner Bank to fit children birth to three with all degrees of hearing loss.\n\nDocument 6: EHDI National Goals\nNational Goals, Program Objectives, and Performance Measures for the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) Tracking and Surveillance System\nGoal 4.

The letter also answers questions such as:\nMay a previous hearing screening (such as a newborn hearing screening outcome or a hearing screening result provided by an Early Head Start program or a health care provider) meet the Part C evaluation requirements?\nHow can Part C programs ensure that a hearing screening or evaluation is completed in a timely manner when a child is determined to be eligible for Part C services based on an established condition?\nIf an initial evaluation has begun and the child requires treatment to resolve any temporary medical conditions before the hearing evaluation can be completed, how should Part C programs ensure that the child remains actively in the eligibility determination process if the hearing evaluation requires more than 45 days to complete?\nThe 4-page Dear Colleague letter is available in PDF, at:\nSOURCE ARTICLE: Center for Parent Information and Resources\nGive us a call at (727) 523-1130 or (800) 825-5736 or request a callback by clicking below.\n\nDocument 9: Early Intervention for Hearing Impairment\nEarly intervention is a term used for the process of identifying conditions in children that may cause delays in development of physical skills, cognitive skills, communication, adaptive skills and social and emotional development. The main focus of early identification and early intervention for a child with hearing loss is on developing communication skills, both verbal and sign language, to the maximum possible extent. Further, if hearing impairment is associated with other disorders like mental retardation, blindness, cerebral palsy, etc., the intervention program addresses those needs also.\nHearing impairment is detrimental to the normal speech and language development in such children. While speech and language are innate skills of human beings, these skills develop only by hearing, listening and incorporating the use of words, intonations, voice variations, and the patterns in which words are strung together to form expressions.\nWhy Early Intervention?\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a hearing screening to be done for every baby a few weeks after birth, and also follow-up visits up to two years of age.

The Tsar was killed by hired assassins on the street in the middle of St. Petersburg. The people who loved him, including many who were wealthy, built a church called The Church on the Spilled Blood in the Tsar’s honor on the spot where he was killed.

For the faithful of Estonia, that their faith and freedom will continue to be a source of strength throughout their country. And for the faithful in St Petersburg and all of Russia, that their faith and numbers will grow and that someday The Church on the Spilled Blood will be a true church again.\nAugust 20, 2018\nThis week school starts for many schools in our part of Montana, and of course for schools all over the country now or in the near future.

But you know what? I really wasn't! I think it's mostly because Russian Orthodox churches (and especially the ones we visited) are so beautiful and ornately decorated on the inside that it's really difficult to get bored of them.\nI visited one more church with a Viking group, and it was definitely one of the best: The Church of Our Savior on Spilled Blood. This church was built on the exact site where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in 1881, and no expense was spared.\nThe outside of the church is extremely eye-catching, and inside the entire thing is covered in mosaics. Restoration of the mosaics is ongoing, but I'm just so glad that this one survived the Bolsheviks and wasn't destroyed.\nI visited St. Petersburg's other famous church on my own during a free afternoon in the city: St. Isaac's Cathedral.\nI actually think this one is one of the least-attractive Russian churches on the outside (with the exception of the massive gold-plated dome)…\n…but it's one of the most beautiful on the inside.\nInside St. Isaac's, the walls and ceiling are covered with mosaic icons, detailed paintings and columns made of malachite and lapis lazuli. I honestly spent nearly an hour inside, just admiring everything (and that was after more than 10 straight days of churches and cathedrals, remember!).\nThe dome is my favorite part, with an image of a white dove in the very center that you could easily miss if you didn't know to look for it.\nSt. Isaac's was closed in the 1930s (along with most churches in Russia), and reopened as a museum, which it remains today. I highly encourage visiting this one on your own (it's not included in any of Viking's tours), and also recommend climbing up to the Colonnade for great views out over St. Petersburg.\nCatherine Palace / Peterhof Palace\nI took a few short trips outside of St.\n\nDocument 2: Choose this essential one-day excursion to St Petersburg with a private guide to obtain the full understanding of its history and character. Start the day with a panoramic ride along the streets and granite embankments of the city in a comfortable car or a minibus. You will have multiple stops to enjoy the fresh air, picture taking and wonderful views.\nOn your way, you will see the main avenue of St Petersburg – the Nevsky Prospect, as well as some nice squares, architectural ensembles, and churches. Then you will cross the Palace Bridge across the Neva River and see the Stock Exchange Square with Rostral Columns.\nThe first excursion of the program is a visit to St Peter and Paul Fortress – the citadel of the city built by the first Russian Emperor Peter the Great. You will touch the history of the Russian tsars in St Peter and Paul Cathedral – the burial place of the Romanov family. Your experienced driver will continue the route driving to the Smolny Cathedral – a recently restored building of sky-blue color, high cupolas and interesting history that our guide will tell you about. Take a break for a traditional Russian lunch in a local restaurant that serves the dishes you always wanted to try.\nAfterwards you will have an inside visit to the Church of our Savior on Spilled Blood, which is a symbol of St Petersburg and a unique representative of Russian style and art. Our next stop will be for the excursion of St Isaac's Cathedral – the biggest cathedral of all Russia in eclectic style. Another functioning church we will visit is St Nicolas or the Naval Cathedral – one of the oldest religious centers of St Petersburg. The last activity of the tour is visiting the Kazan Cathedral – the principal functioning church of the city.\n\nDocument 3: It remained closed and under restoration for over 30 years. It was reopened in August 1997, after 27 years of restoration, but has not been reconsecrated and does not function as a full-time place of worship. The Church of the Saviour on Blood is a Museum of Mosaics. In the pre-Revolution period it was NOT used as a public place of worship.\nExterior: Architecturally, the Cathedral differs from St. Petersburg's other structures. The city's architecture is predominantly Baroque and Neoclassical, but the Savior on Blood harks back to medieval Russian architecture in the spirit of romantic nationalism. It intentionally resembles the 17th-century Yaroslavl churches and the celebrated St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. Interestingly, despite the church’s very obviously Russian aspect, its principle architect, A. Parland, was not even Russian by birth. Both the interior and exterior of the church are decorated with incredibly detailed mosaics, designed and created by the most prominent Russian artists of the day (M.V. Nesterov, V.M. Vasnetsov and M.A. Vrubel). The Church of Our Savior on the Spilled Blood resembles a bit the St. Basil Cathedral on the Red Square in Moscow. The church is a perfect example of how you expect Russia to be: the golden onion domes, and fantastic colors, are so typical of the country, and are absolutely exquisite. What a colorful place to visit ! The views from the Griboyedov Canal are stunning ! I took thousand pictures of this cathedral !!!\nThe Church of Our Savior on the Spilled Blood from the Griboyedov Canal:\nKazan Cathedral from the Griboyedov Canal:\nInterior: Absolutely beautiful - words cannot describe this masterpiece. The interiors walls are covered with what looks like paintings, but upon a closer look are actually tiny mosaics. The walls and ceilings inside the Church are COMPLETELY covered in intricately detailed mosaics and It might be the most beautiful mosaic mural decoration you have ever seen. The mosaic work is AMAZING. Every inch of space seems to be covered with huge religious mosaics, soaring upward to the ornate vaulted ceiling, where the face of Christ looks down in a blaze of light.\n\nDocument 4: Its palaces and parks were created under Empresses Elizabeth and Catherine the Great between 1744 and 1796. The main landmark is the Catherine Palace designed by Rastrelli and the famous Amber Room inside the Palace.\nLunch at a local restaurant.\nOn our way back to St. Petersburg we will stop by an impressive memorial dedicated to the struggle and hardship of the residents living in the city during WWII. The Monument to the Heroic Defenders of Leningrad and St. Petersburg Siege Memorial was built to be the main focal point of Ploshchad Pobedy (Victory Square) in the early 1970s. A special bank account was opened to take donations and many people took part in the construction including volunteers and famous artists of the Soviet Union such as Mikhail Anikushin, Sergey Speransky, and Valentin Kamensky, all of whom participated in the defense of Leningrad.\nOvernight in St. Petersburg (Breakfast, Lunch)\nPETER-&-PAUL FORTRESS - CHURCH OF THE SAVIOR ON SPILLED BLOOD - ST. ISAAC CATHEDRAL\nOur tour of St. Petersburg continues today with three important visits: Peter and Paul Fortress, The Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood and St. Isaac Cathedral.\nPeter-and-Paul Fortress was built in 1704 to defend the city from naval attacks, however it never served its primary purpose. Instead, its historical mission turned out to be rather gruesome: thousands of workers died while building the fortress, many political prisoners, including Peter's own son Alexi were kept and tortured in its cells. The tombs of the Romanov family are also in its Cathedral.\nThe stunning Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood was built on the spot where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in March 1881. The construction of the church was almost entirely funded by the Imperial family and thousands of private donors. Both the interior and exterior of the church are decorated with incredibly detailed mosaics, designed and created by the most prominent Russian artists of the day\nOur next visit is to one of the world’s largest and most splendid St. Isaac Cathedral.\n\nDocument 5: Bronze Horseman\nThe Bronze Horseman is an equestrian statue of Peter the Great, the founder of St Petersburg, and was commissioned in 1768 by Catherine the Great. It is rumored to be the largest stone ever moved by humans, originally weighing 1500 tons and carved down to 1250 tons to be moved to its current site!\nBronze Horseman is located at Senate Square, Saint Petersburg, Russia, 190000\n9. Big Obukhovsky Bridge\nThe Obukhovksy Bridge is St Petersburg’s newest bridge across the Neva River and the only one that isn’t a drawbridge. Opened in December 2004, the bridge is 395 feet tall and 1.75 miles (2,824 meters) long!\nObukhovksy Bridge is located at Saint Petersburg, Russia, 192012\n10. Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood\nFinally, I saved the best for last! The Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood was the place I wanted to see most while I was in St Petersburg. In my opinion, this would be St Petersburg’s equivalent of the Saint Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow, although I did like St Basil’s architecture slightly more!\nHowever, there’s NO denying that this classic Russian architecture is beautiful and unique. I’ve said it a million times, but this kind of architecture was my primary reason for wanting to visit Russia and I was not disappointed!\nAnd, guess what I spy? Onion domes!! Before you think I’ve lost my mind and you’re curious as to what onion domes are, you definitely need to read my Moscow post!\nThe interior of the Church was jaw-dropping. When I first got in, I even forgot to take pictures because I was so amazed!\nBut, I finally remembered I was, in fact, in possession of a camera. Then, I looked around for signs that allowed for photography because, in so many places like this, photography isn’t allowed.\nFinally, once I found proof of permission, I went completely crazy! With the camera that is… (although some days the former could be debated! 😜)\nBuilt between 1883 and 1907, the Church was constructed on the site where Emperor Alexander II was fatally wounded in 1881.\n\nDocument 6: Visit to the cathedrals of St. Petersburg (by car)\n- Saint Petersburg\nThis guided tour by private car or bus will include visits to the three main cathedrals of St. Petersburg: St. Isaac's Cathedral, Church of the Saviour on Spilt Blood and the Holy Trinity Alexander Nevsky Lavra.\nSt. Isaac's Cathedral (the Cathedral of St. Isaac of Dalmatia) is the largest Orthodox church in St. Petersburg and one of the most impressive buildings in St. Petersburg. The gilded dome of St. Isaac is clearly visible from various places in the city. The exterior is decorated with 112 granite columns each of which weighs about 100 tons and more than 400 bas-reliefs, the interior is impressing with elegant marble, malachite and lapis lazuli decor. St Isaac's colonnade located at an altitude of 43 meters offers stunning views of the city.\nChurch of the Resurrection or \"Saviour on the Spilt Blood\" was built on the site of the assassination of the Emperor Alexander II. The cathedral was built in the Russian style accoding to the model of St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. The main decoration of the construction is imosaic decoration that covers the area of over 7,000 sq.m. During the Soviet period the church was used as a warehouse because of \"no cultural value.\" In 1997 the church was renovated and re-opened.\nThe Holy Trinity Alexander Nevsky Lavra (the Alexander Nevsky Monastery) was constructed by the order of Peter the Great at the end of Nevsky Prospekt where he commanded to place the relics of St. Alexander Nevsky (the patron of the new Russian capital). Among the buildings of the Monastery there is a majestic Holy Trinity Cathedral built in the style of early classicism, the Lazarevskoye Cemetery (necropolis of the XVIII century) and the Tikhvin Cemetery (necropolis of Masters of Arts, the burial place of Lomonosov, Suvorov, Karamzin, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Dostoevsky and other prominent figures of Russia).\n\nDocument 7: Isaac's Cathedral and the Bronze Horseman statue, commemorating famed poet Alexander Pushkin's ode to the city founder, to the Church of the Saviour on Spilled Blood, built atop the site where assassins finally succeeded in killing Tsar Alexander II, a tsar who sought change too fast for some, but too slow for others. Change and revolution are common themes to Saint Petersburg. Palace Square may hold a column celebrating Russia's defeat of the French during Napoleon's unsuccessful 19th century invasion, but it was the site of significant scenes of internal revolt, such as Bloody Sunday in 1905, when demonstrators were fired upon by Tsar Nicholas II's guards, and the October Revolution in 1917, when the Bolsheviks came to power, overthrowing the monarchy and moving the capital to Moscow.\nI spent a month in college in Saint Petersburg in the back half of the 1990's, and visited the city again in the early 2000's, and the city has left in indelible mark in my memories. I highly recommend visiting during summer, when the nights are long and visitors can stay up late strolling the Neva and watching the drawbridges over the river open and close. The city is rightly called the \"Venice of the North\", and it is well worth exploring the numerous canals on foot and by boat. A stroll down Nevsky Prospekt shows off exciting architecture like the Admiralty, Kazan Cathedral, and Dom Knigi (The House of Books), while side streets lead to the exquisite Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood (with its nearby Russian craft market) or to the Bank Bridge with its griffins. No visit to Saint Petersburg is complete without a stop at The Hermitage, but I also recommend spending time at the Russian Museum, to see works by Russian artists.\nThis World Heritage Site is all-encompassing enough to include many palaces outside the city. Not to be missed are Peterhof, also known as Petrodvorets, with its grand and gilded cascade of fountains that serves as centerpiece to Peter the Great's homage to Versailles, or Tsarskoye Selo, also known as Pushkin, where Catherine the Great commissioned a grand palace with a famed Amber Room looted by the Germans during World War II.\n\nDocument 8: Inquiry & Booking\nPrice from € 155.00 per person\n2 Day Bus Tour Gems of St. Petersburg\nPeter & Paul Fortress\nChurch on Spilled Blood\nThis 2-Day tour enables you to see the best of this fascinating city with a professional and personable guide. Drive to Peter and Paul Cathedral, the site of most of the tombstones of the Romanovs rulers, explore deep inside the Hermitage museum, visit the Catherine Palace and the gorgeous Fountains of Peterhof and admire the beauty of the Church on Spilled Blood. Feel the pulse of the city while exploring the underground stations and relax on a trip by hydrofoil. An order of the sights may vary.\nDay 1. The gems of St. Petersburg.\nA full day tour includes a general sightseeing tour of the city along with visits to the Hermitage, the world’s famous art treasury, and Peter & Paul Fortress, a place where the city got its start and the Church of our Savior on Spilled Blood, one of the city’s landmarks, as well as several photo stops and shopping.\nThe Hermitage – The Tsar’s former Winter Palace and four other buildings that house one of the world’s premier art collections. Your two hours guided tour visits display rooms with masterpieces by Da Vinci, Rafael, Monet, Rembrandt, and Renoir. Designed by Rastrelli, the Baroque Winter Palace boasts patterned parquet floors, ornate staircases, molded and decorated ceilings.\nPeter and Paul Fortress –Originally built to protect the city from Swedish attack, the fortress soon became Russia’s Tower of London, a place for political prisoners – including Peter the Great’s own son.\nThe Peter and Paul Cathedral –The city’s tallest structure in the days of Peter the Great and even today. Only the television tower exceeds it in height. The ornate interior boasts gilded iconostasis, 18th century paintings, icons, and the tombs of many Tsars and Tsarinas, including Peter the Great and Catherine the Great.\nThe Church on Spilled Blood – It was built on the spot where the Emperor was mortally wounded. The interior of the Church is decorated with incredibly detailed mosaics designed and created by the most prominent Russian artists of the day. The Church was closed for services in 1930 and finally reopened in 1997 after almost 30 years of restoration in all its breathtaking former glory.\n\nDocument 9: Savior on Blood\nThe Cathedral of Our Savior on the Spilt Blood is a unique masterpiece combining the old Russian style of architecture, talent of the best Russian artists and Italian stone carvers, and the art of Roman mosaic. Mosaics cover almost all the surface of the walls and ceilings there are 7 500 square meters of mosaics all in all. It is a unique example of a Russian style cathedral in the centre of St. Petersburg. Its coloured onion domes are so famous, that they are recognized today as one of the symbols of the city. The style of the church was inspired by St Basil's Cathedral on Red Square in Moscow. The onion domes, mosaics and intricately decorated facade are characteristic of 16th to 17th century Russian architecture. Thus, it differs in from most of the buildings of st. Petersburg which follow the western traditions of Neo-Classical and Baroque architecture. The church is one of the top tourists attractions of St. Petersburg, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and a popular spot for taking photographs and acquiring Russian souvenirs. You have an opportunity to see the Spilt Blood Cathedral in all its beauty.\nThis church was built on the very site of Tsar Alexander II murder.\nOfficially consecrated as the Church of the Resurrection of Christ, the Russian Orthodox gem more commonly known as the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood was built to honor tsar Alexander II of Russia, who was assassinated at the site where the church now sits, hence the reference to \"spilled blood\". The section of the street on which the assassination took place is enclosed within the walls of the church and the site of the murder is marked by a chapel in the building. At the request of Alexander III, son of Alexander II, construction on the church began in 1883. Funding for this amazing structure was almost totally provided by the Imperial family with other donations made by private individuals. The project was completed in 1907.\nThe principle architect chosen for the project was Alfred Alexandrovich Parland, who was, incidentally, a non-Russian-born individual. The architecture of the church varies greatly from other buildings and religious structures in St. Petersburg, which were largely constructed in the Baroque and neo-Classical styles.\n\nDocument 10: The domes of the church of the savior on spilled blood The domes However, the era in which Church of the Savior was built was a time of resurgence of nationalism, thus the classic Russian style of the church.\nLooking at both the interior and exterior, it's easy to see why the church cost about 4.6 million rubles, way over the budgeted 3.6 million. The outside was designed to mirror the magnificent St. Basil's in Moscow, the city's easily-recognizable centerpiece, and the building - both inside and outside - features of mosaics, most of them designed by the prominent artists of the time, including Viktor Vasnetsov, Mikhail Nesterov and Mikhail Vrubel. The majority of the mosaics depict biblical scenes and saints though some are just patterns. The colorful onion domes, of which the central one reaches a height of 81 meter (266 ft), are covered with bright enamels. The cathedral boasts a luxurious and rich decor, ornamental architraves, frames, corbels, ceramic tiles, and colored glazed tiles. The belfry is decorated with mosaic coats-of-arms of cities and regions of the Russian empire.\nInteresting fact: This church never functioned as a public place of worship. Today it is a Museum of Mosaics.\nDuring the Russian Revolution of 1917, much of this amazing church was ransacked and the interior was seriously damaged. In the 1930s, the Soviets closed the church, as they did with most churches in St. Petersburg. During World War II, it was used as a storage facility for food. If suffered yet more damage during the war, and afterwards, was used for many years as storage space for a local opera company. In 1970, St. Isaac's Cathedral assumed management of the church, and funds garnered from the cathedral (which was, at that time, a museum) were used to restore the Church of the Savior. Restoration was finally complete in 1997 and remains one of St. Petersburg's top tourist attractions.\nThe Cathedral should not be perceived as simply a cult building; its idea is broader and deeper. The image of the Savior in this Cathedral reflects not so much the cult aspect, but the political, historical, artistic, stylistic importance of the monument, and underscores its importance for the city.\n\nDocument 11: 1882 – Design Competition for Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood, St. Petersburg, Russia\nThis marvelous Russian-style church was built on the spot where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in March 1881 by a group of revolutionaries, who threw a bomb at his royal carriage. The decision was taken to build a church on the spot where the Emperor was mortally wounded, and an architectural competition was held. The church was built between 1883 and 1907 and was officially called the Resurrection of Christ Church. The construction of the church was almost entirely funded by the Imperial family and thousands of private donators. Both the interior and exterior of the church is decorated with incredibly detailed mosaics, designed and created by the most prominent Russian artists of the day (V.M. Vasnetsov, M.V. Nesterov and M.A. Vrubel). Interestingly, despite the church’s very obviously Russian aspect, its principle architect, Alfred Alexandrovich Parland, was not even Russian by birth, nor the winner of the competition. The design harks back to medieval Russian architecture in the spirit of romantic nationalism.\nThe church was closed for services in the 1930s, when the Bolsheviks went on an offensive against religion and destroyed churches all over the country. It remained closed and under restoration for over 30 years and was finally re-opened in 1997 in all its dazzling former glory.\nTranslations of the church’s name vary between guidebooks and include The Church of the Savior on Blood, The Resurrection Church and The Church of the Resurrection of Christ.\n\nDocument 12: It is the largest network of gravity-fed water fountains in the world. We ended our tour of Peterhof with a walk from the prominent center fountain, called the Grand Cascade, along a canal that flowed through the gardens to a pier where a hydrofoil took us back to St. Petersburg.\nWe enjoyed our jaunt across the Gulf of Finland to the mouth of the Neva River. Approaching St. Petersburg by water gave us a new appreciation for the beauty of the buildings on the waterfront. The Hermitage, for instance, was dazzling from a distance! After a nice lunch at the City Café, we hopped back on the bus for a drive by St. Isaac’s Cathedral, the Bronze Horseman statue of Peter the Great, the battleship Aurora, and the Rostral Columns before stopping at the most gorgeous sight in St. Petersburg—The Church on the Spilled Blood!\nThe church was built between 1883 and 1907 on the spot where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in 1881 (hence the gruesome name). Both the exterior, designed in the traditional Russian onion-dome style, and the interior are decorated with bright shades of marble and detailed mosaic tiles. According to restorers, it contains several thousand square yards of mosaics – more than any other church in the world. The church was closed in the 1930s when the atheist Soviets, who were offended by religion, began destroying churches all over the country for being “inappropriate symbols of Christianity”. The church remained closed and under restoration for years and was finally re-opened in 1997, not as a place of worship, but as a Museum of Mosaics. The pictures we took of this church are some of my favorite travel photos!\nIt’s hard to comprehend the damage the city has endured from various disasters including fires, floods and wars, especially the cruel Nazi occupation of WW II, but all the sites we toured have been restored to their original glory. Architecturally, the city ranks as one of the most splendid in Europe. The historic district was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1990. While I didn’t find St. Petersburg to be a particularly congenial city, clearly there is a fondness for art, opulence and beauty here.\n\nDocument 13: The Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood - 3D Jigsaw Puzzle\n|Object||Put together the jigsaw puzzle.|\n|Types||101-499 Pieces, 3D|\n|Dimensions||44 cm x 30 cm x 54 cm / 17.3 in x 11.8 in x 21.3 in|\nPuzzle Pieces: 233\nSize When Completed: 44 cm x 30 cm x 54 cm / 17.3 in x 11.8 in x 21.3 in\nThe Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood is one of the main sights of St. Petersburg, Russia.

This Church was built on the site where Tsar Alexander II was assassinated and was dedicated in his memory.\nCustomer Reviews |Write your own review!\nThis item has yet to be rated\n\nDocument 14: August 27, 2018\nThe following is a short speech I shared with the members of my church on Sunday:\nRecently, I was in Northern Europe, and as always I visited churches and came back with some thoughts I would like to share about people who are in need of our prayers.\nTwo of the places I visited were Tallinn, Estonia, and St. Petersburg, Russia. The people of Estonia gained their independence once in 1918 and again in 1991 at the end of the Soviet Union. They celebrate freedom strongly. Their churches are increasing in attendance, and among those I talked to, their faith is strong. I am reminded of John 8: “You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.”\nThe other place was St. Petersburg, with quite a different situation but one with hope, nevertheless. In 1861 the beloved Tsar Alexander I ended serfdom in Russia. The common people rejoiced at being able to own their own land and end their poverty. The Tsar was killed by hired assassins on the street in the middle of St. Petersburg. The people who loved him, including many who were wealthy, built a church called The Church on the Spilled Blood in the Tsar’s honor on the spot where he was killed. It is one of the most beautiful churches you could ever hope to see, fashioned in multicolored stone and tile both inside and out.\nUnfortunately, since the time of the Soviets, both The Church on the Spilled Blood and St. Isaac’s Cathedral, he largest cathedral in the world, are museums. I was appalled at the idea of a church built by the people to honor a leader of great faith being a museum.\nI ask your prayers for these people. For the faithful of Estonia, that their faith and freedom will continue to be a source of strength throughout their country. And for the faithful in St Petersburg and all of Russia, that their faith and numbers will grow and that someday The Church on the Spilled Blood will be a true church again.\nAugust 20, 2018\nThis week school starts for many schools in our part of Montana, and of course for schools all over the country now or in the near future. Any time that students return to school, our prayers should go with them. As we all know, school includes struggles, both academic and social.\n\nQuestion: Why was the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood built in St. Petersburg?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "The Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood was constructed in St. Petersburg to commemorate Emperor Alexander II, who was tragically assassinated on the site where the church now stands. This act of remembrance was funded predominantly by the Imperial family and numerous private donors. Officially named the Resurrection of Christ Church, it is widely recognized as the Church of the Savior on Spilled Blood."}

Do you want a leg up over your competition in the event of a possible promotion? Have you asked yourself, “Why Should I get PMP Certified?”\nMany project managers with years of experience are finding it increasingly difficult to find a job where they feel their skill set is being adequately used. They find that seemingly less qualified project leaders with half their time investment are being chosen for higher paying jobs and greater benefits. If this sounds familiar, perhaps you could use a PMP® certification.\nHaving a PMP Certification is an excellent way to prove to employers that you are thoroughly experienced and dedicated to your occupation. While this might seem like another unnecessary hurdle to jump through to many long time project managers, it is becoming increasingly important as time goes by. Many large businesses will outright refuse to give a resume without a PMP Certification listing a second glance. If you’re looking to compete for the best position your qualifications can afford you, perhaps a certification can help get you there.\nHow can you best prepare for the certification test? Different people learn through different methods, but many companies cover every part of the exam.\nFor example, Our PMP Training Course offers the following helpful aspects:\n• PMP Certification Exam Prep Study Book\n• Pre-course Quick Reference Guide\n• On-line PMP Exam Simulator\n• Over 600+ Practice PMP Questions\n• 100% PMP Exam Pass Guarantee\n• Critical Exam Taking Techniques\n• Breakfast, Lunch and Snacks Provided\n• In Class Exercises and Accelerated Learning Techniques\n• PMP Eligibility Application Support\n• PMI Approved 36 Contact Hours\n\nDocument 11: Therefore, what are the interrelated tasks that you should perform to be a PMP?\nIf you have the PMP requirements in place that we discussed above, your first step in PMP Certification journey would be to apply for the exam while preparing for the PMP exam in parallel.\n1st Step: Applying for PMP Exam\nYou can login to the PMI website and start filling the application form online as part of the PMP Certification journey. Here, you have to enter your contact information, educational qualifications, and your experience. When you enter your experience, make sure it is as per the five process groups of Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring & Controlling and Closing. In the last section, enter the 35 hours of PMP certification course that you have taken.\nOnce you submit the application online, you will get intimation about fee payment. If your application is picked for audit, you will receive a link to download the audit package. If your application is picked for audit, you can complete the formalities within 90 days of receiving the audit link after which PMI will take about 5-7 days to process the information.\nPMP Exam Fee Payment\nThe next step in the PMP Certification Process if fee payment. You can pay the exam fee of $555 or $405 online through credit card. If you have taken PMI Institute annual membership which is $139, you get to pay $405 otherwise, you pay $555. But, ensure that you get your membership ID before paying the exam fee if you want the discounted fee. Hence, the PMP Certification Process guides you on when to do what.\nSchedule Your Exam\nAfter you get the confirmation of fee payment, your next step in the PMP Certification Process is to schedule your exam. But, this generally depends on the preparation that you have done so far in terms of study. Normally, schedule the exam date based on the score you get in your practice tests.\nBut, if you are the type driven by the date, do a reverse scheduling in the PMP Certification Process. Meaning, fix the date and accordingly prepare for the exam.\nPMP Certification process helps you understand the checkpoints to focus on. One such point is to check if you are within one year from the time you get your eligibility ID before scheduling the exam.\n\nDocument 12: Test prep.

{"id": 15, "question": "What is referential transparency in functional programming and what are its main benefits?", "passages": [{"passage": "In particular, a function can not set state. This is a very different way of thinking from imperative languages such as Java, where there are objects all over the place with state that gets changed by method calls.\nReferential transparency is a phrase from the functional programming world which means, basically, \"no side effects\". Side effects include reading any state which is not passed in as an argument or setting any state which is not part of what is passed back as an argument. If a function is referentially transparent, then a call to that function with a specific set of values as arguments will always return exactly the same value.\nWhen functions are composed into larger functions, it is easier to reason about them when they are referentially transparent and there are no side effects to worry about. Of course, in the real world it can be very useful to be able to store some state data, so how does one implement this functionality in a pure functional language?\nThe answer is Monads. This is described pretty well in a 1992 paper by Philip Wadler called \"Monads for functional programming\". Reading this paper helped me understand the motivation for monads. Monads provide a way to collect all those side effects into known locations in the program. When all of the side effects are collected into monads, the rest of the program (all of the non-monad parts) are still referentially transparent, so remain easier to compose. The side effects are still there, but because they are encapsulated by the monads, it is easier to deal with them.\nGroup TheoryWhen you read about monads, at some point you will come across a mention of Category Theory as the source of monads. Category Theory is pretty abstract, and you don't need to know it to understand monads. But monads are a mathematical concept, so digging into the math background of the concept could help solidify your understanding.\nAfter reading a bunch of stuff about Category Theory, I went back to Group Theory, which for our purposes you can think of as a special case of Category Theory. While reviewing groups, rings and fields, I stumbled across monoids, a term which I had not recalled from my readings in the field years ago. It's not quite the same thing as a monad, but because Group Theory is focused on transformations, I started thinking of monads as transformations, which I think helped my understanding of them.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:aa827bbd-db41-44ae-b756-cb2eb438e1ee>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "Definitions for functional programming\nThis page provides all possible meanings and translations of the word functional programming\nProgramming in a style that, in lieu of assignment, uses procedure calls to bind variables to values.\nIn computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative programming style, which emphasizes changes in state. Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate computability, the Entscheidungsproblem, function definition, function application, and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus. In practice, the difference between a mathematical function and the notion of a function used in imperative programming is that imperative functions can have side effects that may change the value of program state. Because of this, they lack referential transparency, i.e. the same language expression can result in different values at different times depending on the state of the executing program. Conversely, in functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) both times. Eliminating side effects can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.\nThe numerical value of functional programming in Chaldean Numerology is: 2\nThe numerical value of functional programming in Pythagorean Numerology is: 3\nImages & Illustrations of functional programming\nFind a translation for the functional programming definition in other languages:\nSelect another language:\nDiscuss these functional programming definitions with the community:\nWord of the Day\nWould you like us to send you a FREE new word definition delivered to your inbox daily?\nUse the citation below to add this definition to your bibliography:\n\"functional programming.\" Definitions.net.

The concept of Referential Transparency will come naturally in F#, and it is a driver in how systems are built and pieces of that system are composed. Execution characteristics of a system become more predictable, because values cannot change when you didn’t anticipate them to change.\nFurthermore, when values are immutable, concurrent programming becomes simpler. Because values cannot be changed due to immutability, some of the more difficult concurrency problems you can encounter in C# are not a concern in F#. Although the use of F# does not magically solve all concurrency problems, it can make things easier.\nExpressions instead of statements\nAs mentioned earlier, F# makes use of expressions. This is in contrast with C#, which uses statements for nearly everything. The difference between the two can initially seem subtle, but there is one thing to always keep in mind: an expression produces a value. Statements do not.\nIn the previous code sample, you can see a few things which are very different from imperative languages like C#:\nif...then...elseis an expression, not a statement.\n- Each branch of the\nifexpression produces a value, which in this case is the return value of the\n- Each invocation of\ngetMessageis an expression which takes a string and produces a string.\nAlthough this is very different from C#, you’ll most likely find that it feels natural when writing code in F#.\nDiving a bit deeper, F# actually uses expressions to model statements. These return the\nunit is roughly analogous to\nvoid in C#:\nIn the previous sample\nfor expression, everything is of type\nunit. Unit expressions are expressions which return no value.\nF# arrays, lists, and sequences\nThe previous code samples have used F# arrays and lists. This section explains them a bit more.\nF# comes with a few collection types, and the most commonly used ones are arrays, lists, and sequences.\n- F# arrays are .NET arrays. They are mutable, which means that their values can be changed in-place. They are evaluated eagerly.\n- F# lists are immutable singly-linked lists. They can be used to form list patterns with F# pattern matching. They are evaluated eagerly.\n- F# sequences are immutable\nIEnumerable<T>s under the covers. They are evaluated lazily.\nF# arrays, lists, and sequences also have array, list, and sequence expression syntax.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:8ba8e419-8a2a-45a0-b225-59f829bf8ecb>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "The definition of functional programming is quite easy. Functional programming is the programming with mathematical functions. Is that all? Of course, not!\nFunctional programming is the programming with mathematical functions. I think, you already guess it. The key to this definition is the expression mathematical function. Mathematical functions are functions that return every time the same result when given the same arguments. They behave like an infinite big lookup table.\nThe property, that a function (expression) always returns the same result when given the same arguments, is called referential transparency. Referential transparency has far reaching consequences:\n- Mathematical functions can not have a side effect and can therefore not change the state outside the function body.\n- The function call can be replaced with its result, but can also be reordered or put on a different thread.\n- The program flow is defined by the data dependencies and not by the sequence of instructions.\n- Mathematical functions are a lot easier to refactor and to test because you can reason about the function in isolation.\nThat sounds very promising. But which so many advantages, there is a massive restriction. Mathematical functions can not talk to the outside world. Examples?\nMathematical functions can't\n- get user input or read from files.\n- write to the console of into a file.\n- return random numbers or time, because the return values are different.\n- build a state.\nThanks to mathematical functions, the definition of functional is very concise but helps not so much. The key question still remains. How can you program something useful with functional programming? Mathematical functions are like islands that have no communication with the outside world. Or to say it in the words of Simon Peyton Jones, one of the fathers of Haskell. The only effect that mathematical functions can have is to warm up your room.\nNow I will be a little bit more elaborated. What are the characteristics of functional programming languages?\nCharacteristics of functional programming languages\nHaskell will help me a lot on my tour through the characteristics of functional programming.\nThere are two reasons for using Haskell.\n- Haskell is a pure functional programming language and therefore you can study very well the characteristics of functional programming by using Haskell.\n- Haskell may be the most influential programming language of the last 10 - 15 years.\nMy second statement needs a proof.

Even handy techniques such as currying tend to get overly complex if you want to handle all the possible downstream dataflow paths in a structured way.\nI (think I) know that monads are supposed to be a highly general way of addressing this problem, but it seems 99% of programmers (including me) have a really really hard time properly understanding the concept well enough that it would help make their code clearer, to them and others.\nThis is where I find the principles around network composability of Flow-based programming (FBP) shines so brightly.\nIt solves the composability problem in three basic ways:\n- It gives each input and output its own identity, in the form of ports.\n- It allows to define the data dependencies between these ports, instead of between functions.\n- It allows the setup of these dependencies to happen at any place in the program, which makes it easy to e.g. produce a list of all the connections, as e.g. a simple list of (outport, inport) tuples.\nThe second point above is significant, as it means data dependencies are defined at the level of data, not functions.\nTrying to define data dependencies by defining dependencies between functions, is a major impedance mismatch in my books, and what is causing the need for such complicated syntax in a lot of functional programming.\nFlow-based programs on the other hand, are so easy that they can be simplified to two main parts:\n- A list of processes (Somewhat the counterpart to functions in FP)\n- A list of connections between input- and output ports.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:a64cc173-4778-47fc-94d3-9283ec599230>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Hi everyone, recently I started exploring Cats library in Scala and so here I’m presenting you the first session on “Introduction to Cats”.

It is an effective way of breaking complex problems into smaller parts and solving each piece at a time. In the world of software engineering, Java, one of the most popular programming languages worldwide, has adopted this form of programming as an effective and comprehensive way to understand the language and its capabilities.\nWhat is Functional Programming?\nFunctional programming is a style of programming that focuses on breaking down a larger problem into smaller parts. It is based on mathematics, specifically the concept of lambda calculus, which is the theoretical basis of functional programming. The main idea behind functional programming is that code can be written succinctly and concisely, allowing programmers to focus more on logic and less on control flow. This makes it easier to write code with fewer bugs and fewer lines of code. Additionally, because of the way data is manipulated, functional programming can be more efficient for certain types of problems.\nFunctional programming also encourages the use of immutable data structures, which are data structures that cannot be changed once they are created. This helps to ensure that data is not accidentally modified, which can lead to unexpected results. Additionally, immutable data structures can be used to create more efficient algorithms, as they can be reused without having to be recreated each time.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Java Functional Programming\nLike any programming language, there are a few key advantages and disadvantages of functional programming in Java. One of the main advantages is that functional programming can help programmers write more concise code, while at the same time improving readability. Additionally, it helps reduce coding bugs, as well as avoids dealing with complex control flow. On the downside, it can take some getting used to because of its small syntax and complex functions. Additionally, some may find it difficult to debug, since errors may not be easy to detect.\nAnother disadvantage of functional programming in Java is that it can be difficult to maintain. This is because the code is often written in a way that is difficult to modify or update. Additionally, it can be difficult to integrate with existing code, as it may require a complete rewrite. Finally, functional programming can be difficult to learn, as it requires a deep understanding of the language and its concepts.\nUnderstanding the Basics of Java Functional Programming\nFunctional programming in Java doesn’t require a lot of extra knowledge to start getting into it; however, understanding some of the concepts behind it will be helpful in grasping the language.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:72a7b6e3-4b16-4eaa-8207-07429183355c>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "In this paper we present a model of distribution as a natural consequence of deterministic concurrency; a purely declarative form of concurrency that preserves referential transparency.

This article presents some of the most important aspects of functional programming in general and provides several examples in Python.\nFunctional programming is a kind of the declarative programming paradigm where functions represent relations among objects, like in mathematics. Thus, functions are much more than ordinary routines.\nIn this article, you’ll find explanations on several important principles and concepts related to functional programming:\n- pure functions,\n- anonymous functions,\n- recursive functions,\n- first-class functions,\n- immutable data types.\nA pure function is a function that:\n- is idempotent — returns the same result if provided the same arguments,\n- has no side effects.\nIf a function uses an object from a higher scope or random numbers, communicates with files and so on, it might be impure because its result doesn’t depend only on its arguments.\nA function that modifies objects outside of its scope, write to files, prints to the console and so on, have side effects and might be impure as well.\nPure functions usually don’t use objects from outer scopes and thus avoid shared states. This might simplify a program and help escape some errors.\nAnonymous (lambda) functions can be very convenient for functional programming constructs. They don’t have names and usually are created ad-hoc, with a single purpose.\nIn Python, you create an anonymous function with the lambda keyword:\nlambda x, y: x + y\nThe above statement creates the function that accepts two arguments and returns their sum. In the next example, the functions f and g do the same thing:\n>>> f = lambda x, y: x + y >>> def g(x, y): return x + y\nA recursive function is a function that calls itself during the execution. For example, we can use recursion to find the factorial in the functional style:\n>>> def factorial_r(n): if n == 0: return 1 return n * factorial_r(n - 1)\nAlternatively, we can solve the same problem with the while or for loop:\n>>> def factorial_l(n): if n == 0: return 1 product = 1 for i in range(1, n+1): product *= i return product\nFirst Class Functions\nIn functional programming, functions are the first-class objects, also called higher-order functions — the data types treated the same way as other types.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:3fe9ce03-59d4-4d67-9a7d-7512262bb6a1>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "[Haskell-cafe] \"show\" for functional types\nhaskell at sleepingsquirrel.org\nFri Mar 31 23:10:56 EST 2006\nBrian Hulley wrote:\n] Here is another example.

This is a very different way of thinking from imperative languages such as Java, where there are objects all over the place with state that gets changed by method calls.\nReferential transparency is a phrase from the functional programming world which means, basically, \"no side effects\". Side effects include reading any state which is not passed in as an argument or setting any state which is not part of what is passed back as an argument. If a function is referentially transparent, then a call to that function with a specific set of values as arguments will always return exactly the same value.\nWhen functions are composed into larger functions, it is easier to reason about them when they are referentially transparent and there are no side effects to worry about. Of course, in the real world it can be very useful to be able to store some state data, so how does one implement this functionality in a pure functional language?\nThe answer is Monads. This is described pretty well in a 1992 paper by Philip Wadler called \"Monads for functional programming\". Reading this paper helped me understand the motivation for monads. Monads provide a way to collect all those side effects into known locations in the program. When all of the side effects are collected into monads, the rest of the program (all of the non-monad parts) are still referentially transparent, so remain easier to compose. The side effects are still there, but because they are encapsulated by the monads, it is easier to deal with them.\nGroup TheoryWhen you read about monads, at some point you will come across a mention of Category Theory as the source of monads. Category Theory is pretty abstract, and you don't need to know it to understand monads. But monads are a mathematical concept, so digging into the math background of the concept could help solidify your understanding.\nAfter reading a bunch of stuff about Category Theory, I went back to Group Theory, which for our purposes you can think of as a special case of Category Theory. While reviewing groups, rings and fields, I stumbled across monoids, a term which I had not recalled from my readings in the field years ago. It's not quite the same thing as a monad, but because Group Theory is focused on transformations, I started thinking of monads as transformations, which I think helped my understanding of them.\n\nDocument 2: Definitions for functional programming\nThis page provides all possible meanings and translations of the word functional programming\nProgramming in a style that, in lieu of assignment, uses procedure calls to bind variables to values.\nIn computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids state and mutable data. It emphasizes the application of functions, in contrast to the imperative programming style, which emphasizes changes in state. Functional programming has its roots in lambda calculus, a formal system developed in the 1930s to investigate computability, the Entscheidungsproblem, function definition, function application, and recursion. Many functional programming languages can be viewed as elaborations on the lambda calculus. In practice, the difference between a mathematical function and the notion of a function used in imperative programming is that imperative functions can have side effects that may change the value of program state. Because of this, they lack referential transparency, i.e. the same language expression can result in different values at different times depending on the state of the executing program. Conversely, in functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) both times. Eliminating side effects can make it much easier to understand and predict the behavior of a program, which is one of the key motivations for the development of functional programming.\nThe numerical value of functional programming in Chaldean Numerology is: 2\nThe numerical value of functional programming in Pythagorean Numerology is: 3\nImages & Illustrations of functional programming\nFind a translation for the functional programming definition in other languages:\nSelect another language:\nDiscuss these functional programming definitions with the community:\nWord of the Day\nWould you like us to send you a FREE new word definition delivered to your inbox daily?\nUse the citation below to add this definition to your bibliography:\n\"functional programming.\" Definitions.net.

Functional languages are one kind of declarative language\n. They are mostly based on the typed lambda-calculus\nwith constants. There are no side-effects\nto expression evaluation so an expression, e.g. a function applied to certain arguments, will always evaluate to the same value (if its evaluation terminates). Furthermore, an expression can always be replaced by its value without changing the overall result (referential transparency\nThe order of evaluation of subexpressions is determined by the language's evaluation strategy\n. In a strict\n) language this will specify that arguments are evaluated before applying a function whereas in a non-strict (call-by-name\n) language arguments are passed unevaluated.\nPrograms written in a functional language are generally compact and elegant, but have tended, until recently, to run slowly and require a lot of memory.\nExamples of purely functional languages are Clean\n, and SML\n. Many other languages such as Lisp\nhave a subset which is purely functional but also contain non-functional constructs.\nSee also lazy evaluation\nLecture notes (ftp://ftp.cs.olemiss.edu/pub/tech-reports/umcis-1995-01.ps). or the same in dvi-format (ftp://ftp.cs.olemiss.edu/pub/tech-reports/umcis-1995-01.dvi).\nSEL-HPC Article Archive (http://lpac.ac.uk/SEL-HPC/Articles/).\n\nDocument 4: Immutability does more than just change the way you manipulate data in lists. The concept of Referential Transparency will come naturally in F#, and it is a driver in how systems are built and pieces of that system are composed. Execution characteristics of a system become more predictable, because values cannot change when you didn’t anticipate them to change.\nFurthermore, when values are immutable, concurrent programming becomes simpler. Because values cannot be changed due to immutability, some of the more difficult concurrency problems you can encounter in C# are not a concern in F#. Although the use of F# does not magically solve all concurrency problems, it can make things easier.\nExpressions instead of statements\nAs mentioned earlier, F# makes use of expressions. This is in contrast with C#, which uses statements for nearly everything. The difference between the two can initially seem subtle, but there is one thing to always keep in mind: an expression produces a value. Statements do not.\nIn the previous code sample, you can see a few things which are very different from imperative languages like C#:\nif...then...elseis an expression, not a statement.\n- Each branch of the\nifexpression produces a value, which in this case is the return value of the\n- Each invocation of\ngetMessageis an expression which takes a string and produces a string.\nAlthough this is very different from C#, you’ll most likely find that it feels natural when writing code in F#.\nDiving a bit deeper, F# actually uses expressions to model statements. These return the\nunit is roughly analogous to\nvoid in C#:\nIn the previous sample\nfor expression, everything is of type\nunit. Unit expressions are expressions which return no value.\nF# arrays, lists, and sequences\nThe previous code samples have used F# arrays and lists. This section explains them a bit more.\nF# comes with a few collection types, and the most commonly used ones are arrays, lists, and sequences.\n- F# arrays are .NET arrays. They are mutable, which means that their values can be changed in-place. They are evaluated eagerly.\n- F# lists are immutable singly-linked lists. They can be used to form list patterns with F# pattern matching. They are evaluated eagerly.\n- F# sequences are immutable\nIEnumerable<T>s under the covers. They are evaluated lazily.\nF# arrays, lists, and sequences also have array, list, and sequence expression syntax.\n\nDocument 5: The definition of functional programming is quite easy. Functional programming is the programming with mathematical functions. Is that all? Of course, not!\nFunctional programming is the programming with mathematical functions. I think, you already guess it. The key to this definition is the expression mathematical function. Mathematical functions are functions that return every time the same result when given the same arguments. They behave like an infinite big lookup table.\nThe property, that a function (expression) always returns the same result when given the same arguments, is called referential transparency. Referential transparency has far reaching consequences:\n- Mathematical functions can not have a side effect and can therefore not change the state outside the function body.\n- The function call can be replaced with its result, but can also be reordered or put on a different thread.\n- The program flow is defined by the data dependencies and not by the sequence of instructions.\n- Mathematical functions are a lot easier to refactor and to test because you can reason about the function in isolation.\nThat sounds very promising. But which so many advantages, there is a massive restriction. Mathematical functions can not talk to the outside world. Examples?\nMathematical functions can't\n- get user input or read from files.\n- write to the console of into a file.\n- return random numbers or time, because the return values are different.\n- build a state.\nThanks to mathematical functions, the definition of functional is very concise but helps not so much. The key question still remains. How can you program something useful with functional programming? Mathematical functions are like islands that have no communication with the outside world. Or to say it in the words of Simon Peyton Jones, one of the fathers of Haskell. The only effect that mathematical functions can have is to warm up your room.\nNow I will be a little bit more elaborated. What are the characteristics of functional programming languages?\nCharacteristics of functional programming languages\nHaskell will help me a lot on my tour through the characteristics of functional programming.\nThere are two reasons for using Haskell.\n- Haskell is a pure functional programming language and therefore you can study very well the characteristics of functional programming by using Haskell.\n- Haskell may be the most influential programming language of the last 10 - 15 years.\nMy second statement needs a proof. I will provide them in the next post for Python and in particular C++. Therefore, a few words about Java, Scala, and C#.\n\nDocument 6: This is fine as long as you have only one process doing the changing. To protect against the simultaneous\nmodiﬁcation of shared memory,\nwe use locking. But locking doesn’t scale! In message passing concurrency, there is no shared state.\nAll computations are done in processes, and they only exchange data through asynchronous message passing. But locking doesn’t scale! The Erlang view of the world is that everything is a process that lacks shared memory and influences another only by exchanging asynchronous messages. This style of programming is called... Large number of processes.\nComplete isolation of processes.\nNo shared memory.\nPure messaging: no pointers; you copy data you pass.\nAvoid sequential bottlenecks.\nLocation transparency. Concurrency Oriented Programming Fault\ntolerance To make a fault-tolerant system, you need at least 2 isolated computers. You are now doing concurrent, distributed programming! To do very fault-tolerant computing, you need lots of computers. We've also made the system\nmore scalable! Scalability comes from having lots of isolated things -- which also makes it more fault tolerant.\nFault tolerance, distribution, concurrency, scalability are indispensable and intertwined! Sharing is what stands in the way of fault tolerance and scalability! Erlang espouses all the concepts we’ve discusses so far: • No shared memory\n• “Pure” message passing\n• High concurrency\n• Robust fault tolerance\n• Hot swappability of code\nErlang wasn’t developed with multi-cores in mind, but it just happens to run on multi-cores very nicely thanks to the above properties.

Erlang’s\nnature Erlang is a functional language.\nIn functional programming, you avoid state and mutable data. Functions are first-class citizens:\nyou can assign them as variables, you can pass them around, you can return them from other functions. Side effects are strictly controlled:\nif you call the same function twice with the same arguments, it should return the same value. Referential transparency:\nstate has to be carried in and out.\n\nDocument 7: What is Functional Programming?\nFirstly, Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which everything is bound using pure mathematical functions. It’s a declarative programming approach. In contrast to an imperative style, which focuses on “how to solve,” it focuses on “what to solve.” Instead of statements, it uses expressions. A statement is executed to assign variables, but an expression is evaluated to create a value. In addition, Those functions have some unique characteristics.\nComponents of functional programming\n- Pure functions\n- Referential transparency\n- Functions are First-Class and can be Higher-Order\nWhat is a Pure Function?\nPure functions are normal functions with some characteristics :\n- Total / Not Partial\n- No Randomness\n- No Side Effects\n- Not Null\n- No Exception\n- No Mutation\nExample of Pure Function\ndef add(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b\nExample of Not a Pure Function\ndef divide(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a / b\nThe ‘divide’ function passes all the parameters of being a pure function but if in case ‘a’ will be divided by 0, Then it will throw an exception which will make it not a pure function.\nAdvantages and disadvantages of Functional Programming\n- This programming aids in the effective resolution of difficulties.\n- It improves modularity.\n- It allows us to implement lambda calculus in order to solve complex problems\n- Some programming languages support nested functions so it improves the maintainability of the code\n- It reduces complex problems into simple pieces so that it will be easy to solve.\n- It’s difficult to grasp for novices, hence it’s not a beginner-friendly paradigm approach for new programmers.\n- Maintenance is difficult during the coding phase when the project size is large\n- Moreover, Reusability in Functional programming is a tricky task for developers\nFor further information on functional programming wait for the next blog…\nFor more details please visit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\n\nDocument 8: Those tenets will be the subject of my email course:\n- Functions are pure\n- Functions use immutable data\n- Functions guarantee referential transparency\n- Functions are first-class entities\nAfter that, I’ll briefly touch on how functional programming applies these tenets to encourage us to think carefully about our data and the functions that interact with it.\nBy the end, you’ll be able to understand how this approach leads to code that is:\n- Easier to understand (that is, “expressive”)\n- Easier to reuse\n- Easier to test\n- Easier to maintain\n- Easier to refactor\n- Easier to optimize\n- Easier to reason about\nSound exciting?

Even handy techniques such as currying tend to get overly complex if you want to handle all the possible downstream dataflow paths in a structured way.\nI (think I) know that monads are supposed to be a highly general way of addressing this problem, but it seems 99% of programmers (including me) have a really really hard time properly understanding the concept well enough that it would help make their code clearer, to them and others.\nThis is where I find the principles around network composability of Flow-based programming (FBP) shines so brightly.\nIt solves the composability problem in three basic ways:\n- It gives each input and output its own identity, in the form of ports.\n- It allows to define the data dependencies between these ports, instead of between functions.\n- It allows the setup of these dependencies to happen at any place in the program, which makes it easy to e.g. produce a list of all the connections, as e.g. a simple list of (outport, inport) tuples.\nThe second point above is significant, as it means data dependencies are defined at the level of data, not functions.\nTrying to define data dependencies by defining dependencies between functions, is a major impedance mismatch in my books, and what is causing the need for such complicated syntax in a lot of functional programming.\nFlow-based programs on the other hand, are so easy that they can be simplified to two main parts:\n- A list of processes (Somewhat the counterpart to functions in FP)\n- A list of connections between input- and output ports.\n\nDocument 10: Hi everyone, recently I started exploring Cats library in Scala and so here I’m presenting you the first session on “Introduction to Cats”. It will give you a head start in Cats. Let me give you a brief description as well.\nWhat is Functional Programming?\nFunctional programming (FP) is a style of software development emphasizing functions that don’t depend on program state. Functional code is easier to test and reuse, simpler to parallelize, and less prone to bugs than other code. In simple words, in functional programming we use pure functions only i.e they have no side-effects.\nBy no side-effect I mean that the function will only return a result and won’t do the following:\n- Modifying a variable\n- Modifying a data structure in place\n- Setting a field on an object\n- Throwing an exception or halting with an error\n- Printing to the console or reading user input\n- Reading from or writing to a file\nWhat is Cats?\nCats is a library which provides an abstraction for functional programming in Scala. Its focus is on providing functional abstractions that are modular, approachable and efficient. A broader goal of Cats is to provide a foundation for an ecosystem of pure, typeful libraries to support functional programming in Scala applications.\nHere are slides for you:\nHere is the session recording for you:\nI hope the session will be helpful to you and you will get a kickstart in Cats. There will be more sessions soon. So, stay tuned!\n\nDocument 11: Functional programming is a type of programming in which the output is determined by the inputs. It is an effective way of breaking complex problems into smaller parts and solving each piece at a time. In the world of software engineering, Java, one of the most popular programming languages worldwide, has adopted this form of programming as an effective and comprehensive way to understand the language and its capabilities.\nWhat is Functional Programming?\nFunctional programming is a style of programming that focuses on breaking down a larger problem into smaller parts. It is based on mathematics, specifically the concept of lambda calculus, which is the theoretical basis of functional programming. The main idea behind functional programming is that code can be written succinctly and concisely, allowing programmers to focus more on logic and less on control flow. This makes it easier to write code with fewer bugs and fewer lines of code. Additionally, because of the way data is manipulated, functional programming can be more efficient for certain types of problems.\nFunctional programming also encourages the use of immutable data structures, which are data structures that cannot be changed once they are created. This helps to ensure that data is not accidentally modified, which can lead to unexpected results. Additionally, immutable data structures can be used to create more efficient algorithms, as they can be reused without having to be recreated each time.\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Java Functional Programming\nLike any programming language, there are a few key advantages and disadvantages of functional programming in Java. One of the main advantages is that functional programming can help programmers write more concise code, while at the same time improving readability. Additionally, it helps reduce coding bugs, as well as avoids dealing with complex control flow. On the downside, it can take some getting used to because of its small syntax and complex functions. Additionally, some may find it difficult to debug, since errors may not be easy to detect.\nAnother disadvantage of functional programming in Java is that it can be difficult to maintain. This is because the code is often written in a way that is difficult to modify or update. Additionally, it can be difficult to integrate with existing code, as it may require a complete rewrite. Finally, functional programming can be difficult to learn, as it requires a deep understanding of the language and its concepts.\nUnderstanding the Basics of Java Functional Programming\nFunctional programming in Java doesn’t require a lot of extra knowledge to start getting into it; however, understanding some of the concepts behind it will be helpful in grasping the language.\n\nDocument 12: In this paper we present a model of distribution as a natural consequence of deterministic concurrency; a purely declarative form of concurrency that preserves referential transparency. This extends the demand driven model used as the operational basis of functional languages, into one with multiple independent demands without the need to allow non-determinism to appear at the user level. The abstract model of this distributed system uses a uniform access memory model in order to provide a global memory view. This, combined with explicit thread based concurrency and explicit representation of demand enables the trustable distribution of reactive systems across different systems. Since referential transparency is preserved, any pattern of distribution has no effect on the semantics of the functional program. Computation, including both code and data, can be moved in response to demand.

This means that a function call can be replaced with its result without changing the program's behavior. It is a key concept that ensures predictability and ease of reasoning about code.\n\nThe main benefits of referential transparency include:\n1. Predictability: Since functions always produce the same output for the same input, the behavior of a program becomes more predictable and easier to understand.\n2. Easier Debugging: With referential transparency, debugging becomes simpler because the output of a function depends solely on its inputs, making it easier to isolate and identify issues.\n3. Composability: Functions can be composed more easily, as they do not have hidden dependencies or side effects that could interfere with other parts of the program.\n4. Testability: Functions are easier to test because they do not rely on external state or produce side effects, allowing for straightforward unit testing.\n5. Parallelism and Concurrency: Referential transparency facilitates parallel and concurrent programming, as functions can be executed independently without worrying about shared state or race conditions.\n6. Optimization: Compilers can optimize code more effectively, as they can safely replace function calls with their results or reorder operations without affecting the program's behavior.\n\nIn summary, referential transparency enhances the reliability, maintainability, and efficiency of functional programs by ensuring that functions are predictable, testable, and composable. Functional programming, based on mathematics and lambda calculus, focuses on breaking down problems into smaller parts, allowing for concise and logical code."}

Generally, patients are treated with sequential leg compression stockings and given a blood thinner prior to surgery. Both of these therapies continue throughout your hospitalization. The third major preventive measure involves getting the patient moving and out of bed as soon as possible after the operation to restore normal blood flow in the legs.\n2. What should I bring with me to the hospital?\nBasic toiletries (comb, toothbrush, etc.) and clothing may be provided by the hospital, but most people prefer to bring their own.

Please remember that ECHN is not responsible for lost belongings. Other ideas:\n1. What do I need to do to be successful after surgery?\nThe basic rules are simple and easy to follow:\n2. What's so important about exercise?\nWhen you have a weight loss surgery procedure, you lose weight because the amount of food energy (calories) you are able to eat is much less than your body needs to operate. It has to make up the difference by burning reserves or unused tissues. Your body will tend to burn any unused muscle before it begins to burn the fat it has saved up. If you do not exercise daily, your body will consume your unused muscle, and you will lose muscle mass and strength. Daily aerobic exercise for 20 minutes will communicate to your body that you want to use your muscles and force it to burn the fat instead.\n3. What is the right amount of exercise after weight loss surgery?\nMany patients are hesitant about exercising after surgery, but exercise is an essential component of success after surgery. Exercise actually begins on the afternoon of surgery - the patient must be out of bed and walking. The goal is to walk further on the next day, and progressively further every day after that, including the first few weeks at home. Patients are often released from medical restrictions and encouraged to begin exercising about two weeks after surgery, limited only by the level of wound discomfort. The type of exercise is dictated by the patient's overall condition.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:3b7ac93d-37f1-4129-8668-5f3e0633ae97>::chunk-6"]}, {"passage": "• Having a fear of closed spaces\nCatabasis Quarterly: Updates on edasalonexent and clinical trialsWe are pleased to announce that we have ...\nPrognostic Factors Affecting Duchenne Muscular DystrophyDetermination of prognostic factors affe...\nComparative Study of Clinical Endpoint in DMD: Handheld Myometry (HHM) Versus CINRG Quantitative Measurement System ...The aim of the proposed research is to c...\nKinesiology Taping in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Effects on Performance, Gait Characteristics, and Energy Consumpt...Investigators investigated that the effe...\nMuscle MRI in Becker Muscular Dystrophy and in Limb-girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2IThe purpose of this study is to investig...\nL-citrulline and Metformin in Becker’s Muscular DystrophyThe purpose of the study is to compare t...\nWhole Body Vibration Therapy in Boys With Duchenne Muscular DystrophyWhole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) is a...\nDuchenne UK: DMD Patient and Caregiver Survey Resultshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2EpSB8R...\nState-of-the-art advances in Duchenne muscular dystrophyDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a s...\nAntisense Therapeutics to commence muscular dystrophy trialsAntisense Therapeutics is planning to un...\nThe Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Equipoise, Fidelity and Standardshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji7Z23qH...", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:f3c286cb-9483-41c0-8cd5-a8f7a394480b>::chunk-4"]}, {"passage": "DelveInsight’s “Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast 2032” report delivers an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy market size, share, trends, and growth opportunities in the seven major markets (7MM) (i.e., the United States, EU4 (Germany, Spain, Italy, France), the United Kingdom and Japan).\nThe report covers emerging Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy drugs, current treatment practices, market share of individual therapies, and current & forecasted market size from 2019 to 2032.

It is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness and is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy.\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Symptom onset is in early childhood, usually between ages 3–5. The disease primarily affects boys, but in rare cases, it can affect girls. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked pattern because the gene that can carry a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-causing mutation is on the X chromosome. It is caused by mutations of the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy gene, leading to progressive muscle weakness, loss of independent ambulation by early teens, and premature death due to cardiorespiratory complications.\nSupportive and symptomatic measures are the basis of the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients at every stage of the disease and include non-drug, drug, and surgical procedures. Glucocorticoids have long been established as the standard in the therapy of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy Market Key Facts\nThe United States accounts for the largest market size of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, in comparison to EU5 (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, and Spain) and Japan.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:3589a46b-bd13-4470-adcc-7f789569340e>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Epidemiology Assessment\nThe epidemiology section provides insights into the historical, current, and forecasted Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy epidemiology trends in the seven major countries (7MM) from 2019 to 2032.

Your anesthesiologist should be aware that you have Duchenne. It is important to discuss the anesthesia plan with your anesthesiologist before any surgery or procedure that involves anesthesia.\nAdditionally, your neuromuscular team should always be made aware if you are undergoing surgery or a medical procedure. Additionally, you should have evaluations by your cardiologist and pulmonologist before undergoing any type of surgery or medical procedure. Any cardiac and/or respiratory abnormalities should be identified and optimally treated before any surgery or procedure involving anesthesia.\nThese recommendations have been reviewed and approved by the Professional Advisory Council of the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the U.S. (MHAUS). Discuss risks and benefits of planned anesthetic medications (agents) with your anesthesiologist.\nAnesthesia agents requiring caution in Duchenne\nPeople with Duchenne should NOT receive succinylcholine.\nThe drug succinylcholine (suxamethonium) is a depolarizing muscle relaxant. It is sometimes used in emergencies to relieve breathing difficulties in anesthetized patients. However, when succinylcholine is administered to patients with any kind of ongoing muscle atrophy, no matter the underlying cause, succinylcholine can cause severe, life-threatening (and sometimes fatal) increases in blood potassium.\nInstead of succinylcholine there are other commonly available muscle relaxants (e.g., any non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker) that can be used in emergency situations if necessary (see the “Safe” list section below). It is possible, however, that there exists a rare situation (such as life-threatening airway obstruction that requires immediate treatment) where an anesthesiologist may be justified in administering succinylcholine to a patient with Duchenne whose life is in imminent danger.\nAvoid inhaled anesthetic agents if possible.\nCommonly used inhaled anesthetic agents include Desflurane, Enflurane, Halothane, Isoflurane, and Sevoflurane.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:ff417041-b68c-4ed1-aee2-87bcebcf00b1>::chunk-0"]}], "final_prompt": "You are an accurate and reliable AI assistant that can answer questions with the help of external documents.

Generally, patients are treated with sequential leg compression stockings and given a blood thinner prior to surgery. Both of these therapies continue throughout your hospitalization. The third major preventive measure involves getting the patient moving and out of bed as soon as possible after the operation to restore normal blood flow in the legs.\n2. What should I bring with me to the hospital?\nBasic toiletries (comb, toothbrush, etc.) and clothing may be provided by the hospital, but most people prefer to bring their own. Choose clothes for your ride home that are easy to put on and take off. Because of your incision, your clothes may become stained by blood or other body fluids. Please remember that ECHN is not responsible for lost belongings. Other ideas:\n1. What do I need to do to be successful after surgery?\nThe basic rules are simple and easy to follow:\n2. What's so important about exercise?\nWhen you have a weight loss surgery procedure, you lose weight because the amount of food energy (calories) you are able to eat is much less than your body needs to operate. It has to make up the difference by burning reserves or unused tissues. Your body will tend to burn any unused muscle before it begins to burn the fat it has saved up. If you do not exercise daily, your body will consume your unused muscle, and you will lose muscle mass and strength. Daily aerobic exercise for 20 minutes will communicate to your body that you want to use your muscles and force it to burn the fat instead.\n3. What is the right amount of exercise after weight loss surgery?\nMany patients are hesitant about exercising after surgery, but exercise is an essential component of success after surgery. Exercise actually begins on the afternoon of surgery - the patient must be out of bed and walking. The goal is to walk further on the next day, and progressively further every day after that, including the first few weeks at home. Patients are often released from medical restrictions and encouraged to begin exercising about two weeks after surgery, limited only by the level of wound discomfort. The type of exercise is dictated by the patient's overall condition.\n\nDocument 7: • Having a fear of closed spaces\nCatabasis Quarterly: Updates on edasalonexent and clinical trialsWe are pleased to announce that we have ...\nPrognostic Factors Affecting Duchenne Muscular DystrophyDetermination of prognostic factors affe...\nComparative Study of Clinical Endpoint in DMD: Handheld Myometry (HHM) Versus CINRG Quantitative Measurement System ...The aim of the proposed research is to c...\nKinesiology Taping in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Effects on Performance, Gait Characteristics, and Energy Consumpt...Investigators investigated that the effe...\nMuscle MRI in Becker Muscular Dystrophy and in Limb-girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2IThe purpose of this study is to investig...\nL-citrulline and Metformin in Becker’s Muscular DystrophyThe purpose of the study is to compare t...\nWhole Body Vibration Therapy in Boys With Duchenne Muscular DystrophyWhole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) is a...\nDuchenne UK: DMD Patient and Caregiver Survey Resultshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2EpSB8R...\nState-of-the-art advances in Duchenne muscular dystrophyDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a s...\nAntisense Therapeutics to commence muscular dystrophy trialsAntisense Therapeutics is planning to un...\nThe Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Equipoise, Fidelity and Standardshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji7Z23qH...\n\nDocument 8: DelveInsight’s “Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Market Insights, Epidemiology, and Market Forecast 2032” report delivers an in-depth understanding of the disease, historical and forecasted epidemiology, as well as the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy market size, share, trends, and growth opportunities in the seven major markets (7MM) (i.e., the United States, EU4 (Germany, Spain, Italy, France), the United Kingdom and Japan).\nThe report covers emerging Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy drugs, current treatment practices, market share of individual therapies, and current & forecasted market size from 2019 to 2032. It also evaluates the current Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy treatment practice/algorithm, key drivers & barriers impacting the market growth, and unmet medical needs to curate the best of the opportunities and assess the underlying potential of the market.\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy: An Overview\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in children. It is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness and is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy.\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Symptom onset is in early childhood, usually between ages 3–5. The disease primarily affects boys, but in rare cases, it can affect girls. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked pattern because the gene that can carry a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-causing mutation is on the X chromosome. It is caused by mutations of the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy gene, leading to progressive muscle weakness, loss of independent ambulation by early teens, and premature death due to cardiorespiratory complications.\nSupportive and symptomatic measures are the basis of the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients at every stage of the disease and include non-drug, drug, and surgical procedures. Glucocorticoids have long been established as the standard in the therapy of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy Market Key Facts\nThe United States accounts for the largest market size of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, in comparison to EU5 (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, and Spain) and Japan.\n\nDocument 9: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Epidemiology Assessment\nThe epidemiology section provides insights into the historical, current, and forecasted Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy epidemiology trends in the seven major countries (7MM) from 2019 to 2032.

Should I perform rescue breathing or administer oxygen first?\nIf you are unsure whether the victim is breathing, begin rescue breathing, preferably in conjunction with oxygen therapy such as via a CPR mask. Administering oxygen via an oxygen mask to a victim who is not breathing could lead to respiratory arrest without rescue breathing.\n- The victim is not in respiratory or cardiac arrest, but appears to be having difficulty breathing. Should I administer oxygen?\nAdministering emergency oxygen to a victim who is having trouble breathing is one of the most important steps to preventing respiratory arrest.\n- What should I do if the victim cannot tolerate an oxygen mask?\nIf the victim cannot tolerate an oxygen mask covering her/his nose and mouth, hold the mask close to the nose and mouth and most of the oxygen will still be available to the victim to breathe.\n- If I am not sure whether to administer emergency oxygen, what should I do?\nWhen in doubt, administer emergency oxygen. It is not harmful, and it has the potential to prevent further damage and to save lives.\n- Do I need a prescription from a doctor to keep emergency oxygen on hand and to administer it in a life-threatening emergency?\nOxygen is only considered a drug in the event that it is administered in concentrations above the level of the air we normally breathe and when used as a medical treatment. The Food and Drug Adminstration (FDA) requires a prescription for oxygen used as a medical treatment, but has exempted emergency oxygen in life-threatening situations.

In health conditions like COPD, cystic fibrosis and sleep apnea, oxygen therapy is a life-saver.\n\nDocument 13: Surgery & Anesthesia\nWhen a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy has general anesthesia, a number of issues should be considered, including cardiac and pulmonary function, anesthesia, and the potential for blood loss.\nConsiderations for Surgery & Anesthesia\nIf you require surgery or a medical procedure, go to a medical center with expertise in the anesthetic management of people living with Duchenne if possible. Your anesthesiologist should be aware that you have Duchenne. It is important to discuss the anesthesia plan with your anesthesiologist before any surgery or procedure that involves anesthesia.\nAdditionally, your neuromuscular team should always be made aware if you are undergoing surgery or a medical procedure. Additionally, you should have evaluations by your cardiologist and pulmonologist before undergoing any type of surgery or medical procedure. Any cardiac and/or respiratory abnormalities should be identified and optimally treated before any surgery or procedure involving anesthesia.\nThese recommendations have been reviewed and approved by the Professional Advisory Council of the Malignant Hyperthermia Association of the U.S. (MHAUS). Discuss risks and benefits of planned anesthetic medications (agents) with your anesthesiologist.\nAnesthesia agents requiring caution in Duchenne\nPeople with Duchenne should NOT receive succinylcholine.\nThe drug succinylcholine (suxamethonium) is a depolarizing muscle relaxant. It is sometimes used in emergencies to relieve breathing difficulties in anesthetized patients. However, when succinylcholine is administered to patients with any kind of ongoing muscle atrophy, no matter the underlying cause, succinylcholine can cause severe, life-threatening (and sometimes fatal) increases in blood potassium.\nInstead of succinylcholine there are other commonly available muscle relaxants (e.g., any non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocker) that can be used in emergency situations if necessary (see the “Safe” list section below). It is possible, however, that there exists a rare situation (such as life-threatening airway obstruction that requires immediate treatment) where an anesthesiologist may be justified in administering succinylcholine to a patient with Duchenne whose life is in imminent danger.\nAvoid inhaled anesthetic agents if possible.\nCommonly used inhaled anesthetic agents include Desflurane, Enflurane, Halothane, Isoflurane, and Sevoflurane.\n\nQuestion: What precautions should be taken when using supplemental oxygen during surgery for someone with Duchenne muscular dystrophy?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "When using supplemental oxygen during surgery for someone with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, it is crucial to consider the patient's cardiac and pulmonary function due to the potential for underlying cardiovascular and respiratory issues. Silent coronary artery disease and the risk of immersion pulmonary edema recurrence are significant concerns that necessitate a thorough preoperative assessment. Shortness of breath might indicate an underlying lung infection or other systemic issues, reinforcing the necessity for a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's respiratory status.\n\nInhaled anesthetic agents should be avoided if possible, as they may pose risks to patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Close communication among the medical team, including the anesthesiologist, neuromuscular team, cardiologist, and pulmonologist, is essential to ensure optimal treatment of any cardiac and respiratory abnormalities. A comprehensive preoperative evaluation, involving specialists, is crucial to ensure the safety of the patient undergoing surgery.\n\nRegarding health coverage, the Affordable Care Act has allowed millions of Americans to gain access to health insurance, including those with preexisting conditions and young adults who can stay on their parents' plans until age 26. The Marketplace offers affordable options, with most participants paying less than $75 a month for coverage. However, competition in rural America for health insurance can be limited, with some counties having only one insurer participating in the Marketplace. Despite this, there are opportunities for competition within the offerings, and Medicaid expansion can provide alternative coverage.\n\nIn summary, precautions when using supplemental oxygen during surgery for someone with Duchenne muscular dystrophy include a thorough preoperative assessment by a multidisciplinary team, avoiding inhaled anesthetic agents, and ensuring close communication among the medical team. A comprehensive evaluation, involving specialists such as the neuromuscular team, cardiologist, and pulmonologist, is essential to ensure the safety of the patient undergoing surgery. Maintaining health coverage is important due to IRS enforcement of the individual mandate, which can result in fines for those without coverage. The importance of effective communication and collaboration among healthcare providers underscores the necessity of a comprehensive evaluation and coordinated care for patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy."}

How can we overcome the loss of light and color?\nThere are two answers to this question. One is to take the best possible picture using the available light, and the other is to use a “flash”. Using a “flash” is generally referred to as using a strobe in underwater photography. This chapter will concentrate on using available light.\nThe last chapter listed the ways that light gets diffused underwater. So, if we don’t have or can’t use a strobe we need to avoid all of the things that led to the light reduction. In other words, we need to shoot on a bright day, when the seas are calm, around midday. Luckily, if you are engaged in Key largo scuba diving, these conditions occur fairly frequently. This turtle to the left was taken using only natural, or ambient light.\nAnother time when we can use natural light to our advantage is if we are photographing a very large subject.\nA strobe cannot cover enough area to light these three sperm whales, so that a photograph taken with available light looks quite natural.\nScuba Diving wrecks provide another example of a large subject that looks good when taken in natural light. Sometimes, this natural lighting can be used to produce a black and white image that is quite dramatic, overcoming the lack of color at depth. This picture was taken while scuba diving the wreck of the Duane in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary.\nIn addition to pictures of big things, silhouettes can make an interesting subject for natural light photographs. This picture of Christ of The Abyss on Key Largo Dry Rocks was taken using only available light.\nThe Red Filter – A must for the Photographer While Scuba Diving\nOne thing to bear in mind in all these shots is that they obviously don’t work for vibrantly colored subjects. To take photographs of highly colored subjects, in addition to good light, we must have a shallow depth. There are however one or two tricks we can use to overcome color loss. The first is to use a red filter. This filter reduces that amount of light of all frequencies going into the camera except Red.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:51a2ed7e-75db-473c-8522-e282ec6811d0>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Coral taken with camera lens on a Iphone 12\nExploring Underwater camera\nFor those reefers who love to explore more in-depth and would like to take better quality photos, investing in an underwater camera would provide you the nearest take that you can find inside your reef tank.

However, digital cameras were not designed for underwater photography, so if you are using auto mode, you will need to keep a few things in mind.\nIt is not recommended that you use flash while underwater. You can still capture great underwater photos by staying shallow in the water, shooting your photos between 10 am and 2 pm and shooting with the sun to your back. If it is not a sunny day, you may not want to take photos that day, unless you have a strobe.\nWhether you are set on using auto mode or design to use manual mode, you should consider investing in at least one strobe. An external strobe will immediately and noticeably improve the quality of your digital photographs. A strobe is similar to a flash in that it produces artificial light, but the strobe is much more powerful.\nIf you are shooting in auto mode and are not using a strobe light, then filters can be very beneficial to you.

Gone are the days of having to load a roll of film, have it developed, and throw away the photos that didn’t turn out or that you just don’t like. Those types of underwater cameras are still available for those who choose to use them but technology has come a long way especially in the form of digital underwater cameras.\nDigital underwater cameras may not necessarily do a better job of taking photos under the water however it can save a lot of time and money. For one thing, with a digital camera, you can’t run out of film. We all know what a pain it can be to run out of film while trying to take photos underwater, even if you loaded new film before you take that first dive, you are still able to only take a specific number of photos before the film runs out. You have to then wait for the film to rewind and the camera to dry out before you can change the film rolls. With digital cameras, you don’t have to worry about any of that and with a large enough memory storage used, you can take literally hundreds of photos before running out of room.\nAlso, with actual 35mm film, you have to wait for the film to be processed before you can look at the photos. If certain photos didn’t turn out, you wasted your time and money getting it developed just to throw the photo in the trash. With a digital underwater camera, you have the ability to view the photos immediately to see if you need to retake it.

Some question wheat swimming in the sea is like, yet the do not want to learn exactly how to dive. Underwater photographers have taken it upon themselves to bring the undersea world to those that do not want to dive or never had the opportunity. While all digital photography is an art the underwater world needs special skills to bring the finest quality to life.\nUnlike wildlife digital photography the underwater world needs to be viewed up close. That is to say the marine life requires to be photographed closely. This is as a result of the water. The water refracts images commonly distorting them so the closer you are to your subject the much less water you have in between you an the subject. Undersea photography needs a good deal of persistence. You topic may swim quickly by like the shark, whale or dolphin, or they might hide with in the coral reefs bulging only when risk is not felt. Water holds bits, many generally living microorganisms called plankton since these particles usually drift by while you are attempting to take an image you can loose contrast as well as sharpness of the picture.\nMarine life makes use of the premise of hiding greater than rate or selection. This implies you will certainly frequently discover your subject masked rather than out in the open. You need to seek your subject with decision, without startling the topic. The underwater globe demands respect. You don’t want to touch the living organisms and consequently you need to find out to relocate with the present while trying to achieve the best shot. A lot of marine life will die if you touch it, specifically coral reefs so having a pastime of underwater photography requires you to adhere to the policies, a code of values.\nUndersea flash or even more commonly called a strobe can aid you gain the light you need to take an excellent photo. It is necessary to have a flash with an underwater camera. It will certainly assist you bring other colors as opposed to red and also orange into the picture. The strobe only requires to be medium sized, any kind of larger as well as it can hinder your image taking experience.\nMake-up is also very essential. You will certainly follow the exact same rule you performed in routine digital photography; nonetheless, you still need to have an upward angle on the subject. This returns to the camouflage technique of the majority of aquatic species.\n\nDocument 3: You don’t want to have to worry about fumbling around with unfamiliar buttons on the camera and miss that perfect shot. Once you learn to overcome all of the challenges and obstacles of underwater photography, you may just become the perfect underwater photographer!\nLearn Underwater Photography\nPeople take underwater photos for a variety of reasons. Some may take photos under the water just to capture the pure essence and beauty of the world that lives in the deep dark sea while others may use underwater photography to learn more about the environment down below and the species that live there.\nNo matter what reason you may have for taking photographs underwater, you are going to need to learn the ins and outs of this hobby before you will become good at it.

How can we overcome the loss of light and color?\nThere are two answers to this question. One is to take the best possible picture using the available light, and the other is to use a “flash”. Using a “flash” is generally referred to as using a strobe in underwater photography. This chapter will concentrate on using available light.\nThe last chapter listed the ways that light gets diffused underwater. So, if we don’t have or can’t use a strobe we need to avoid all of the things that led to the light reduction. In other words, we need to shoot on a bright day, when the seas are calm, around midday. Luckily, if you are engaged in Key largo scuba diving, these conditions occur fairly frequently. This turtle to the left was taken using only natural, or ambient light.\nAnother time when we can use natural light to our advantage is if we are photographing a very large subject.\nA strobe cannot cover enough area to light these three sperm whales, so that a photograph taken with available light looks quite natural.\nScuba Diving wrecks provide another example of a large subject that looks good when taken in natural light. Sometimes, this natural lighting can be used to produce a black and white image that is quite dramatic, overcoming the lack of color at depth. This picture was taken while scuba diving the wreck of the Duane in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary.\nIn addition to pictures of big things, silhouettes can make an interesting subject for natural light photographs. This picture of Christ of The Abyss on Key Largo Dry Rocks was taken using only available light.\nThe Red Filter – A must for the Photographer While Scuba Diving\nOne thing to bear in mind in all these shots is that they obviously don’t work for vibrantly colored subjects. To take photographs of highly colored subjects, in addition to good light, we must have a shallow depth. There are however one or two tricks we can use to overcome color loss. The first is to use a red filter. This filter reduces that amount of light of all frequencies going into the camera except Red.\n\nDocument 5: Many things need to be taken into consideration before you begin such as water depth that you will be shooting at, what angles are the best to use in the water, how to deal with lighting problems, and the best way to capture the bright beautiful colors that are waiting for you below sea level.\nThe best way for you to learn these skills is to talk to others who have experience with this type of photography. These people have experienced it for themselves and can teach you everything that you need to know to begin your journey as an underwater photographer.\nDigital Underwater Photography Tips\nPhotography has come a long way over the past decade or so especially when it comes to underwater photography.

Yes , i mean inside your tank, as these underwater camera, for example, the popular Olympus TG series is able to submerge fully into the water for your underwater photograph.\nNot only does a underwater camera allow me to take pictures underwater ,it also has varies function that allow better photography underwater, for example the white balance setting allows user to auto-filter the blue light effect .\nFor those using Olympus TG camera, i am going to share with you some tricks how to set the auto white balance easily .\nFirstly, point your camera to a clear white surface that has blue light background. Alternatively, You can also find place a white acrylic plate in the tank for the camera to be able to set the auto white balance. Press “Capture WB (Menu)” and save the setting!\nSetting the auto white balance function\nAnd thank god you only need to set this once, and the next time you take pictures with your camera, you can quickly select the filter effect and start taking imdiately.\nThe image on the left is taken with an auto white balance function, and the image is taken without the white balance function\nOther than being able to take photo underwater, some of the underwater camera has a macro shot mode which enable you to take up close up shot of your corals enabling you to see all the fine details of all the colors /polyps ect .\nTips for Reef photography\nNow we have suggested ways that prevent your photos that get too “Blue” , the next thing that affects your picture quality is the glass wall barrier that come between you and the corals that could affect the image quality. Subject to the thickness of the glass, the pictures you take might tend to be blurry and not focused even when you are using a good camera. So below are some trips you can use to improve your photography.\n- place your camera as close as possible to the glass or even touching it so that the autofocus function of the camera is not detecting the glass as the ” Object”.\n- If you do not have any camera lens or filter, adjust your lighting to warm white or a more natural white lighting. 12k and 14k lighting is good for photography.\n\nDocument 7: 3 Tips in Using Auto Mode for Underwater Photography\nAll digital cameras have an auto mode. However, digital cameras were not designed for underwater photography, so if you are using auto mode, you will need to keep a few things in mind.\nIt is not recommended that you use flash while underwater. You can still capture great underwater photos by staying shallow in the water, shooting your photos between 10 am and 2 pm and shooting with the sun to your back. If it is not a sunny day, you may not want to take photos that day, unless you have a strobe.\nWhether you are set on using auto mode or design to use manual mode, you should consider investing in at least one strobe. An external strobe will immediately and noticeably improve the quality of your digital photographs. A strobe is similar to a flash in that it produces artificial light, but the strobe is much more powerful.\nIf you are shooting in auto mode and are not using a strobe light, then filters can be very beneficial to you. Filters are small, colored gels that are placed in front of the camera lens. You can purchase filters that are specifically designed for underwater use and these filters will help you get good color in your photos.Popular Cameras for High Quality Photos:\n\nDocument 8: - Use an acrylic box, take your photo on top of the water surface.\n- Stop all pump and wavemaker in the tank\n- Do not use the zoom function unless necessary, as it will result in poorer quality picture.\nCamera Phone or Underwater camera?\nWe make an comparison between using a cameras phone and a Olympus camera to see the difference.\nImage Captured using iPhone 12 Pro with a coral lens\nimage Captured underwater, inside of the tank using Olympus TG-4 with auto white balance function\nThank you for reading my article.

Avoid using flash underwater as it can scatter and reduce image quality.\n3. **Employ a Red Filter**: A red filter can help overcome color loss underwater by reducing the amount of light of all frequencies except red, enhancing the visibility of vibrant colors.\n4. **Adjust White Balance**: For digital cameras, setting the auto white balance can help correct the blue light effect underwater.\n5. **Avoid Zooming**: Zooming in underwater can lower resolution and increase the blue effect. Instead, stay close to your subject with a wide-angle lens.\n6. **Use a Strobe or External Flash**: A strobe can significantly improve the quality of your underwater photos by providing additional light.\n7. **Position the Camera Close to the Glass**: When photographing through a glass tank wall, place the camera as close as possible to the glass to avoid blurriness.\n8. **Experiment with Lightroom**: Adjusting white balance, hue, saturation, contrast, and dynamic range in post-processing can enhance the quality of your underwater photos.\n9. **Choose the Right Settings**: For cameras with underwater modes, ensure you understand how these settings affect your photos, as they can sometimes cancel out the effects of external lighting.\n10. **Select the Best Subject and Setting**: Look for the perfect hole or setting for your subject to minimize distractions and enhance the photo's impact.\n\nTo address blurriness on your Kindle Fire, ensure your camera lens is clean and functioning properly, and consider the resolution differences between the camera and the screen. The Kindle Fire HDX features an 8 Megapixel OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) camera, which helps remove blurriness in photos from shaking and improves low-light photos. Additionally, the HDX display has dynamic image contrast, optimizing color based on surrounding light for better visibility indoors and outdoors.\n\nFor managing apps that may be causing excessive battery drain, consider using apps that can help identify and manage apps using unnecessary resources. There is also a \"Mayday\" button on Kindle Fire HDX tablets for live on-device tech support from an Amazon expert, which can assist with troubleshooting and optimizing app usage.\n\nBy integrating these strategies and features, you can enhance the clarity and quality of your photos both above and below water, as well as manage blurriness on your Kindle Fire effectively."}

How much of the human body is made up of stardust?\n'Since stardust atoms are the heavier elements, the percentage of star mass in our body is much more impressive. Most of the hydrogen in our body floats around in the form of water. The human body is about 60% water and hydrogen only accounts for 11% of that water mass. Even though water consists of two hydrogen atoms for every oxygen, hydrogen has much less mass.

An additional carrier material is not necessary due to the special processing. As a result, the hemostatic effect is 25% higher than that of classic chitosan products.\nActive ingredient chitosan\nChitosan, also known as poliglusam, poly-D-glucosamine or polyglucosamine, is a natural biopolymer of the polysaccharide family, first obtained in 1859 by boiling chitin with potassium hydroxide solution. Chitosan is also used in cosmetics and industry, and in medicine as an absorbable suture material in addition to its use as a hemostatic agent. Unlike other hemostatic agents (hemostyptics), chitosan does not activate the body’s own blood clotting factors. The hemostatic effect is based on several properties:\n– High absorption capacity: binding of liquids, fats and proteins\n– Film forming\n– Concentration of clotting factors and blood solids in the wound due to moisture deprivation/binding.\n– Electrophysiological reaction = cationically charged chitosan additionally promotes the concentration of anionically charged blood coagulation factors in the wound\nChitosan also works reliably at lower blood temperatures or when using anticoagulants such as Marcumar or Heparin.\nApplication of ChitoSAM 100\nThe ChitoSAM tissue is pressed directly onto the bleeding wound for several minutes. This binds blood and wound fluid and causes grafting. This is a great advantage for subsequent wound treatment in a rescue center or hospital, as the gel-like plug can be easily removed. Due to the high absorption capacity of the active ingredient, care must be taken in the case of head injuries to ensure that the dressing material does not come into contact with the eyes.\nChitoSAM 100 is atoxic, anti-allergenic, 100% biodegradable and can therefore be used without hesitation.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:586c045d-7aa2-4b23-add9-e6670ad5c565>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Chitosan is the active agent in Tricol Biomedical’s HemCon and OneStop hemostasis products and in order to understand how it works, you should first know about chitin. Chitin is the second most abundant naturally occurring biopolymer, after cellulose. In the natural world, chitin functions as scaffold material that gives structure and strength to insect exoskeletons and crustacean shells, and it is also found in mushrooms. It is often found in association with the mineral calcium carbonate. Our chitin is sourced from shrimp shells of the species Pandalus Borealis. The species naming being a reference to the Aurora Borealis found in the sky above the pristine waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The shells that are received for processing at Primex in the very north of Iceland are caught under carefully regulated quota systems that leave a sustainable balance to the marine environment. These quotas are based on scientific criteria for sustainable utilization of natural resources and the dedicated work of the Marine Research Institute.\nOnce the chitin is extracted from the shells, it undergoes a process called de-acetylation that molecularly transforms the chitin to chitosan. So now that we know where Chitosan comes from, what exactly is it? Chitosan is a natural biopolymer that possesses a positive molecular charge and is the hemostatic component in HemCon bandages and coated gauzes. This positive molecular charge is the basis of chitosan’s medical uses. For bandage and gauze products like ours, the positive charge attracts negatively-charged blood cells like a magnet, rapidly creating a tight seal over an injury.\nOften a first reaction to the use of Chitosan in medical devices are concerns with shellfish allergies. Most allergic reactions to shellfish are caused by the protein part of the shellfish, not by the shells. Any residual proteins are eliminated during the conversion of chitin to chitosan. There have been no reported cases of an allergic reaction to our chitosan products in the 20 years we have made them.

In recent years, chitosan and moringa oleifera have been applied as coagulant in water treatment 4. Chitosan is a derivative of chitin which naturally occurs in shells of crustaceans, fungi and insects. Chitosan is obtained from partial deacetylation of chitin which is removal of acetyl groups (-CH3CO) on N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) units of chitin polymer to reveal amino groups (-NH2) (as shown in Figure 1).\nFigure 1: De-acetylation of chitin to obtain chitosan, acetyl group (-CH3CO) on acetyl glucosamine monomer on chitin chain is removed to reveal amino group (-NH2) becoming glucosamine monomer making chitosan.\nIt is a long chain carbohydrate that is non-soluble in water but dissolves in most acids, and contains positively charged moieties. Possessing properties such as non-toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, chitosan has been studied for its application in many sectors such as industrial wastewater treatment, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, agriculture, and biomedical use.

Although effective, inorganic coagulants have several disadvantages, there has been a concern about the relation between aluminum residuals in treated water and Alzheimer disease and toxic effects of metallic coagulants on the aquatic environment. Hence nowadays, there has been great attention in the improvement of natural coagulants in treated water such as chitosan; chitosan is a natural linear cellulose-like copolymer of glucosamine and N-acetyl-glucosamine widely distributed in nature. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of chitosan on the removal of suspended solids (bentonite clay) from water. A series of batch flocculation tests with chitosan under different conditions was conducted. The results indicate that chitosan is a potent coagulant for bentonite suspension.

Unlike polyaluminium chloride, the efficiency of the natural coagulants is not affected by pH. The pH increased their efficiency, which is one of the advantages of natural coagulants. The principle behind the efficiency of the sago from the literature can be stated as follows: Sago starch is a natural polymer that is categorized as polyelectrolyte and can act as coagulant aid. Coagulant aid can be classified according to the ionization traits, which are the anions, cations, and amphoteric (with dual charges). Bratskaya et al.  mentioned that among the three groups, cation polymer is normally used to remove adsorbed negatively charged particles by attracting the adsorbed particles through electrostatic force. They discovered that anion polymer and those non-ionized cannot be used to coagulate negatively charged particles.\nThe chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction is influenced by the concentration of sago used; the lower the concentration the better the removal of the COD. Using less than 1.50 g L-1, better COD reduction is observed. At this low concentration, settling time did not influence the COD reduction. Similarly, concentration of sago used at lower than 1.50 g L-1 reduced the turbidity in less than 15 min of settling time.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:1c29a277-57c5-486d-9a10-1f3fa05b8de0>::chunk-9"]}, {"passage": "It is made from Chitosan, a 100% natural food fibre derived from the exoskeletons (shells) of deep sea Alaska King Crabs and Spiny Crabs in Japan.\nChitosan has been used for over 30 years by water purification plants as a process for detoxifying water.\nChitosan has a strongly positive polarity (electric charge), meaning that it acts like a powerful magnet to attract and bind to negatively charged hazardous substances.

Chitosan-based bandages control hemostasis and stop bleeding within minutes. The bandages’ antibacterial barrier properties may also help prevent infection at the incision site.\nChitosan, in a freeze-dried form, provides primary hemostasis by sealing the wound and stopping the bleeding. Specific chitosan dressings can create an adhesive structure with a positive charge that attracts red blood cells and platelets, which have a negative charge. As the red blood cells and platelets are drawn towards the chitosan through this ionic interaction, a strong seal forms at the dermal wound site. The platelets and red blood cells continue to be drawn towards the chitosan and form the frontline hemostatic support structure. The platelets and red blood cells will continue to aggregate until hemostasis and clotting occur.\nChitosan-based dressings have rapidly gained acceptance in military and traumatic wound settings where massive hemorrhage often leads to the depletion of clotting factors. Chitosan’s mechanism of action functions independently of either the intrinsic or extrinsic clotting cascades, and forms an immediate seal on wounds. This allows time for the patient’s native coagulation pathway to take effect. Furthermore, the use of chitosan has been implemented in order to address bleeding specifically while minimizing collateral tissue injury inherent with electrocautery.\nOne generally uses hemostatic bandages in the first 24 hours after removing the necrotic tissue and there is substantial bleeding at the wound site. After getting the initial heavy bleeding under control, one may apply moist dressings to promote wound healing. Wet-to-dry wound dressings can prevent infection but recent studies have shown that this method may actually enable bacterial proliferation.

An additional carrier material is not necessary due to the special processing. As a result, the hemostatic effect is 25% higher than that of classic chitosan products.\nActive ingredient chitosan\nChitosan, also known as poliglusam, poly-D-glucosamine or polyglucosamine, is a natural biopolymer of the polysaccharide family, first obtained in 1859 by boiling chitin with potassium hydroxide solution. Chitosan is also used in cosmetics and industry, and in medicine as an absorbable suture material in addition to its use as a hemostatic agent. Unlike other hemostatic agents (hemostyptics), chitosan does not activate the body’s own blood clotting factors. The hemostatic effect is based on several properties:\n– High absorption capacity: binding of liquids, fats and proteins\n– Film forming\n– Concentration of clotting factors and blood solids in the wound due to moisture deprivation/binding.\n– Electrophysiological reaction = cationically charged chitosan additionally promotes the concentration of anionically charged blood coagulation factors in the wound\nChitosan also works reliably at lower blood temperatures or when using anticoagulants such as Marcumar or Heparin.\nApplication of ChitoSAM 100\nThe ChitoSAM tissue is pressed directly onto the bleeding wound for several minutes. This binds blood and wound fluid and causes grafting. This is a great advantage for subsequent wound treatment in a rescue center or hospital, as the gel-like plug can be easily removed. Due to the high absorption capacity of the active ingredient, care must be taken in the case of head injuries to ensure that the dressing material does not come into contact with the eyes.\nChitoSAM 100 is atoxic, anti-allergenic, 100% biodegradable and can therefore be used without hesitation.\n\nDocument 2: It has been used as non-toxic floccules in the treatment of organically polluted wastewater .\nThe effects of coagulation process on hardness are observed for varying levels of hardness, which resulted in significant decrease of hardness removal. The study correlates with the results obtained by , wherein they had a maximum hardness removal of 84.3% by chitosan in low turbid water with initial hardness of about 204 mg/l as CaCO3.\nSeveral experiments were carried out to determine the comparative performance of chitosan on E. coli in different turbidities. E. coli negative is present in the chitin-treated waters in all of the turbidities. The conclusive evidence was found for the negative influence of chitosan on E. coli. The regrowth of E. coli was not observed in the experiments after 24 h, which was similar to the observations by .\nAs far as sago is considered, the starch was effective both individually and as blended coagulant. Unlike polyaluminium chloride, the efficiency of the natural coagulants is not affected by pH. The pH increased their efficiency, which is one of the advantages of natural coagulants. The principle behind the efficiency of the sago from the literature can be stated as follows: Sago starch is a natural polymer that is categorized as polyelectrolyte and can act as coagulant aid. Coagulant aid can be classified according to the ionization traits, which are the anions, cations, and amphoteric (with dual charges). Bratskaya et al.  mentioned that among the three groups, cation polymer is normally used to remove adsorbed negatively charged particles by attracting the adsorbed particles through electrostatic force. They discovered that anion polymer and those non-ionized cannot be used to coagulate negatively charged particles.\nThe chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction is influenced by the concentration of sago used; the lower the concentration the better the removal of the COD. Using less than 1.50 g L-1, better COD reduction is observed. At this low concentration, settling time did not influence the COD reduction. Similarly, concentration of sago used at lower than 1.50 g L-1 reduced the turbidity in less than 15 min of settling time.\n\nDocument 3: Chitosan is the active agent in Tricol Biomedical’s HemCon and OneStop hemostasis products and in order to understand how it works, you should first know about chitin. Chitin is the second most abundant naturally occurring biopolymer, after cellulose. In the natural world, chitin functions as scaffold material that gives structure and strength to insect exoskeletons and crustacean shells, and it is also found in mushrooms. It is often found in association with the mineral calcium carbonate. Our chitin is sourced from shrimp shells of the species Pandalus Borealis. The species naming being a reference to the Aurora Borealis found in the sky above the pristine waters of the North Atlantic Ocean. The shells that are received for processing at Primex in the very north of Iceland are caught under carefully regulated quota systems that leave a sustainable balance to the marine environment. These quotas are based on scientific criteria for sustainable utilization of natural resources and the dedicated work of the Marine Research Institute.\nOnce the chitin is extracted from the shells, it undergoes a process called de-acetylation that molecularly transforms the chitin to chitosan. So now that we know where Chitosan comes from, what exactly is it? Chitosan is a natural biopolymer that possesses a positive molecular charge and is the hemostatic component in HemCon bandages and coated gauzes. This positive molecular charge is the basis of chitosan’s medical uses. For bandage and gauze products like ours, the positive charge attracts negatively-charged blood cells like a magnet, rapidly creating a tight seal over an injury.\nOften a first reaction to the use of Chitosan in medical devices are concerns with shellfish allergies. Most allergic reactions to shellfish are caused by the protein part of the shellfish, not by the shells. Any residual proteins are eliminated during the conversion of chitin to chitosan. There have been no reported cases of an allergic reaction to our chitosan products in the 20 years we have made them. Keep an eye out for more detailed information to come on the use of chitosan by people with shellfish allergies!\nDue to chitosan’s many attractive properties such as its natural origin, abundance, and positive charge reactivity, it has a multitude of real-world applications.\n\nDocument 4: It is made from Chitosan, a 100% natural food fibre derived from the exoskeletons (shells) of deep sea Alaska King Crabs and Spiny Crabs in Japan.\nChitosan has been used for over 30 years by water purification plants as a process for detoxifying water.\nChitosan has a strongly positive polarity (electric charge), meaning that it acts like a powerful magnet to attract and bind to negatively charged hazardous substances. The resulting “bound” substance particles will be removed during washing and will not be absorbed by our bodies even if consumed.\nFor All Types of Food, some examples are:-\n- Rice – Removes polishing chemicals (e.g. talc), heavy metal residues, chemical fertilizers & pesticides.\n- Poultry & Meat – Eliminates chemical residues (e.g. antibiotics).

Coagulants normally in form of natural (as shown is Table 2) & inorganic (as in Table 3). Both coagulants aim to remove pollutant in form of physical (solids & turbidity) or chemical (BOD & COD).\nTable 2. Natural coagulants Efficiency\nTable 3. Inorganic Coagulants: Advantages and Disadvantages\nSome inorganic coagulants like Aluminum and iron are used in most industries, when aluminum is used as coagulant in water treatment, it can have caused several bad effect on human health such as intestinal constipation, loss of memory, convulsions, abdominal colic’s, loss of energy and learning difficulties. In recent years, chitosan and moringa oleifera have been applied as coagulant in water treatment 4. Chitosan is a derivative of chitin which naturally occurs in shells of crustaceans, fungi and insects. Chitosan is obtained from partial deacetylation of chitin which is removal of acetyl groups (-CH3CO) on N-acetyl glucosamine (GlcNAc) units of chitin polymer to reveal amino groups (-NH2) (as shown in Figure 1).\nFigure 1: De-acetylation of chitin to obtain chitosan, acetyl group (-CH3CO) on acetyl glucosamine monomer on chitin chain is removed to reveal amino group (-NH2) becoming glucosamine monomer making chitosan.\nIt is a long chain carbohydrate that is non-soluble in water but dissolves in most acids, and contains positively charged moieties. Possessing properties such as non-toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability, chitosan has been studied for its application in many sectors such as industrial wastewater treatment, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, agriculture, and biomedical use. Chitosan is a weak base and is insoluble in water and in organic solvent. However, it is soluble in dilute aqueous acidic solutions (PH<6.5), which can convert glucosamine units into soluble form R-NH3.\n\nDocument 6: INVESTIGATION / RESEARCH\nEffectiveness of chitosan as a natural coagulant in treating turbid waters\nAvailable from: http://dx.doi.org/10.21931/RB/2019.04.02.7\nAluminum, Lime and iron coagulants are commonly used in most industries for many decades to coagulate particles in surface water also removing turbidity from the water prior to flocculation, sedimentation or filtration. Although effective, inorganic coagulants have several disadvantages, there has been a concern about the relation between aluminum residuals in treated water and Alzheimer disease and toxic effects of metallic coagulants on the aquatic environment. Hence nowadays, there has been great attention in the improvement of natural coagulants in treated water such as chitosan; chitosan is a natural linear cellulose-like copolymer of glucosamine and N-acetyl-glucosamine widely distributed in nature. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of chitosan on the removal of suspended solids (bentonite clay) from water. A series of batch flocculation tests with chitosan under different conditions was conducted. The results indicate that chitosan is a potent coagulant for bentonite suspension. Coagulation of chitosan showed efficiency of 96.9%. The coagulant performed well at concentration of 1g chitosan/100 ml water at PH=6.\nKey words: Chitosan, coagulation, flocculation, bentonite, turbidity, water\nWater is a key substance in all natural and human activities, the production of potable water from rawest water sources usually use coagulation-flocculation techniques for removing turbidity in the form of suspended and colloidal materials.1. Coagulants are used that added to the water to withdraw the forces that stabilize the colloidal particles and causing the particles to suspend in the water 2. Once the coagulant is introduced in the water the individual colloids must aggregate and grow bigger so that the impurities can be settled down at the bottom of the beaker and separated from the water suspension (as shown in table 1).\nTable 1. Factors Affecting Coagulation\nVarious types of coagulants show potential application in treating water and wastewater. It ranges from chemical to non-chemical coagulant.\n\nDocument 7: The bandages are ideal for wounds that are prone to acute bleeding after mechanical and surgical debridement, and quickly stop a wide range of bleeding, from oozing to severe arterial bleeds.\nHow Do Chitosan-Based Hemostatic Dressings Work?\nIn regard to chitosan-based hemostatic wound dressings, chitosan is a naturally occurring biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide derived from chitin, the structural element in the exoskeleton of crustaceans. Chitosan-based bandages control hemostasis and stop bleeding within minutes. The bandages’ antibacterial barrier properties may also help prevent infection at the incision site.\nChitosan, in a freeze-dried form, provides primary hemostasis by sealing the wound and stopping the bleeding. Specific chitosan dressings can create an adhesive structure with a positive charge that attracts red blood cells and platelets, which have a negative charge. As the red blood cells and platelets are drawn towards the chitosan through this ionic interaction, a strong seal forms at the dermal wound site. The platelets and red blood cells continue to be drawn towards the chitosan and form the frontline hemostatic support structure. The platelets and red blood cells will continue to aggregate until hemostasis and clotting occur.\nChitosan-based dressings have rapidly gained acceptance in military and traumatic wound settings where massive hemorrhage often leads to the depletion of clotting factors. Chitosan’s mechanism of action functions independently of either the intrinsic or extrinsic clotting cascades, and forms an immediate seal on wounds. This allows time for the patient’s native coagulation pathway to take effect. Furthermore, the use of chitosan has been implemented in order to address bleeding specifically while minimizing collateral tissue injury inherent with electrocautery.\nOne generally uses hemostatic bandages in the first 24 hours after removing the necrotic tissue and there is substantial bleeding at the wound site. After getting the initial heavy bleeding under control, one may apply moist dressings to promote wound healing. Wet-to-dry wound dressings can prevent infection but recent studies have shown that this method may actually enable bacterial proliferation. Chitosan-based hemostatic bandages offer physicians an added advantage because they also have an antibacterial barrier.\n\nDocument 8: CHITOSANHC is a natural product resulting from a treatment of Chitin, in order to make this highly reactive and soluble in water.

Chitosan molecule has the ability to interact with bacterial surface and is adsorbed on the surface of the cells and stack on the microbial cell surface and forming impervious layer around the cell, leading to the block of the channels 5 , in addition chitosan has been studied for use as a coagulant or flocculants in river water and in wastewater. In laboratory studies chitosan has been reported to perform well as a coagulant for removing Chlorella sp. In algal turbid water 6, removing turbidity from sea water 7, and for microalgae harvesting 8. It has several industrial and commercial uses, can be recycled, and is an excellent chelating agent for many metals such as arsenic, molybdenum, cadmium, chromium, lead, and cobalt 9. The effective coagulation for turbidity removal was achieved in tap water when using lower doses of chitosan required for complete charge neutralization of the bentonite 10.\nFigure 2: Infrared spectra of chitin (A) and chitosan (B) (12)\nThe infrared (IR) absorption spectra of chitosan and chitin are presented in (figure 2). It can be observed that three types of absorption bands exist: the amide (I) bands of chitosan characterized by absorption at approximately 1655-1630 cm-1, the amide (II) bands of chitin at approximately 1560 cm-1 and the absorption bands for -OH groups at 3450 cm-1 11 and the presence of very reactive amino (-NH2) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups in its backbone, which makes chitosan to be used as an effective adsorbent material for the removal of water pollutants. Anionic particles of bentonite are electrostatically attracted by the protonated amino groups of chitosan 12. This reaction facilitates the neutralization of the anionic charges which can bind together and settle rapidly by the effect of gravity. The practical application of chitosan in terms of chitosan dose, PH, stirring and time effect. As water treatment coagulant is examined in the study presented here.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nPreparation of synthetic water\n10 gm.\n\nDocument 11: Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide that exhibits properties such as biodegradability, non-toxicity, biocompatibility, hemostatic and bio-adhesiveness and penetration enhancing properties. Moreover, it has anti-microbial properties\nAs per National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), deacetylated chitosan is a vital additive in filtration and water treatment which eliminates 99% of turbidity. Moreover, chitosan is an easily available product extracted from a waste product in fishery industry with several uses in other industries such as wound care material in pharmaceutical industries, acts as a natural flavor and used to control moisture in food industries leading to high demand of these polymer and further boost the overall market.\nFurthermore, as stringent government regulations are forcing manufactures to reduce plastic bag results in the growing demand for biodegradable plastic where chitin is being widely used. This led to the increasing adoption of chitosan and further drive the market growth over the forecast period.\nKey Market Trends\nUnder Application Water Treatment is Expected to Witness a Healthy Growth Rate Over the Forecast Period\nWater treatment is expected to witness healthy growth in the future attributing to the growing demand of chitosan in industries, commercial and municipal water treatment plants. Several advantages such as the ability to remove pesticides, surfactants, and phenol from the water making it highly preferable in water treatment plants. Increasing demand for chitosan as a water cleaner because of its non-toxic, non-allergic biodegradable nature will also be leading to propel the segment growth.\nThe presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in water and wastewater has recently been reported. The stools and masks of the COVID-19 patients were considered as the primary route of coronavirus transmission into water and wastewater.\nFor instance, according to a research article by Hai Nguyen Tran et al., published in Environmental Research Journal 2021, study confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in inflow wastewater. Although the existence of SARS-CoV-2 in water influents has been confirmed. Therefore, in future studies should focus on the survival of SARS-CoV-2 in water and wastewater under different operational conditions and whether the transmission from COVID-19-contaminated water to human is an emerging concern. Thus, use of chitosan for water treatment in near future is expected to encourgae to prevent viral diseases like COVID-19.\n\nDocument 12: Wastewater treatment applications\nChitosan’s functional groups and natural chelating properties make chitosan helpful in wastewater treatment by enabling the binding and elimination of metal ions such as copper, lead, mercury, and uranium from wastewater  It can also be used to breakdown food particles which contain protein and get rid of dyes and other adversely charged solids from wastewater streams and processing outlets.\nFood market applications\nChitosan’s chelating residential or commercial properties and high functionality make it valuable in numerous applications within the food market such as binding with and getting rid of specific elements, particles, and materials such as dyes and fats from foods.

It effectively purifies and deacidifies the body, stimulates the human defense mechanisms, does not allow cancer cells to multiply, lowers cholesterol, helps reduce body weight. With the help of chitosan it is possible to overcome many diseases with which modern medicine cannot cope.\nCHITOZIN FIT C contains liquid chitosan lactate in the form of oligomers. It is characterized by very high bioavailability and biochemical activity, which gives it the highest effectiveness among other known products containing chitosan.\n\nQuestion: What is chitosan and what are its key properties as a natural coagulant?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Chitosan is a natural biopolymer derived from chitin, primarily obtained from the exoskeletons of crustaceans. It is a cationic polysaccharide with a positive molecular charge, making it an effective natural coagulant. Key properties of chitosan as a coagulant include its ability to bind and remove negatively charged particles, non-toxicity, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. These characteristics make chitosan particularly effective in water treatment applications, such as reducing turbidity, removing heavy metals, and eliminating bacteria.\n\nChitosan's positive charge allows it to effectively neutralize and precipitate negatively charged particles, such as suspended solids and colloidal materials, which are common contaminants in water. This property makes chitosan particularly effective in reducing turbidity and improving water clarity. Moreover, chitosan's non-toxicity and biocompatibility make it an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic coagulants. Unlike some chemical coagulants, chitosan does not produce harmful byproducts during its coagulation process, contributing to a safer and more sustainable water treatment solution.\n\nIn addition to its water treatment applications, chitosan's unique properties have also been explored in other fields, such as pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and food technology, where its antimicrobial and biodegradable characteristics are advantageous.\n\nChitosan's effectiveness as a coagulant is influenced by factors such as pH, dosage, and the presence of natural compounds in the water being treated. Optimal pH for chitosan coagulation is typically around 6 to 7, where it demonstrates the highest efficiency in removing contaminants. The dosage of chitosan also plays a crucial role; higher doses can lead to restabilization of suspensions, reducing its effectiveness.\n\nChitosan's biocompatibility and biodegradability extend its utility beyond water treatment. It has been used in biomedical applications, such as sutures and artificial skins, and has been approved by the FDA for use in injury dressings. In agriculture, chitosan has shown promise in enhancing crop yield and reducing fungal infections. Its antimicrobial properties also make it useful in food preservation and as a bio-pesticide, contributing to sustainable farming practices.\n\nIn conclusion, chitosan's multifaceted properties make it a versatile and sustainable material with applications in water treatment, medicine, agriculture, and food technology. Its ability to effectively remove contaminants, coupled with its biocompatibility and biodegradability, positions chitosan as a valuable resource in various industries, promoting both environmental and health benefits.\n\nVisual representations of data can be misleading due to various design choices that manipulate the viewer's perception. For instance, altering the scale on the y-axis can exaggerate or minimize trends, while using 3D effects or non-standard graph types can distort the actual data. Additionally, omitting data points or selectively presenting data can lead to a biased interpretation.\n\nWhen interpreting graphs, it is crucial to evaluate several key elements to ensure accurate understanding. First, examine the scale and range of the axes to understand the true magnitude of changes. Second, consider the type of graph used and whether it is appropriate for the data being presented. Third, look for any missing data or outliers that could affect the interpretation. Lastly, assess the source of the data and any potential biases in its collection or presentation.\n\nBy critically analyzing these aspects, one can avoid being misled by potentially manipulative visual representations and draw more accurate conclusions from the data.\n\nIn summary, chitosan's properties as a natural coagulant make it a valuable resource in water treatment and other industries, while understanding how to critically evaluate visual data representations is essential for accurate interpretation and decision-making."}

The \"Guam Water Kids\" materials emphasize the importance of Guam's fresh water as a key resource, explain hydrological concepts, and introduce a sense of stewardship for conserving and protecting Guam's fresh water. These materials include a pre-recorded presentation, teacher's lesson plans and suggested activities, a Chamorro language glossary, and a companion website. The educational materials are correlated to learning standards recognized by the Guam Department of Education and have been approved for use in Guam public schools by the superintendent's office and announced in the GDOE newsletter. The materials were developed, in part, to support outreach efforts by WERI. There is a need to familiarize teachers with the materials and demonstrate the value of incorporating them into curriculum. Working directly with these educators will also increase awareness of WERI as a resource for water related issues and will open opportunities for WERI to engage educators in the future. As materials are employed and as teachers become engaged in water resource issues, an evaluation is needed to assess the effectiveness of the \"Guam Water Kids\" materials and to explore additional needs teachers may report such as a willingness to participate in water related courses for educators which may be developed in the future.\nSpecifically, we intend to follow the public schools' chain of approval, schedule a presentation targeted to reaching the 5th graders at each of the 6 elementary schools and follow the presentations with an evaluation by educators involved in teaching subjects related to water resource issues.

The municipal water bill dropped to just US$30 per month, and students had increased access to clean water for healthy habits such as hand-washing.\nThanks to experiences like this one, the value of WASH education is finally being recognized. The WASH Sustainability Charter gives WASH education top billing, with the preamble singling out “the lasting provision of safe water, sanitation, and hygiene education” as a “leading development priority of our time.” (For more information on the Charter, read this WASHfunders guest post.)\nGiven the growing influence of WASH education, finding ways to measure and evaluate educational programs and projects is also increasingly important and challenging. While it stands to reason that a populace educated in the basics of water, sanitation, and hygiene will be better able and more likely to actively participate in sustaining water provision projects, the evidence surrounding WASH education’s impact on behavior remains in early stages.\nAs a longtime proponent and provider of WASH education, the Project WET Foundation is exploring new and innovative ways to evaluate the results of its WASH education materials implementation. Targeting youth through school and community educators, Project WET materials, including educator guides and lesson plans, colorful children’s activity booklets, and durable classroom posters, teach children, parents, teachers, administrators, and government officials about WASH using games, songs, role-plays, whole-body learning, subject integration, and other interactive pedagogical methods. Educators learn to use the materials through a train-the-trainer process, and students share the lessons they learn at home and in the community. Materials have been translated and localized on three continents, reaching millions of children.\nSo what happens after the intervention? Getting to that answer is critical for all WASH education actors, but it is not easy. Partnerships and novel approaches can help.\nFollowing implementation in rural northern Uganda in 2009, Project WET used traditional site visit and survey techniques to evaluate results in 2010.

The \"Guam Water Kids\" materials emphasize the importance of Guam's fresh water as a key resource, explain hydrological concepts, and introduce a sense of stewardship for conserving and protecting Guam's fresh water. These materials include a pre-recorded presentation, teacher's lesson plans and suggested activities, a Chamorro language glossary, and a companion website. The educational materials are correlated to learning standards recognized by the Guam Department of Education and have been approved for use in Guam public schools by the superintendent's office and announced in the GDOE newsletter. The materials were developed, in part, to support outreach efforts by WERI. There is a need to familiarize teachers with the materials and demonstrate the value of incorporating them into curriculum. Working directly with these educators will also increase awareness of WERI as a resource for water related issues and will open opportunities for WERI to engage educators in the future. As materials are employed and as teachers become engaged in water resource issues, an evaluation is needed to assess the effectiveness of the \"Guam Water Kids\" materials and to explore additional needs teachers may report such as a willingness to participate in water related courses for educators which may be developed in the future.\nSpecifically, we intend to follow the public schools' chain of approval, schedule a presentation targeted to reaching the 5th graders at each of the 6 elementary schools and follow the presentations with an evaluation by educators involved in teaching subjects related to water resource issues. Procedures include: 1) contact and present materials to the principals at each of the six elementary schools in the Guam public school system for approval at the school level.\n\nDocument 2: Upon principal's approval, contact appropriate head teacher and schedule presentation to all fifth grade sections to be conducted in the spring 2010 and fall 2010 semesters; 2) conduct six team presentations of the \"Guam Water Kids\" program led by Ann Card and with WERI professionals serving as resource persons. Leave participating teachers with a packet of the educational materials including the CD presentation, printed copies of the two related Lesson Plans and Activities, and WERI contact information as appropriate; 3) conduct a survey of participating educators to evaluate the \"Guam Water Kids\" presentation and related lesson plans. Include additional questions about needs teachers may have and specifically poll interest in participating in future teacher training courses in water resources, a critical need which has been identified by the advisory council. The survey will be conducted online with an \"on paper\" option in order to facilitate participation. Contact information will be preserved in order to facilitate future communication with educators; 4) analyze and report survey results; 5) make any appropriate adjustments to existing \"Guam Water Kids\" materials indicated by educators' assessments.\nProgress/Completion Report, 2010, PDF\n\nDocument 3: As a class, they participate in an activity in which they discover the amount of drinkable water on Earth and are introduced to the water cycle.

The professional development workshops presented the Grouper Education Program, a marine sciences curriculum for intermediate/elementary (Year 4 & 5) and high school (Year 12 & 13) students. Nineteen teachers from 12 schools participated, including 2 schools from the Bahamas. Participants received the materials and resources necessary for successfully implementing the Grouper Education Program in their classrooms. This exciting project focuses on bringing the Nassau Grouper into elementary and high school classrooms through lesson plans and interactive live-feed video sessions that connect classrooms with scientists in the field.\nMr. Bradley Johnson, from Cayman Islands Department of Environment, presenting information to educators during the Grouper Education Workshop on Cayman Brac.\nThe curriculum presents a multi-faceted view of Nassau Grouper, in which students create their own understanding of this important fish. Key curricular concepts include the historical role of the species as an artisanal fishery throughout the Caribbean region, the grouper’s value as a keystone predator and its impact on local reef health, its role in today’s tourism-based economy in the Cayman Islands and throughout the Caribbean, and the conservation challenges facing Nassau Grouper given steep declines in populations.\nIn addition to classroom lessons, the program includes live-feed video sessions that take place at the Grouper Moon Project research site on Little Cayman, bringing real-world field science into the classroom. These video discussions are supplemented with footage of solitary Nassau Grouper on their home reef, and the 4,000+ mass aggregation of Nassau Grouper that gather on the west end of Little Cayman during winter full moons. While the bulk of the lessons take place over the course of the two weeks in January and February, when REEF and DOE scientists are working at the spawning site, the curriculum includes a set of pre-activities to help build background knowledge as well as follow-up lessons to help deepen the students’ learning experience.\nThe curriculum was developed to complement the research and scientific efforts of the Grouper Moon Project. Grouper Moon educator, Todd Bohannon, along with Grouper Moon scientists Brice Semmens, Ph.D.\n\nDocument 7: Applying the knowledge he and his students had gained, Aggrey was able to finally get the rainwater harvesting system implemented — to the benefit of the students’ health and the school’s budget. The municipal water bill dropped to just US$30 per month, and students had increased access to clean water for healthy habits such as hand-washing.\nThanks to experiences like this one, the value of WASH education is finally being recognized. The WASH Sustainability Charter gives WASH education top billing, with the preamble singling out “the lasting provision of safe water, sanitation, and hygiene education” as a “leading development priority of our time.” (For more information on the Charter, read this WASHfunders guest post.)\nGiven the growing influence of WASH education, finding ways to measure and evaluate educational programs and projects is also increasingly important and challenging. While it stands to reason that a populace educated in the basics of water, sanitation, and hygiene will be better able and more likely to actively participate in sustaining water provision projects, the evidence surrounding WASH education’s impact on behavior remains in early stages.\nAs a longtime proponent and provider of WASH education, the Project WET Foundation is exploring new and innovative ways to evaluate the results of its WASH education materials implementation. Targeting youth through school and community educators, Project WET materials, including educator guides and lesson plans, colorful children’s activity booklets, and durable classroom posters, teach children, parents, teachers, administrators, and government officials about WASH using games, songs, role-plays, whole-body learning, subject integration, and other interactive pedagogical methods. Educators learn to use the materials through a train-the-trainer process, and students share the lessons they learn at home and in the community. Materials have been translated and localized on three continents, reaching millions of children.\nSo what happens after the intervention? Getting to that answer is critical for all WASH education actors, but it is not easy. Partnerships and novel approaches can help.\nFollowing implementation in rural northern Uganda in 2009, Project WET used traditional site visit and survey techniques to evaluate results in 2010. However, recognizing the limitations of those techniques — particularly the lack of reliable internet connectivity for e-mail follow-up, the prevalence of teacher transfer, and the time constraints for staff — Project WET teamed up with Adam Lerer, a PhD candidate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\n\nDocument 8: In addition, individuals can learn how to treat ancient sites, as well as monuments and other public places that are historically significant, with care and respect. They can see that cultural heritage is fragile and needs to be protected, and recognize natural and manmade threats to cultural heritage, including pollution, urban development, vandalism and neglect.\n- Partnerships can be formed in the community to support historic preservation. By working with members in the business community, private organizations, nonprofits and government agencies, there are many ways relationships can be formed to revitalize interest and support for preserving Guamʼs ancient sites. Good legislation is needed to protect endangered sites. Cooperation between site managers, educators and community leaders can help mitigate the problems caused by activities or growth that damage or harm historic sites. Preservation requires community effort, specialized equipment and support that private companies can provide to offset costs.\n- Young people can participate in historic preservation and understand their role and responsibility in helping preserve Guamʼs ancient sites. The future of Guamʼs heritage will fall to its young people, who will then be tasked with passing on the legacy to future generations. By encouraging Guamʼs young people to actively engage in history and appreciating the islandʼs unique historic sites, they can better prepare themselves to be the best defenders of their own heritage.\nBy working together, the Hassoʼ: Chamorro Heritage Sites Project will provide digital access to different historic sites on Guam through the power of internet and video technology. It represents a collaborative effort of Guampedia and the local community to think creatively about the issues surrounding heritage sites and cultural preservation. Additionally, the project promotes awareness and community responsibility for ensuring continuous and appropriate care for these important cultural resources.\nHeritage Site Entries\nLesson Plan: Historical and Cultural Heritage Sites Film Project, Sumay (Middle/High School Level)\nLesson Plan: Historical and Cultural Heritage Sites Film Project, Ritidian (Middle/High School Level)\nLesson Plan: Historical and Cultural Heritage Sites Film Project (University/College Level)\n\nDocument 9: Students compare aspects of school and home life in the United States with those in Tanzania.

They create similar tools themselves, and think critically about the differences and similarities between human and other primate tool use.\nStudents discover the 3 heritages of Africa. For this African studies lesson plan, students discover how these heritages combine in African culture as they examine the Oral History and the Bakari Scrapbook in which Bakari’s life comes alive and then identify how the three heritages influenced Bakari’s life.\nYoung scholars create a family history report. In this ancestry lesson, students interview family members and report their own personal family tree. Young scholars present family artifacts to the class.\nStudents read articles to examine refugee life for Rwandans in Tanzania and Somalis in Ethiopia. They compare their own lives to the living conditions of the refugees and discuss basic human rights.\nIn this famous person worksheet, learners read a passage about Dian Fossey and then complete a variety of in-class and homework activities to support comprehension, including partner interviews, spelling, cloze, synonym matches, and scrambled sentences.\n\nDocument 10: In partial fulfillment of the requirements for the course\nED355, Language Arts Methods\nDivision of the School of Education\nUniversity of Guam\nDr. Jacqui Cyrus\nNovember 21, 2007\nI found a wonderful lesson on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s website, under teacher’s resources “The Quest for Less” that is relevant to current issues and interesting enough to capture the imagination of an eleven-year-old. Armed with a lesson, there were key questions to address. What do I know about my students? What accommodations and modifications will I need to make? What do the students already know that will enable them to complete the lesson? What do I want them to learn? What media and materials will they need to complete the lesson? How will they utilize the media and materials? How will I get them to participate? How will the lesson be evaluated?\nI based the hypothetical assumptions about my student’s SES, ethnicity, and gender on the “Tamuning Elementary School’s Annual Report Card” retrieved from the Guam Public School website linked to the Superintendent’s page. The learning styles are hypothetical. After reviewing web-posted Individual Educational Plans examples for an autistic student and a paraplegic student, I specified accommodations and made modifications to the lesson plan to meet the IEP requirements.\nTo determine the prior knowledge of the students regarding natural resources, environmental issues, conservation, and computer technology I reviewed the Guam Public School System’s Standards. Based on the standards I was able to make certain assumptions about what the students already know.\nThe overt lesson plan objectives are reflective of the assignment criteria, that is, reading and writing, speaking and listening. This presented a major challenge. While the task of compiling one paragraph of research on a specific topic given the source of the information sounds easy enough to accomplish in a single class period, it did not turn out to be a realistic expectation. In retrospect, having them print, read, rewrite, and recite would have probably been more expedient. However, the research process and collaboration are the real learning experiences, not the regurgitation of given information. . In addition, it was necessary to incorporate technology research tools, in this case, specifically related to the National Educational Technology Standard and Performance Indicators for Teachers (NETS*T) “I.\n\nDocument 11: Lesson Plan: Understanding Culture\nPrint version of this lesson plan.\nMicronesia: Understanding Its People and Culture\nBy Marlou G.

Publicly Released: Oct 12, 2000.\nThe federal government is an important sponsor of math and science education for elementary and secondary school students. GAO identified at least 61 federally funded projects that are designed to improve students' skills in these key areas. The materials in these projects are taught over the course of a partial school year, single school year, or multiple school years. Algebra, calculus, and basic math are a few of the subjects being taught students through grade 12. In the science programs, students are exposed to biology, astronomy, and natural science. Federal agencies generally support programs that are relevant to their own agency missions. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency funds programs that teach students about water quality and conservation, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration funds the Astronomy Village, a multimedia program that teaches students about stars and stellar evolution.\n\nDocument 13: Developed by The World’s Largest Lesson and the UN Environment Programme, the lesson provides comprehensive background information on the issue and encourages young people to brainstorm and come up with ideas for ways they can make a difference in reducing marine pollution.\nYouth can dive deeper into the issue and see an example of the positive impact other young people are having on the issue by learning about Melati and Isabel Wijsen, two sisters whose efforts have led to Bali deciding to go plastic bag-free by 2018. At the ages of 10 and 12, the sisters formed the organization Bye Bye Plastic Bags in order to “get the people of Bali to say no to plastic bags.” Their efforts have reached over 5.5 million people to date.\n4-H Grab and Go: Ocean in a Bottle\n4-H Grab and Go: Ocean in a Bottle is a short activity for middle school-aged youth that can be used to explore a variety of different science concepts, including oil spills and aquatic environments. The activity is a part of Exploring Your Environment, a larger 4-H curriculum that “explores environmental questions or issues and allows youth to jump right into activities that focus on real-world issues.” The Ocean in a Bottle activity is available as a free download, and the Exploring Your Environment is available to purchase from Shop 4-H.\nThrough these and other related educational experiences, young people can learn about challenging global issues they and other youth can have a positive impact on through their leadership and engagement. This can be done by engaging in projects within their own community that are related to larger global issues. By doing so, youth are able to improve their local community and join other young people around the world as positive global citizens who are helping to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\nTo learn about the positive impact of Michigan 4-H youth leadership, citizenship and service and global and cultural education programs, read our 2016 Impact Report: “Developing Civically Engaged Leaders.” Additional impact reports, highlighting even more ways Michigan State University Extension and Michigan 4-H have positively impacted individuals and communities in 2016, can be downloaded from the MSU Extension website.\n\nDocument 14: Water for Health was the topic of the day at St Peter’s Primary School in Moy when NI Water’s education team recently paid a visit.\nNI Water’s educational programme, H2O and the Wonderful World of Water, teaches children about the importance of drinking water and how to identify the symptoms and effects of dehydration.\nThe children were introduced to H 2 0, a water drop figure and mascot for the programme.\nThey also took part in practical demonstrations and games to explain how much water children should drink each day and how much of the body is made up of water. After discussing both tap and bottled water, pupils took part in a taste test to see if they could tell the difference. Each pupil received a re-usable NI Water bottle.\nNI Water’s Environmental Education Manager, Jane Jackson said: “NI Water places great importance on educating young people in the vital role water plays in our lives. H 2 O is a fun way for children to learn about why water is essential for good health and how they can help to conserve this precious resource.\n“We are delighted with the positive feedback we have received from schools who have participated in our education programme. It’s a fantastic way for us to work within the local community and educate future generations of water users!”\nThe programme is aimed at Key Stage 2 and designed to complement a key element of the Northern Ireland Primary Curriculum – the ‘World Around Us’.\nA teachers’ learning pack, with further classroom activities is available to download from\n\nDocument 15: The lack of localized educational materials is more evident in indigenous peoples (IP) communities, where available learning materials are not contextualized. This is the reason why Smart developed Matigsalug, the first app of its kind that showcases songs, dances and chants from the Matigsalug ethnic groups of Davao and Bukidnon.\nWith the app, users can learn how to properly pronounce Matigsalug letters and numbers and write them through app-tracing games. It was created in partnership with Matigsalug communities of Sitio Contract, Datu Salumay, Marilog District in Davao, Pamulaan Center of IP Education, ACLC College Davao and Gensan and Skeptron Business Solutions.\nAside from these five, Smart intends to launch more literacy apps in 2019. Among those in the pipeline include Sanut Ilokano for Ilokano-speaking regions, Gnare Blaan and Tagakaulo for children of Sarangani and the Singsing Kapampangan app.\nDigital portable classrooms\nThe targeted primary beneficiaries of the literacy apps are students, teachers, and parents of learning communities under Smart’s School-in-a-Bag, a portable digital classroom designed to facilitate learning in basic education. The applications are delivered through the said digital portable classrooms that contain a teacher’s laptop, student tablets, a projector, DVD player and pocket Wi-Fi.\nThe devices are preloaded with educational content, while schools with no sufficient electricity also receive solar panels. School-in-a-Bag beneficiaries also receive Dynamic Learning Program modules, teacher training courses and regular monitoring and evaluation.\nNo learner left behind\n“Our mission is to develop mother tongue-based apps as interactive tools that can help support learning strategies, as well as help preserve and promote local culture and heritage for the present and future generation,” Isberto explained.\nSmart emphasized how strong partnerships with community stakeholders are essential in developing Learn Smart programs.\nThe mother tongue-based apps are available for download on Google Play.

{"id": 21, "question": "What are the main advantages of using automated RTM (Resin Transfer Molding) over traditional prepreg manufacturing for aircraft seat structures?", "passages": [{"passage": "Improving one-piece aerostructures by automating preforming\nIsrael Aerospace Industries (IAI, Tel Aviv, Israel) has produced crashworthy seat structures for aircraft since 1978. Its turnkey service includes design, certification and manufacturing. IAI has developed a reputation for producing lightweight seating through the use of composites, and developed efficient production via RTM but now augments both with automation.\n“The idea was to implement ‘one-shot’ technology, manufacturing a part in a single, automated process,” explains IAI development program manager Hary Rosenfeld. IAI already had acquired expertise in resin transfer molding (RTM) during development of the 2.8m-long, one-piece composite rudder it now produces for the Gulfstream G250 business jet (see “RTM showcase: One-Piece Rudder”). “We know how to design parts for RTM,” says Rosenfeld, “but now we wanted to automate the preforming as well.”\nFor a test case, IAI selected an in-process composite helicopter cockpit seat. “We chose a helicopter seat because we already had this part designed in prepreg, so we could compare the weight and cost for parts made with prepreg and autoclave cure vs. the consolidated design using automated RTM.” The resulting seat reduces cost by 30% vs. its prepreg predecessor while maintaining critical strength and crash performance, and shaving weight by 7%.\nPart and process design\nRosenfeld points out there is a strong relationship between the design of the automated production line and that of the part. “The part geometry was challenging with regard to creating the prepreg layup,” he explains. “When you try to fold the prepreg material into a corner, it wants to wrinkle. So, you have to cut darts. But these reduce the strength of the part and you have to then compensate for this.” RTM offered improvements by moving away from prepreg layup, but there were new considerations. Forming was still required, but using dry fabrics instead of prepregs improved drapeability, reducing the need for manipulations such as darts. The process was also amenable to automation, but Rosenfeld notes, “we had to keep in mind what a robot can do.”\nA key aspect of composite aerostructures design is certification. “We must certify the part and the production line,” says Rosenfeld. “Most parts are certified together with the airplane they fly on.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:bd0d746a-8070-4fca-add5-bc36283fa5df>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Henkel has developed a polyurethane-based composite matrix resin that cures faster than the traditional epoxy resins. Composites based on carbon fiber or glass fiber are gaining momentum in various application areas due to the opportunity for enormous weight savings over traditional part construction, with no loss in mechanical performance. Starting in aerospace where pre-impregnated fibers (prepregs) are manually laid up and then baked into composites, many different applications are now penetrating into the automotive industry. New manufacturing methods like resin transfer molding enable economic processes that are suited for high volume automotive production.\nFor the resin transfer molding process, Henkel has developed a new composite matrix resin based on polyurethane which enables improved economics and throughput in processing. Compared to standard epoxy matrix resins, the new Loctite MAX2 cures significantly faster. During injection, it also enables more efficient impregnation without stressing the fibers due to the lower viscosity of the resin.\nThe composite properties of Loctite MAX2 were specially developed to provide more flexibility as well as much higher impact resistance than traditional epoxy resins. Henkel is confident that these new generations of polyurethane matrix resins deliver significant benefits for fast and efficient manufacturing.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:08899d07-2fee-4d65-abc1-3f0d7d5f3ef2>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "This method offers the following advantages:\n(a) There is substantially no slippage between the wheels 3 and 4 and the laminate 27;\n(b) A sustained pressure is applied on the laminate during the cure stage;\n(c) Cooling takes place under pressure.\nAn elongated isotropic laminate of graphite epoxy is produced using the instant invention. The laminate is eight plies thick. The layup sequence is (0,+45,-45,90)s. This means there are eight plies with the graphite fibers in successive plies oriented in directions 0°,+45°,-45°,90°,-45°,+45°,0.degree. in that order. The graphite epoxy system chosen for this illustration is GY 70/934. Prepregs of GY 70/934 are commercially available. This prepreg has GY 70 graphite fibers and 934 epoxy. The temperature in chamber 7 is held between 275° F. and 350° F. Each of the annular wheels 3 and 4 has a diameter of six feet. They are radially squeezed against each other so as to form a contact length L of four feet. The annular wheels and the flexible means are designed to produce a pressure between 80 psi and 100 psi along the contact length L. The deformations in the annular wheels and the flexible means are temporary. The wheels are cooperatively rotated so that their peripheral velocity is four inches per hour. The annular wheels 3 and 4 are located in the heated chamber 7 so that the distance between points 24 and 25 is 2 feet 8 inches so that it takes the laminate eight hours to traverse from point 24 to point 25. Curing takes place between points 24 and 25. Between points 25 and 26 the laminate cools under pressure for four hours. Thereafter the cured laminate exits from between the wheels.\nThis example is offered for a widely used commercially available graphite epoxy composite. Faster processing is possible using epoxy systems that cure more rapidly.\nIt may be appreciated that more than one set of cooperatively rotating radially compliant annular wheels may be mounted on a pair of common shafts and placed in a heated chamber. With this arrangement a laminate is formed between each complementary set of cooperatively rotating annular wheels with the result that a plurality of laminates is laid up and cured simultaneously.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:809f6681-6179-44fc-af68-9c6ae0bb83d4>::chunk-5"]}, {"passage": "The operation requires separate manufacturing facilities, and the \"B\" stage material must be stored at low temperature and in sealed containers to avoid contact with moisture. The resins must be conditioned to a specific state of polymerization, and the process must be stopped to retain the \"tack\" condition over an extended period of time.\nIn the wet resin impregnation process, woven cloth or fiber is impregnated with a liquid resin that is catalyzed to process or cure in a short continuous period of time. In this process, the resin is impregnated by squeegee of ply by ply of a layup at the site of component fabrication. The impregnated material may be handled at room temperature or elevated temperature for a certain period during which the resin gels, followed by final curing either at room temperature or elevated temperature in the same tool or mold.\nA wet resin impregnation process referred to as resin transfer molding (RTM) is a process to saturate the fabric with resin using two-sided tooling that is usually metal to withstand extreme pressures needed to force the resin through the fabric. The tool may be heated in order to lower the viscosity of the resin, and large presses are utilized to hold the mold together. Heat is supplied with hot oil or heating elements placed in the mold. Because of the great hydraulic pressure that is generated as the resin is pushed into the fabric to saturate the fabric, the mold will try to expand outwardly and open the internal clearances when the resin is injected into the mold. If the mold is fabricated correctly, the resin will form a wave front and move across the fabric uniformly. However, if the machining clearances vary even a few hundred thousands of an inch, the fabric will be squeezed more in one area than another and the resin will move in the path of least resistance. The areas that are compressed too much will eventually form air pockets as the resin surrounds these areas and air voids form.\nCurrent RTM technology suffers from the unpredictability of the formation of the resin wave. Typically, aerospace grade parts using the RTM process are made with the same number of plies of fabric throughout the part. Placement of the fiber plies in the mold and machining of the mold must match precisely. If the number of fabric plies varies, the placement of ply changes must precisely match thickness changes in the mold itself.

The cycle time, including injection and mold cleaning, takes about 7 hours.\nThat automated preforming and RTM have succeeded in cutting seat cost vs. autoclaved prepreg is, perhaps, an obvious outcome, but the source of the 7% weight reduction? That was not so obvious. According to Rosenfeld, “This is due to very accurate plies. We optimized the part design for RTM, so there is not as much overlap in ply location and less material wasted. You also don’t have to factor in manual layup errors, so this reduces extra material as well.” He explains that the manual layup process has inaccuracies almost every time, but the robot is very predictable and less prone to errors.\nPart of what makes the robot so accurate is CAC’s “intelligent automation.” “We integrate a camera into the robotic arm,” says Thimon, “so that vision inspection is completed while preforming operations are ongoing. When you unroll material, it will check fiber orientation. It will also inspect during pick-and-place layup for fine positioning of the ply onto the tool/preform and for other defects in this part of the process, such as missing plies and incorrect fiber orientation.” IAI has worked with CAC to validate the inspection results. “It compares the visual images taken by the camera with the computer design file and shows any deviation,” says Rosenfeld. “CAC has developed a very good algorithm for this, and we have verified how well it works.”\nAlthough cycle time has already been reduced to one completed RTM seat per 8.5-hr shift, he believes this robotic inspection can eventually further reduce manual inspection times for even faster production. This automated RTM process also produces net-shaped parts with a high-quality finish on both sides, so the only post-molding operation is drilling a few holes. “We will also keep looking at newer resins that cure more quickly, like in automotive,” notes Rosenfeld.\nThe fabrication and installation of 700+ composite panels has a backstory of detailed design and careful quality assurance.\nThe old art behind this industry’s first fiber reinforcement is explained,with insights into new fiber science and future developments.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:bd0d746a-8070-4fca-add5-bc36283fa5df>::chunk-3"]}, {"passage": "Integrated fabrics, braids, preforms and pre-pregs are used in rapid fabrication of door inner, floor, seat back rest, roof, trunk and under the hood auto components, wind turbine blades and composite tanks (See Figure 3).

The next-generation technologies feature novel and increasingly complex combinations and formulations of fiber-reinforced composites, but these are difficult to recycle using current practices. Since recycled chopped carbon fiber costs 70-percent less to produce and uses up to 98-percent less energy to manufacture compared to virgin carbon fiber, recycling technologies are creating new markets from the estimated 29 million pounds of composite scrap sent to landfills annually. Advances in recycling technologies including pyrolysis, solvolysis, mechanical shredding and cement kiln incineration are enabling recycle, reuse, and remanufacture of products.

The RTM process is suitable for medium and big series production. The method consists of impregnating dry fibers (first cut and placed into the mold) with thermoset resin under pressure. RTM parts have accurate surface and high mechanical properties. This technology allows us to produce highly loaded parts with strict tolerances (for example, airplane engine parts).\nAdvantages and restrictions of the technology\nRTM technology requires the use of two-sided molds (punch and matrix). The high cost of mold production, together with a medium-level production rate, makes this technology expensive for part production. Nevertheless, this method is widely used in some industries because of its advantages:\n– The ability to produce complex, integrated parts with inserts, with sandwich structure (foam core) helps to shorten assembly time;\n– High accuracy (low tolerances) and almost no post-molding processing;\n– The ability to produce parts with a high thickness and complex shape, which is usually impossible with other methods;\n– The high mechanical properties and wear-resistance (lifetime) of produced parts, and low-porous surface;\n– Easily painted surface (up to Class A);\n– The quality is reproducible in big series manufacturing.\nDepending on the customer’s needs, several types of reinforcing materials can be used: various fabrics and mats made of glass, carbon, organic or basalt fibers. Polyester or epoxy resins with low viscosity are usually used as a matrix material.\nRTM parts have smooth, accurate surfaces on all sides. This method offers wide design possibilities with a properly designed mold and careful preform preparation.

The lower side is a rigid mould. The upper side can be a rigid or flexible mould. Flexible moulds can be made from composite materials, silicone or extruded polymer films such as nylon. The two sides fit together to produce a mold cavity. The distinguishing feature of resin transfer moulding is that the reinforcement materials are placed into this cavity and the mould set is closed prior to the introduction of matrix material. Resin transfer moulding includes numerous varieties which differ in the mechanics of how the resin is introduced to the reinforcement in the mould cavity.\nOther types of moulding include press moulding, transfer moulding, pultrusion moulding, filament winding, casting, centrifugal casting and continuous casting. There are also forming capabilities including CNC filament winding, vacuum infusion, wet lay-up, compression moulding, and thermoplastic moulding.\nLow-temperature-cure epoxy tooling prepregs, such as HX50 and HX70 from Amber Composites or LTM series from Advanced Composite Group, have now become benchmark products in aerospace, automotive, marine, industrial and motorsport applications. With their reliability long-proven, steady improvement has resulted in materials that are easy to handle and apply, provide Class-A surface finish, and offer surprising longevity of tool life. Some systems now enable 200°C end use temperatures, and recent advancements in materials have enabled composite tools to be compatible with an ever wider variety of processing methods.\nIllsey points to the example of F1 car builders and America's Cup boat builders.\n“F1 teams need a large number of small, complicated parts. Yacht builders may need a single 30 m long part. Both require extremely precise dimensions.

This paper describes an approach to utilise a basic geometry for several similar parts and add local reinforcement patches only in regions of load introduction or high local stress. The approach offers the benefit of being able to combine automated production methods with unprecedented design freedom. The specific bearing performance for three different local reinforcement using (1) add-on CFRP patches, (2) surface mounted steel foils and (3) steel foil interleaving in replacement of 90° plies with foils of the same thickness as the CFRP plies (0.125 mm) is compared by double lap bearing tests. The bearing strength improves with the addition of patches, for surface mounted steel foils, more so as CFRP co-cured patches, and most as an interleaved configuration. Quasi ductile failure of the bearing joints was maintained due to additional plasticity of the steel foils, producing a joint that fails safely while enhancing the bearing strength. When examining the hybrid laminates, all samples buckled and failed in bearing compression/shear. Brooming was evident on the compressive side of the hole where the bolt indented the laminate. Indentation led to shear kink bands along the washer supported region and appear as large compression/shear damage above the washer confined region of the laminate.

Rosenfeld explains: “The robot picks up plies in a predefined sequence per the design: Two glass fabric plies (face-up and face-down) and two carbon fabric plies (face-up and face-down), which achieve a symmetric laminate.” The synchronized system changes the rolls of fabric automatically as needed to keep the production line running. The system is set to cut a number of “boards,” which contain cuts (pieces) from the same roll, according to the specific layup stage. The number of cuts within a “board” varies between four and 30, depending on the layup configuration as defined per each layup stage. The cuts are nested to achieve maximum material usage and minimize waste. The fabric is also coated with thermoplastic powder to aid preform consolidation.\nThe robot then places the cut plies onto the heated mold to achieve a 3D shape. However, there is an important bit of innovation here: “We have developed specialized end-effectors that operate like hands,” explains Thimon, “allowing 2D materials to be folded and formed into complex-shaped areas like corners.” As part of the preform building process, periodic vacuum debulks are performed with a reusable membrane. Debulk of prepregs with the same membrane was an established step in the prepreg seat process. IAI found that it also worked well to consolidate the thermoplastic-coated fabrics into a high-quality preform.\nThe single work cell robot, with end effector now changed to trimming head, is then used to trim the preform to achieve a net-shape part. The trimmed preform is manually transferred to the bottom mold in the RTM press. “We apply vacuum and begin resin injection, using the Isojet injection machine,” says Rosenfeld.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:bd0d746a-8070-4fca-add5-bc36283fa5df>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "\"Applying the chopped material robotically right to the shape not only cuts the amount of scrap, but it's cheaper scrap.\" Since the preform is built right on the tool, the process eliminates the step required to transfer the finished preform from a manufacturing station to the part mold, so there is no risk of damage and no extra space is required to store preforms or preform tools.\nRIMFIRE + ZIP RTM\nIn production, RIMFIRE can be used with most available closed molding options, including standard resin transfer molding (RTM) and various methods of vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) and vacuum-assisted resin infusion molding (VARIM). Sea Ray currently uses ZIP RTM (zero injection pressure resin transfer molding) process, licensed from Plastech Thermoset Tectonics (Gunnislake, Plymouth, U.K.) and Plastech's North American partner JHM Technologies (Fenton, Mich.). ZIP RTM motivates resin flow with both vacuum and injection pressure, slightly favoring the vacuum, which results in less stress on the mold. This permits the use of less costly semi-rigid tooling. A multi-station inline system, ZIP RTM processes several lower molds simultaneously, but requires only two upper mold halves per line, keeping mold manufacturing costs to a minimum. (photos show construction of Sea Ray's 20-ft/6m 205 sport boat hull.)\nBefore production starts, technicians apply Chemlease (Chem-Trend, Howell, Mich.) or equivalent semipermanent release agents to upper and lower molds. Gel coat is applied to the lower mold and allowed to cure. Meanwhile, the specified fiberglass gun roving is loaded onto pallets behind the robot. Four rovings of continuous glass, typically 112- or 113-yield, are threaded through the end effector.\nIn a pre-loading station ahead of the RIMFIRE preforming cell, multiaxial glass fabric is laid into tight radii in the lower mold, if called for in the FEA, to prevent bridging of the preform spray over the angle. The mold is then latched onto a computer-controlled indexing device that rides on a floor-mounted rail, and is moved into the preform cell.\nAn operator starts the previously downloaded software program.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:1f8b07e2-a8d0-45db-a3e6-8278579841d7>::chunk-4"]}, {"passage": "The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner is composed of over 50% composites and some very large production tools are made of composite tooling prepreg.\nMore recently, companies are also able to consider developing very low cost composite tooling through the development of prepreg that can be processed without the need for autoclave pressure and without increasing resin volume. These are commonly known as out of autoclave (OOA) products. This technique is helpful when making large parts and when the integrity of the pattern/master cannot withstand the pressure of an autoclave.\nBenefits of composite tooling\nCompared with traditional metal tooling, composite tooling can provide a lower cost of production and easier handling and storage. For performance parts requiring accurate dimensions, composite tooling offers a CTE closer to the part CTE, helping the part maintain dimensional integrity during cure.\nCompared with a few years ago, composite tooling is more widely available, more user-friendly, and more efficient to process. Prepreg is now available with excellent drapeability enabling accurate reproduction of small radii corners, a wide range of tackiness, a wide range of curing temperatures, and a wide range of dimensions.\n“A great example application was the recent development of the ALMA telescopes to be placed in Chile”, says Illsley. “The telescope is comprised of a set of segments, each of which have to be identical and precise. In order to meet these exacting accuracy requirements, they used our HX50 tooling prepreg. And, to address the outlife challenges faced when working with such a large tool, we supplied the tooling prepreg in pre-cut squares.”\nAnother reason composite tooling is gaining popularity is the availability of a proven package solution.

Thermosetting resins are impregnated into the reinforcing material before curing, while the resinous materials are low in viscosity. Thermoset composites suffer from several disadvantages. Low molding pressures are used to prepare these composites to avoid damage to the fibers. These low pressures, however, make it difficult to suppress the formation of bubbles within the composite which can result in voids or defects in the matrix coating. Thus, most processing problems with thermoset composites are concerned with removing entrained air or volatiles so that a void-free matrix is produced. Thermoset composites made by the prepreg method require lengthy cure times with alternating pressures to control the flow of the resin as it thickens to prevent bubbles in the matrix. While current fabrication of large structures utilize robotic placement of the thermoset composite material to increase production rate, its overall production rate for the component is limited by the lengthy cure in the autoclave process step and related operations to prepare the material for that process step. Some high volume processes, such as resin infusion avoid the prepreg step but still require special equipment and materials along with constant monitoring of the process over the length of the cure time (e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,132,755, and 5,721,034). Although thermoset resins have enjoyed success as in lower volume composites applications, the difficulties in processing these resins has limited their use in larger volume applications.\nThermoplastic compositions, in contrast, are more difficult to impregnate into the reinforcing material because of comparatively higher viscosities. On the other hand, thermoplastic compositions offer a number of benefits over thermosetting compositions. For example, thermoplastic prepregs can be more rapidly fabricated into articles. Another advantage is that thermoplastic articles formed from such prepregs may be recycled. In addition, damage resistant composites with excellent performance in hot humid environments may be achieved by the proper selection of the thermoplastic matrix. Thermoplastic resins are long chain polymers of high molecular weight. These polymers are highly viscous when melted and are often non-Newtonian in their flow behavior.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:e5b1935b-ea86-4464-b3a2-4595eb616d7e>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "Another data point regarding the transition toward what may be considered non-traditional materials for automotive applications (unless, of course, said applications are for cars with (1) price tags that are generally at or above six figures or (2) use on Formula One circuits) comes from Dow Automotive Systems, which has recently opened two labs with a focus on developing carbon fiber composites.\nOne was opened in Freienbach, Switzerland.

Its turnkey service includes design, certification and manufacturing. IAI has developed a reputation for producing lightweight seating through the use of composites, and developed efficient production via RTM but now augments both with automation.\n“The idea was to implement ‘one-shot’ technology, manufacturing a part in a single, automated process,” explains IAI development program manager Hary Rosenfeld. IAI already had acquired expertise in resin transfer molding (RTM) during development of the 2.8m-long, one-piece composite rudder it now produces for the Gulfstream G250 business jet (see “RTM showcase: One-Piece Rudder”). “We know how to design parts for RTM,” says Rosenfeld, “but now we wanted to automate the preforming as well.”\nFor a test case, IAI selected an in-process composite helicopter cockpit seat. “We chose a helicopter seat because we already had this part designed in prepreg, so we could compare the weight and cost for parts made with prepreg and autoclave cure vs. the consolidated design using automated RTM.” The resulting seat reduces cost by 30% vs. its prepreg predecessor while maintaining critical strength and crash performance, and shaving weight by 7%.\nPart and process design\nRosenfeld points out there is a strong relationship between the design of the automated production line and that of the part. “The part geometry was challenging with regard to creating the prepreg layup,” he explains. “When you try to fold the prepreg material into a corner, it wants to wrinkle. So, you have to cut darts. But these reduce the strength of the part and you have to then compensate for this.” RTM offered improvements by moving away from prepreg layup, but there were new considerations. Forming was still required, but using dry fabrics instead of prepregs improved drapeability, reducing the need for manipulations such as darts. The process was also amenable to automation, but Rosenfeld notes, “we had to keep in mind what a robot can do.”\nA key aspect of composite aerostructures design is certification. “We must certify the part and the production line,” says Rosenfeld. “Most parts are certified together with the airplane they fly on.\n\nDocument 2: Henkel has developed a polyurethane-based composite matrix resin that cures faster than the traditional epoxy resins. Composites based on carbon fiber or glass fiber are gaining momentum in various application areas due to the opportunity for enormous weight savings over traditional part construction, with no loss in mechanical performance. Starting in aerospace where pre-impregnated fibers (prepregs) are manually laid up and then baked into composites, many different applications are now penetrating into the automotive industry. New manufacturing methods like resin transfer molding enable economic processes that are suited for high volume automotive production.\nFor the resin transfer molding process, Henkel has developed a new composite matrix resin based on polyurethane which enables improved economics and throughput in processing. Compared to standard epoxy matrix resins, the new Loctite MAX2 cures significantly faster. During injection, it also enables more efficient impregnation without stressing the fibers due to the lower viscosity of the resin.\nThe composite properties of Loctite MAX2 were specially developed to provide more flexibility as well as much higher impact resistance than traditional epoxy resins. Henkel is confident that these new generations of polyurethane matrix resins deliver significant benefits for fast and efficient manufacturing.\n\nDocument 3: This method offers the following advantages:\n(a) There is substantially no slippage between the wheels 3 and 4 and the laminate 27;\n(b) A sustained pressure is applied on the laminate during the cure stage;\n(c) Cooling takes place under pressure.\nAn elongated isotropic laminate of graphite epoxy is produced using the instant invention. The laminate is eight plies thick. The layup sequence is (0,+45,-45,90)s. This means there are eight plies with the graphite fibers in successive plies oriented in directions 0°,+45°,-45°,90°,-45°,+45°,0.degree. in that order. The graphite epoxy system chosen for this illustration is GY 70/934. Prepregs of GY 70/934 are commercially available. This prepreg has GY 70 graphite fibers and 934 epoxy. The temperature in chamber 7 is held between 275° F. and 350° F. Each of the annular wheels 3 and 4 has a diameter of six feet. They are radially squeezed against each other so as to form a contact length L of four feet. The annular wheels and the flexible means are designed to produce a pressure between 80 psi and 100 psi along the contact length L. The deformations in the annular wheels and the flexible means are temporary. The wheels are cooperatively rotated so that their peripheral velocity is four inches per hour. The annular wheels 3 and 4 are located in the heated chamber 7 so that the distance between points 24 and 25 is 2 feet 8 inches so that it takes the laminate eight hours to traverse from point 24 to point 25. Curing takes place between points 24 and 25. Between points 25 and 26 the laminate cools under pressure for four hours. Thereafter the cured laminate exits from between the wheels.\nThis example is offered for a widely used commercially available graphite epoxy composite. Faster processing is possible using epoxy systems that cure more rapidly.\nIt may be appreciated that more than one set of cooperatively rotating radially compliant annular wheels may be mounted on a pair of common shafts and placed in a heated chamber. With this arrangement a laminate is formed between each complementary set of cooperatively rotating annular wheels with the result that a plurality of laminates is laid up and cured simultaneously.\n\nDocument 4: The operation requires separate manufacturing facilities, and the \"B\" stage material must be stored at low temperature and in sealed containers to avoid contact with moisture. The resins must be conditioned to a specific state of polymerization, and the process must be stopped to retain the \"tack\" condition over an extended period of time.\nIn the wet resin impregnation process, woven cloth or fiber is impregnated with a liquid resin that is catalyzed to process or cure in a short continuous period of time. In this process, the resin is impregnated by squeegee of ply by ply of a layup at the site of component fabrication. The impregnated material may be handled at room temperature or elevated temperature for a certain period during which the resin gels, followed by final curing either at room temperature or elevated temperature in the same tool or mold.\nA wet resin impregnation process referred to as resin transfer molding (RTM) is a process to saturate the fabric with resin using two-sided tooling that is usually metal to withstand extreme pressures needed to force the resin through the fabric. The tool may be heated in order to lower the viscosity of the resin, and large presses are utilized to hold the mold together. Heat is supplied with hot oil or heating elements placed in the mold. Because of the great hydraulic pressure that is generated as the resin is pushed into the fabric to saturate the fabric, the mold will try to expand outwardly and open the internal clearances when the resin is injected into the mold. If the mold is fabricated correctly, the resin will form a wave front and move across the fabric uniformly. However, if the machining clearances vary even a few hundred thousands of an inch, the fabric will be squeezed more in one area than another and the resin will move in the path of least resistance. The areas that are compressed too much will eventually form air pockets as the resin surrounds these areas and air voids form.\nCurrent RTM technology suffers from the unpredictability of the formation of the resin wave. Typically, aerospace grade parts using the RTM process are made with the same number of plies of fabric throughout the part. Placement of the fiber plies in the mold and machining of the mold must match precisely. If the number of fabric plies varies, the placement of ply changes must precisely match thickness changes in the mold itself. This task is difficult in a production environment.\n\nDocument 5: “Both temperature and pressure are increased in the mold, reaching 180°C and a pressure of 6 bar during a 2-hour molding cycle.” The mold is cooled to 50°C, opened and the finished part is removed. The cycle time, including injection and mold cleaning, takes about 7 hours.\nThat automated preforming and RTM have succeeded in cutting seat cost vs. autoclaved prepreg is, perhaps, an obvious outcome, but the source of the 7% weight reduction? That was not so obvious. According to Rosenfeld, “This is due to very accurate plies. We optimized the part design for RTM, so there is not as much overlap in ply location and less material wasted. You also don’t have to factor in manual layup errors, so this reduces extra material as well.” He explains that the manual layup process has inaccuracies almost every time, but the robot is very predictable and less prone to errors.\nPart of what makes the robot so accurate is CAC’s “intelligent automation.” “We integrate a camera into the robotic arm,” says Thimon, “so that vision inspection is completed while preforming operations are ongoing. When you unroll material, it will check fiber orientation. It will also inspect during pick-and-place layup for fine positioning of the ply onto the tool/preform and for other defects in this part of the process, such as missing plies and incorrect fiber orientation.” IAI has worked with CAC to validate the inspection results. “It compares the visual images taken by the camera with the computer design file and shows any deviation,” says Rosenfeld. “CAC has developed a very good algorithm for this, and we have verified how well it works.”\nAlthough cycle time has already been reduced to one completed RTM seat per 8.5-hr shift, he believes this robotic inspection can eventually further reduce manual inspection times for even faster production. This automated RTM process also produces net-shaped parts with a high-quality finish on both sides, so the only post-molding operation is drilling a few holes. “We will also keep looking at newer resins that cure more quickly, like in automotive,” notes Rosenfeld.\nThe fabrication and installation of 700+ composite panels has a backstory of detailed design and careful quality assurance.\nThe old art behind this industry’s first fiber reinforcement is explained,with insights into new fiber science and future developments.\n\nDocument 6: Integrated fabrics, braids, preforms and pre-pregs are used in rapid fabrication of door inner, floor, seat back rest, roof, trunk and under the hood auto components, wind turbine blades and composite tanks (See Figure 3). Advanced manufacturing techniques such as injection overmolding, stampable preforms, locally stitched preforms, high-pressure resin transfer molding are some examples that reduce composites manufacturing costs and energy consumption and improve component performance and recyclability. Figure 4 illustrates a locally reinforced preform to provide directional properties. IACMI has partnership with the Long Island, N.Y.-based Composites Prototyping Center (CPC), for prototyping and fabrication.\nComposite recycling is of growing interest to the composites community. The next-generation technologies feature novel and increasingly complex combinations and formulations of fiber-reinforced composites, but these are difficult to recycle using current practices. Since recycled chopped carbon fiber costs 70-percent less to produce and uses up to 98-percent less energy to manufacture compared to virgin carbon fiber, recycling technologies are creating new markets from the estimated 29 million pounds of composite scrap sent to landfills annually. Advances in recycling technologies including pyrolysis, solvolysis, mechanical shredding and cement kiln incineration are enabling recycle, reuse, and remanufacture of products. IACMI has strategic partnerships in the recycling technologies with the American Composites Manufacturer’s Association (ACMA) and Composites Recycling Technology Center (CRTC), Port Angeles, Washington.\nAdditive technologies in composites manufacturing offer a high-rate, low-cost alternative to traditional tool-making approaches, and shows promise as an effective processing method for printing composite structures from reclaimed structural fibers. Additive approaches have the potential to significantly reduce composite tool-making lead times and increase the recovery and reuse of structural carbon fibers.\nAdvanced thermoplastic resins into current production processes: Thermoplastics have shorter cycle times and are more suitable for recycling. Increasing the use of thermoplastics for requires a variety of activities, including developing of novel in situ polymerization methods to improve thermoplastic fatigue performance, and establishing design-for-recyclability methods.\nDesign, Prototyping, and Validation (DPV) are integral steps to turning conceptual designs into high-performance components and verifying that these components meet their intended product requirements.\n\nDocument 7: Short description of the technology\nRTM (resin transfer molding) – molding technology via impregnating preforms (blanks made of fibers) with resin under pressure. The RTM process is suitable for medium and big series production. The method consists of impregnating dry fibers (first cut and placed into the mold) with thermoset resin under pressure. RTM parts have accurate surface and high mechanical properties. This technology allows us to produce highly loaded parts with strict tolerances (for example, airplane engine parts).\nAdvantages and restrictions of the technology\nRTM technology requires the use of two-sided molds (punch and matrix). The high cost of mold production, together with a medium-level production rate, makes this technology expensive for part production. Nevertheless, this method is widely used in some industries because of its advantages:\n– The ability to produce complex, integrated parts with inserts, with sandwich structure (foam core) helps to shorten assembly time;\n– High accuracy (low tolerances) and almost no post-molding processing;\n– The ability to produce parts with a high thickness and complex shape, which is usually impossible with other methods;\n– The high mechanical properties and wear-resistance (lifetime) of produced parts, and low-porous surface;\n– Easily painted surface (up to Class A);\n– The quality is reproducible in big series manufacturing.\nDepending on the customer’s needs, several types of reinforcing materials can be used: various fabrics and mats made of glass, carbon, organic or basalt fibers. Polyester or epoxy resins with low viscosity are usually used as a matrix material.\nRTM parts have smooth, accurate surfaces on all sides. This method offers wide design possibilities with a properly designed mold and careful preform preparation. The produced parts can have a complex profile, with different types of bosses, waves, different thickness and so on. The possibilities and restrictions of part design with RTM technology are described in detail in the table below.\nTable. Design of RTM parts\n|Thickness accuracy, mm|\n|Minimum inside radius, mm|\n|Minimum thickness, mm|\n|Maximum thickness, mm|\nWe produce polymer composite parts with high requirements for strength and accuracy using the RTM method.\nFor example, for certain clients we have made prototypes and set up mass production of glass fiber-reinforced exterior bus parts made by RTM.\n\nDocument 8: This process is generally performed at both elevated pressure and elevated temperature. The use of elevated pressure facilitates a high fibre volume fraction and low void content for maximum structural efficiency.\nResin transfer moulding (RTM)\nA process using a two-sided mould set that forms both surfaces of the panel. The lower side is a rigid mould. The upper side can be a rigid or flexible mould. Flexible moulds can be made from composite materials, silicone or extruded polymer films such as nylon. The two sides fit together to produce a mold cavity. The distinguishing feature of resin transfer moulding is that the reinforcement materials are placed into this cavity and the mould set is closed prior to the introduction of matrix material. Resin transfer moulding includes numerous varieties which differ in the mechanics of how the resin is introduced to the reinforcement in the mould cavity.\nOther types of moulding include press moulding, transfer moulding, pultrusion moulding, filament winding, casting, centrifugal casting and continuous casting. There are also forming capabilities including CNC filament winding, vacuum infusion, wet lay-up, compression moulding, and thermoplastic moulding.\nLow-temperature-cure epoxy tooling prepregs, such as HX50 and HX70 from Amber Composites or LTM series from Advanced Composite Group, have now become benchmark products in aerospace, automotive, marine, industrial and motorsport applications. With their reliability long-proven, steady improvement has resulted in materials that are easy to handle and apply, provide Class-A surface finish, and offer surprising longevity of tool life. Some systems now enable 200°C end use temperatures, and recent advancements in materials have enabled composite tools to be compatible with an ever wider variety of processing methods.\nIllsey points to the example of F1 car builders and America's Cup boat builders.\n“F1 teams need a large number of small, complicated parts. Yacht builders may need a single 30 m long part. Both require extremely precise dimensions. You can find both using a similar HX tooling system with great results.”\nToday's high-performance contemporary yacht moulds are frequently made using tooling prepreg, as are the moulds in military and unmanned aerospace applications. Even in the commercial aerospace industry, after a long development cycle, composites are now widely used. Entire wing sections on the new Airbus A350, for instance, will be made from carbon fibre, and a considerable proportion of the tooling will utilise composite prepreg.\n\nDocument 9: The increasing use of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites in aviation and automotive industries has led to the adoption of automated production methods such as pultrusion or resin transfer moulding (RTM) for cost reduction in the production lightweight structures. These processes however, offer limited freedom to locally reinforce structures. This paper describes an approach to utilise a basic geometry for several similar parts and add local reinforcement patches only in regions of load introduction or high local stress. The approach offers the benefit of being able to combine automated production methods with unprecedented design freedom. The specific bearing performance for three different local reinforcement using (1) add-on CFRP patches, (2) surface mounted steel foils and (3) steel foil interleaving in replacement of 90° plies with foils of the same thickness as the CFRP plies (0.125 mm) is compared by double lap bearing tests. The bearing strength improves with the addition of patches, for surface mounted steel foils, more so as CFRP co-cured patches, and most as an interleaved configuration. Quasi ductile failure of the bearing joints was maintained due to additional plasticity of the steel foils, producing a joint that fails safely while enhancing the bearing strength. When examining the hybrid laminates, all samples buckled and failed in bearing compression/shear. Brooming was evident on the compressive side of the hole where the bolt indented the laminate. Indentation led to shear kink bands along the washer supported region and appear as large compression/shear damage above the washer confined region of the laminate. When normalised by weight, the three approaches show similar bearing performance. However, each approach has specific advantages with regards to processing, electrolytic potential, or absolute bearing strength, depending on the design of the load introduction.\n\nDocument 10: The question was, ‘What type of equipment and process steps were needed between cutting and RTM?’ “We looked at the cutting system and what type of communication would be required,” explains Marc-Ruddy Thimon, director of sales for CAC. “The next steps would include automated layup, using a pick-and-place robot and application of plies onto a preforming tool, followed by debulking/compaction where heat and vacuum are applied.”\nIn the solution developed by IAI and TME, a cutting table and single robot are synchronized via a central control unit. Rosenfeld explains: “The robot picks up plies in a predefined sequence per the design: Two glass fabric plies (face-up and face-down) and two carbon fabric plies (face-up and face-down), which achieve a symmetric laminate.” The synchronized system changes the rolls of fabric automatically as needed to keep the production line running. The system is set to cut a number of “boards,” which contain cuts (pieces) from the same roll, according to the specific layup stage. The number of cuts within a “board” varies between four and 30, depending on the layup configuration as defined per each layup stage. The cuts are nested to achieve maximum material usage and minimize waste. The fabric is also coated with thermoplastic powder to aid preform consolidation.\nThe robot then places the cut plies onto the heated mold to achieve a 3D shape. However, there is an important bit of innovation here: “We have developed specialized end-effectors that operate like hands,” explains Thimon, “allowing 2D materials to be folded and formed into complex-shaped areas like corners.” As part of the preform building process, periodic vacuum debulks are performed with a reusable membrane. Debulk of prepregs with the same membrane was an established step in the prepreg seat process. IAI found that it also worked well to consolidate the thermoplastic-coated fabrics into a high-quality preform.\nThe single work cell robot, with end effector now changed to trimming head, is then used to trim the preform to achieve a net-shape part. The trimmed preform is manually transferred to the bottom mold in the RTM press. “We apply vacuum and begin resin injection, using the Isojet injection machine,” says Rosenfeld.\n\nDocument 11: \"Applying the chopped material robotically right to the shape not only cuts the amount of scrap, but it's cheaper scrap.\" Since the preform is built right on the tool, the process eliminates the step required to transfer the finished preform from a manufacturing station to the part mold, so there is no risk of damage and no extra space is required to store preforms or preform tools.\nRIMFIRE + ZIP RTM\nIn production, RIMFIRE can be used with most available closed molding options, including standard resin transfer molding (RTM) and various methods of vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) and vacuum-assisted resin infusion molding (VARIM). Sea Ray currently uses ZIP RTM (zero injection pressure resin transfer molding) process, licensed from Plastech Thermoset Tectonics (Gunnislake, Plymouth, U.K.) and Plastech's North American partner JHM Technologies (Fenton, Mich.). ZIP RTM motivates resin flow with both vacuum and injection pressure, slightly favoring the vacuum, which results in less stress on the mold. This permits the use of less costly semi-rigid tooling. A multi-station inline system, ZIP RTM processes several lower molds simultaneously, but requires only two upper mold halves per line, keeping mold manufacturing costs to a minimum. (photos show construction of Sea Ray's 20-ft/6m 205 sport boat hull.)\nBefore production starts, technicians apply Chemlease (Chem-Trend, Howell, Mich.) or equivalent semipermanent release agents to upper and lower molds. Gel coat is applied to the lower mold and allowed to cure. Meanwhile, the specified fiberglass gun roving is loaded onto pallets behind the robot. Four rovings of continuous glass, typically 112- or 113-yield, are threaded through the end effector.\nIn a pre-loading station ahead of the RIMFIRE preforming cell, multiaxial glass fabric is laid into tight radii in the lower mold, if called for in the FEA, to prevent bridging of the preform spray over the angle. The mold is then latched onto a computer-controlled indexing device that rides on a floor-mounted rail, and is moved into the preform cell.\nAn operator starts the previously downloaded software program.\n\nDocument 12: The new Boeing 787 Dreamliner is composed of over 50% composites and some very large production tools are made of composite tooling prepreg.\nMore recently, companies are also able to consider developing very low cost composite tooling through the development of prepreg that can be processed without the need for autoclave pressure and without increasing resin volume. These are commonly known as out of autoclave (OOA) products. This technique is helpful when making large parts and when the integrity of the pattern/master cannot withstand the pressure of an autoclave.\nBenefits of composite tooling\nCompared with traditional metal tooling, composite tooling can provide a lower cost of production and easier handling and storage. For performance parts requiring accurate dimensions, composite tooling offers a CTE closer to the part CTE, helping the part maintain dimensional integrity during cure.\nCompared with a few years ago, composite tooling is more widely available, more user-friendly, and more efficient to process. Prepreg is now available with excellent drapeability enabling accurate reproduction of small radii corners, a wide range of tackiness, a wide range of curing temperatures, and a wide range of dimensions.\n“A great example application was the recent development of the ALMA telescopes to be placed in Chile”, says Illsley. “The telescope is comprised of a set of segments, each of which have to be identical and precise. In order to meet these exacting accuracy requirements, they used our HX50 tooling prepreg. And, to address the outlife challenges faced when working with such a large tool, we supplied the tooling prepreg in pre-cut squares.”\nAnother reason composite tooling is gaining popularity is the availability of a proven package solution. Customers can buy a complete set of materials including tooling paste or blocks, adhesive, release agent, primer, sealer, tooling prepreg and component prepreg — all from a single source and all proven to work together seamlessly. Axson Technologies is a full-service supplier that has seen rapid growth from its complete solution packages.\nAmber tooling prepreg\nMultipreg HX42: An epoxy resin system that can be pre-impregnated into high performance fibres such as carbon, and glass. It is an exceptional and very well-proven system in aerospace applications that exhibits a high end-use temperature and extended outlife.\n\nDocument 13: Description of the Related Art\nReinforced thermoplastic and thermoset materials have wide application in, for example, the aerospace, automotive, industrial/chemical, and sporting goods industries. Thermosetting resins are impregnated into the reinforcing material before curing, while the resinous materials are low in viscosity. Thermoset composites suffer from several disadvantages. Low molding pressures are used to prepare these composites to avoid damage to the fibers. These low pressures, however, make it difficult to suppress the formation of bubbles within the composite which can result in voids or defects in the matrix coating. Thus, most processing problems with thermoset composites are concerned with removing entrained air or volatiles so that a void-free matrix is produced. Thermoset composites made by the prepreg method require lengthy cure times with alternating pressures to control the flow of the resin as it thickens to prevent bubbles in the matrix. While current fabrication of large structures utilize robotic placement of the thermoset composite material to increase production rate, its overall production rate for the component is limited by the lengthy cure in the autoclave process step and related operations to prepare the material for that process step. Some high volume processes, such as resin infusion avoid the prepreg step but still require special equipment and materials along with constant monitoring of the process over the length of the cure time (e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,132,755, and 5,721,034). Although thermoset resins have enjoyed success as in lower volume composites applications, the difficulties in processing these resins has limited their use in larger volume applications.\nThermoplastic compositions, in contrast, are more difficult to impregnate into the reinforcing material because of comparatively higher viscosities. On the other hand, thermoplastic compositions offer a number of benefits over thermosetting compositions. For example, thermoplastic prepregs can be more rapidly fabricated into articles. Another advantage is that thermoplastic articles formed from such prepregs may be recycled. In addition, damage resistant composites with excellent performance in hot humid environments may be achieved by the proper selection of the thermoplastic matrix. Thermoplastic resins are long chain polymers of high molecular weight. These polymers are highly viscous when melted and are often non-Newtonian in their flow behavior.\n\nDocument 14: Another data point regarding the transition toward what may be considered non-traditional materials for automotive applications (unless, of course, said applications are for cars with (1) price tags that are generally at or above six figures or (2) use on Formula One circuits) comes from Dow Automotive Systems, which has recently opened two labs with a focus on developing carbon fiber composites.\nOne was opened in Freienbach, Switzerland. This is a 2,153-square-foot facility that features a large, high-pressure resin transfer molding machine (RTM) that’s used for prototype production. And because composite components are typically mechanically fastened and then adhesively bonded (after all, you’re not going to weld them), it features an Adhesives Training Center, as well.\nThe other lab was opened in Midland, Michigan, where The Dow Chemical Co. is based. Consequently, this 5,005-square-foot operation is close to corporate R&D, including analytical science, its Materials Engineering Center, and an array of polymer chemistry and processing expertise. Which is undoubtedly helpful. A focus at this lab is on the technologies associated with direct long-fiber processing, prepreg, performing, compression molding, and laminating.\nAs vehicle manufacturers begin to face the challenges of regulations that require increased fuel efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions, not only is it going to be alternative powertrains, but significantly lighter vehicles, which composites certainly can help realize.\nWhile they are pricey at present, let’s face it: hybrid systems and full-electric vehicles aren’t cheap, either.\n\nQuestion: What are the main advantages of using automated RTM (Resin Transfer Molding) over traditional prepreg manufacturing for aircraft seat structures?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Automated RTM offers several key advantages over traditional prepreg manufacturing for aircraft seat structures. These include cost reduction by 30%, weight savings of 7%, improved part accuracy, and enhanced production efficiency. By leveraging intelligent automation and robotic inspection, automated RTM minimizes manual errors and ensures consistent quality, which is crucial for aerospace applications. Additionally, the process enables faster production cycles and reduces the need for manual labor, leading to increased efficiency. These advantages make automated RTM a more attractive option for the production of aircraft seat structures, offering both economic benefits and improved performance."}

Phallic Symbols Ward off Evil\nIf you travel across Bhutan you will see a lot of phallic symbols either painted in different colors and shapes or a wooden carved phallus hanging by the roof. These are not there for aesthetic purposes but for a belief which states that it will ward off evil spirits and malicious intents away. Bhutanese do not take it as an offense but rather they will feel blessed by these images.\n5. Only Carbon Negative Country in the World\nBhutan is the only country in the world to absorb more carbon dioxide than it produces. According to statistics Bhutan only produces about 1.5million tons of carbon dioxide a year and Bhutan has 72% of forest coverage. Thanks to that, Bhutan absorbs 6 million tons of carbon every year which makes the small Himalayan nation the world’s only carbon sink. The government’s effort to conserve its environment has always been a top priority. It has been also mandated that at least 60% of the country should have forest coverage at all times to come.\n6. No Slaughter Houses\nThough Bhutanese people consume meat, the country has no slaughterhouse of its own. The meats are imported from its neighboring countries like India and Nepal.

US dollars are widely accepted. Bhutanese currency is only needed for personal expenses and small souvenir items. For larger expenses, travelers can use US Dollars and other foreign currency. Most ATMs in Bhutan (mostly concentrated in Thimphu and Paro) are compatible with international credit cards, such as Visa, Mastercard and Maestro. However, as the service is not overly reliable, it’s good practice to have a supply of ngultrum or US dollars on hand.\nTap water is unsafe in Bhutan. Stick to bottled water or the purified water provided by your hotel.\nTipping is not obligatory. Hotels and restaurant bills include service charges of 20 percent. There’s no need to add anything further to these bills, but do feel free to tip your guides, drivers and other crew members accompanying you throughout your trip.\nBhutan is a modest country that adheres to its Buddhist principles. Dress conservatively, and be respectful of the local culture and customs. Never touch someone on the head, and don't use your feet to point at anything.

From the plain areas of the southern foothills to the mountainous Himalayas of alpine zones and to beautiful curves of central valleys, We have it all.\nBhutan lies in 27°30′N90°30′E and inhabits numerous mountain peaks. The nation is home to the highest unclimbed mountain of the world Jomolhari, which lies at a height of 7326m. The mountain peaks in the country are a stunning display of natural embellishment.

So there I stood in the cool light of dawn, staring up at the massive image of Rimpoche seated upon his lotus throne. Bhutanese people had come from all over, many walking for days to see the Thondrol. It remains up for only a few hours, on this one day a year, as the monks do not let the 300 year old work of devotional art be touched by direct rays of the sun, least it fade.\nI then made my way to the booth of Mangala Paper, who make the paper we import, and introduced myself to Kezang Udon. Her Eco Friendly hand made paper was doing a brisk business, with many western tourists checking out the beautiful sheets, as well as handsome photo albums and journals crafted from Bhutan paper. I told Kezang how proud I was to be part of the introduction of Bhutan paper to the United States and she graced me with the warm smile that is so typical of the Bhutanese people.\nI promised to stop by her factory on my way back from my journey to the remote central valley, and began an arduous day and a half drive on the only paved road in the country.\nI traveled over passes towering above the clouds, through dense forests punctuated by flaming red rhodendrums. I visited the cave where Guru Rimpoche first meditated when he arrived in Bhutan from Tibet. A temple has been built around the cave and a huge cypress tree stands beside it, supposedly having sprung up from Rimpoche's walking stick. I touched the tree with deep respect for the man who is believed to be the second incarnation of Buddha.\nOn the return journey it began to snow. We were heading for a monastery at the top of a pass, and arrived to the sound of deep guttural chanting of monks, accompanied by the plaintive cry of conch shell horns and thudding bass of drums. A healing ceremony for the Lama (Teacher) was in progress and we were allowed to observe.\nThe interior of the monastery was a treasure trove of wall paintings depicting various spiritual heroes battling demons. Bhutan is a Tantric Buddhist nation, thus visualizations of inner states of mind are constantly on view, serving as signposts on the path towards enlightenment.\n\nDocument 2: Bhutan’s Tsechu Festivals\nIf you have heard about Bhutan, surely you have heard about Bhutan’s Tsechu festivals. Tsechu, which literally means ‘day ten’ in Dzongkha language, are annual celebrations held in the Dzong fortresses and prominent temples on the 10th day of Tibetan-Bhutanese calendar.\nCham dances are the major attractions of Tsechu and are performed by monks and common people who wear traditional costumes and masks and portray the incidents from the life of 8th century Buddhist teacher Padmasambhava-who is also known as Guru Rinpoche in Bhutan and Tibet. The tradition of the tsechu goes back to 8th or 9th century when Guru visited Bhutan to cure the ailing king and performed rituals and rites involving series of dances.\nThe other attraction of Tsechu is thondrel display. A thongdrel is a giant silk embroidered painting of Guru Rinpoche, Zhabdrung and Buddha. Thongdrel display ceremony usually takes place on the last day, before dawn and stays out for public audiences for two or three hours and then it’s folded back and concealed inside for a year until the next Tsechu. As the thongdrel is raised, people cheer, hum the Buddhist prayers and offer Khada scarves to the sacred painting. People feel blessed by joining the thongdrel display and expect good fortune for the year.\nBhutanese people join the celebration with their friends and families and witness religious mask dances, receive blessings and socialize. Everyone wears national costume made up of finest hand oven textile. You may also request your guide to arrange a dress for you so that you don’t look odd in the crowd.\nBesides formal mask dances, there will be folklore singing and dancing by locals and people enjoy outdoor picnic with their friends and families. It’s okay to crash into a group, if you wish. People are friendly and welcoming. Share your lunch with them and try theirs! For sure, you will love their home-cooked meals, while you will find them curious about the food you bring from your hotel or restaurant.\nIt’s okay to crash into the picnic of one of the groups, if you wish.

To make a call from Croatia, the dialing code is 00975. The prefix for international calls from Bhutan is 00.\nWhat is the history of Bhutan and Croatia?\nThe history of Bhutan and Croatia is intertwined. Bhutan and Croatia share a common ancestry, with both countries tracing their roots back to the ancient state of Magadha. Bhutan and Croatia also share a common culture, with both countries being Buddhist and Catholic.\nWhat are the similarities and differences of the two countries?\nThere are many similarities and differences between Canada and the United States. Some of the similarities include that both countries are democracies, have a capitalist economy, and are bilingual. Some of the differences include the size of the two countries, the climate, and the healthcare system.\nHow have the two countries interacted with one another over the years?\nThe United States and Canada have interacted with one another over the years through economic, social, and political means. The two countries share the world’s longest undefended border, and have a close relationship economically. The two countries are also politically close, with each country being a member of the United Nations, NATO, and the G7.\nWhat are the prospects for the future relationship between Bhutan and Croatia?\nThe prospects for the future relationship between Bhutan and Croatia are good.\n\nDocument 4: Many people have never heard of Bhutan, the country that values Gross National Happiness over Gross National Product! Bhutan is a landlocked little country roughly the size of Switzerland. It is bounded on the north and northwest by Tibet, with India touching its remaining borders and Nepal a bit to the west. Virtually the entire country is mountainous, peaking at 24,777ft. North to south it features three geographic regions; the high Himalaya of the north, the hills and valleys of the centre, and the foothills and plains of the south.\nFor centuries Bhutan has remained isolated from the rest of the world. Since its doors were opened in 1974, visitors have been mesmerized by the beautiful and pristine country and the hospitable and charming people. The best time to visit is October and November and during major festivals. The climate is best in autumn, from late September to late November, when skies are clear and the high mountain peaks are visible. It’s not unusual to experience rain no matter what the season, but I recommend avoiding the monsoon season, June-August, when buckets of rain come down.\nBuddhism was probably introduced in Bhutan around the 2nd century although, traditionally, its introduction is credited to the first visit of Guru Rinpoche in the 8th century. Before that the people followed a shamanistic tradition called Bon that still exists today, merged with their Buddhist traditions.\nGuru Rinpoche is the most important figure in Bhutan’s history, regarded as the second Buddha. His miraculous powers included the ability to subdue demons and evil spirits, and he preserved his teachings and wisdom by concealing them in the form of terma (hidden treasures) to be found later by enlightened treasure discoverers known as tertons. One of the best known of these tertons was Pema Lingpa; the texts and artifacts he found, the religious dances he composed, and the art he produced, are vital parts of Bhutan’s living heritage.\nThe largest and most colorful festivals (tsechus) take place at Bhutan’s dzongs and monasteries once a year, in honor of Guru Rinpoche. Tsechus consist of up to five days of spectacular pageantry, masked dances and religious allegorical plays. These festivals play a large part in the Buddhist teachings and are also social gatherings.\n\nDocument 5: The statute satisfies an antiquated prediction going back to the eighth century that was found by Terton Pema Lingpa (Religious Treasure Discoverer) and is said to radiate an emanation of harmony and joy to the whole world.\n4. Punakha Dzong\nPunakha Dzong is arguably the best dzong among many which brands it one of the best places to visit in Bhutan. In the southernmost yard of Punakha Dzong is where two holy bodies are preserved for more than four centuries. In Punakha Dzong, there is a conserved body of a Buddhist Lama Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal, Who were Tibetan Buddhist lama and the unifier of Bhutan as a nation-state. Among many of the fortress built by Zhabdrung, the Punakha Dzong is the most significant one. In Bhutan, Zhabdrung is widely worshipped like a god. This Dzong was the second to be worked in Bhutan and it filled in as the capital and seat of government until the mid-1950s. The majority of Bhutan's lords have been delegated here. The dzong is as yet the winter living arrangement of the Dratshang (official priest body).\n5. The Royal Manas National Park\nThe Royal Manas National Park is situated in south-central Bhutan. This National Park has wide climate variations. In excess of 365 types of winged animals have been formally recorded in Royal Manas National Park with an extra 200 accepted to be in living arrangement. November through February, the Royal Manas National Park climate stays charming. The climatic varieties are very normal albeit negligible precipitation is seen amid the winter season. Around 5,000 mm precipitation is seen each year amid May through September. Because of these unique characteristics, The Royal Manas National Park is listed as one of the best places to visit in Bhutan.\n6. Rinpung Dzong (Paro Dzong)\nRinpung Dzong is located approximately three kilometers from Paro city. Rinpung Dzong is an example of one of the finest Bhutanese architecture. Like most dzongs in Bhutan, it houses priests and is an imperative authoritative focus in the city.\n\nDocument 6: I came across a very interesting article on the net about the government and the people of Bhutan. I mentioned this in one of my blogs when researching OHP back in January.\nOccupational Health Psychology (OHP), a relatively new discipline, emerged from two distinct applied psychology disciplines, health psychology and industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology, as well as occupational health. According to Wikipedia, “[OHP] concerns the application of psychology to improving the quality of work life, and to protecting and promoting the safety, health and well-being of workers. OHP is concerned with psychosocial factors in the work environment and the development, maintenance, and promotion of employee health and that of their families. OHP includes a number of other disciplines, occupational sociology, industrial engineering, economics, preventive medicine, public health and others.\nBack to Bhutan. This country keeps a happiness meter on its people and that’s how they measure how well things are going in that country. How wonderful! How simple!\nFrom the excerpt:\n“The tiny Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan measures its economic development and growth not with the conventional measure of GDP, but with the holistic, multidimensional measure of Gross National Happiness (GNH), which is measured based on economic self-reliance, environmental preservation, cultural promotion and good governance. The government’s goal is to balance economic progress with the spiritual and emotional well-being of the people.”\n“Bhutan is known for shunning conventional development and going its own way. The first foreign tourists didn’t come to the country until 1974, and the government allows only 9,000 to enter per year, each of whom pay fees of $200 per day. Television and the Internet arrived only in 1999. Most recently, the Government of Bhutan made it illegal to sell tobacco or smoke in public, becoming the first officially non-smoking nation.”\n“This statistic is compiled from responses to the survey question: “Taking all things together, would you say you are: very happy, quite happy, not very happy, or not at all happy?” The “Happiness (net)” statistic was obtained via the following formula: the percentage of people who rated themselves as either “quite happy” or “very happy” minus the percentage of people who rated themselves as either “not very happy” or “not at all happy”.” Continue Reading →\n\nDocument 7: Bhutan was known as Lho-Mon Khazhi (Southern Mon of Four Approaches) to the Tibetans who resided to the north of Bhutan. The ‘mon’ probably meant darkness. The Lhomon means Dark South or Sothern Land of Darkness. And Khazhi means ‘four approaches’. Four approaches/passes are Pasakha to the south, Dalingkha to the west, Tagtserkha to the north and Dungsamkha to the east.\nDungsam comprised of present district of Samdrup Jongkhar and Pemagatshel. Now Dungsam is predominantly associate with the Pemagatshel after merger of Dungsam Nganglam and Decehenling to Pema Gatshel district. As of now Dewathang.(it is place where Duar war was fought between British and Trongsa Penlop, father of the First King of Bhutan. The place was known as Dewangiri) and few other small places in Sumdrup Jongkhar is known as Dungsam\nSome said that Dungsam means ‘three conch shaped hills’ named after three hills in Pema Gatshel. Some said that there was a lake called Dungtsho Karma Thang (Conch Lake on Plain of Stars) on the hill above Khar community. Later, lake dried up and people started settling there. Those people were known as Dungtshopa. Dungsampa could be corrupted word of Dungtshopa. Dungsam also was known as Dungsam Dhosum. It was probably one of the eight spokes of wheel of East (Sharchog khorlo Tsibgay). The term Dungsam could also mean three villages/communities. It is possible that dhosum was added later for easy understanding by official for purpose of tax collection. Although I am unable to find any concrete text at this point, Dungsam could also meant three dung (bone). Dung or bone refers to important secular family of which ruled central Bhutan which later spread. Dungsam was said to have four Choje namely Chungkhar, Bangtsho, Dungkhar and Shalikhar.\n\nDocument 8: Top 10 Best Places to Visit in Bhutan\nBhutan - OfficiallyTheKingdom of Bhutan or (འབྲུག་རྒྱལ་ཁབ་, Druk Gyal Khap ) is one of the exciting and adventurous tourist destinations in South Asia and is also known as the land of the Thunder Dragon.

For smokers though, they are allowed to import a certain number of cigarettes every month after declaring and paying taxes. If you are a smoker and planning on traveling to Bhutan, you might want to know how you can bring cigarettes to Bhutan.\n4. Phallic Symbols Ward off Evil\nIf you travel across Bhutan you will see a lot of phallic symbols either painted in different colors and shapes or a wooden carved phallus hanging by the roof. These are not there for aesthetic purposes but for a belief which states that it will ward off evil spirits and malicious intents away. Bhutanese do not take it as an offense but rather they will feel blessed by these images.\n5. Only Carbon Negative Country in the World\nBhutan is the only country in the world to absorb more carbon dioxide than it produces. According to statistics Bhutan only produces about 1.5million tons of carbon dioxide a year and Bhutan has 72% of forest coverage. Thanks to that, Bhutan absorbs 6 million tons of carbon every year which makes the small Himalayan nation the world’s only carbon sink. The government’s effort to conserve its environment has always been a top priority. It has been also mandated that at least 60% of the country should have forest coverage at all times to come.\n6. No Slaughter Houses\nThough Bhutanese people consume meat, the country has no slaughterhouse of its own. The meats are imported from its neighboring countries like India and Nepal. Due to its Buddhist beliefs, almost 40% of its population is vegetarian and killing is strongly prohibited in the country. Unless the animals die of natural causes, its owners are not allowed to kill them. Also, the sale of meat during holy months and auspicious days are banned. Don’t be surprised if you see cows wandering on the streets very happily.\n7. Bhutan does not have an Independence Day\nThough small in size and surrounded by giants like India to the south and China to the north, Bhutan was never colonized. Even during the time of British Empire, Bhutan remained a sovereign nation and it may be the only country in the world to never have been colonized.\n\nDocument 10: Most of the country relies on subsistence farming.\nThe Bhutanese inherit some truly unique customs that have their origin in the mythological legends and folktales of the country. For example, visitors will likely see giant phalluses painted outside the homes of otherwise reserved Bhutanese people. Theses images represent the Divine Madman, a figure believed to ward off evil spirits. Don’t be alarmed when you see this on a person's home.\nIt’s compulsory for all Bhutanese citizens to adhere to a national dress code when in public. Men wear robes called gho, while women wear brightly colored kira with ornate brooches and wraparound skirts.\nVisitors should take advantage of the opportunities to witness cultural experiences, such as dance, music, archery (a very popular sport) and religious ceremonies.\nGood to Know\nWhen traveling in Bhutan, keep some of the following in mind:\nThe official currency is the ngultrum (BTN), which is pegged to the Indian rupee (INR). US dollars are widely accepted. Bhutanese currency is only needed for personal expenses and small souvenir items. For larger expenses, travelers can use US Dollars and other foreign currency. Most ATMs in Bhutan (mostly concentrated in Thimphu and Paro) are compatible with international credit cards, such as Visa, Mastercard and Maestro. However, as the service is not overly reliable, it’s good practice to have a supply of ngultrum or US dollars on hand.\nTap water is unsafe in Bhutan. Stick to bottled water or the purified water provided by your hotel.\nTipping is not obligatory. Hotels and restaurant bills include service charges of 20 percent. There’s no need to add anything further to these bills, but do feel free to tip your guides, drivers and other crew members accompanying you throughout your trip.\nBhutan is a modest country that adheres to its Buddhist principles. Dress conservatively, and be respectful of the local culture and customs. Never touch someone on the head, and don't use your feet to point at anything. A formal greeting is to bow with outstretched, open hands (palms up). Always show the utmost respect in temples and holy places.\nThe standard voltage is 230 volt, and the frequency is 50 hertz.\n\nDocument 11: I do receive the question, why Bhutan? Well, it is a country that limits tourism, builds within parameters of sustainable development and preserves cultural values. The government protects the environment and the spiritual values of the predominant Buddhist population. The days flow with a state of harmony and presence. Bhutan has synergy- between government and the people, between the religious body and the government, between the communities. Bhutanese people honor nature, light incense, pray, support ritual, and family values. Joy is apparent so the name Gross Nation of Happiness fits this small jewel in the Himalayas.\nThere are many places to visit and many in Asia but Bhutan is unique and the country follows the motif of “happiness.” What can be better than that?\nJoin us for a trip of a lifetime!\nCathy Shill, owner of The Hole Hiking Experience, has partnered with an established company in Bhutan to share this spectacular country. She is promoting two fall trips and details are listed below. Private trips or personalized itineraries for your group are also available.\n2012 participant joining again in 2013!\n“My wife and I had the opportunity to spend 14 glorious days with Cathy and Kinlay in Bhutan. What made the trip incredible was not only a terrific balance of both adventure and culture, but also Kinlay’s ability to bring specific requests to fruition. Bhutan is a very unique country with wonderful people. They are on the cusp which leads to a sense of excitement at every corner. Cathy and Kinlay covered all corners, plus, so much so that I will be going back to Bhutan for another adventure with them in the fall.”\nChomolhari Mountain Trek\nSeptember 30-October 13, 2013\nTrek deep within the Himalayas to the sacred peaks. Hike along cascading water through a rich, diverse forest to the Chomolhari base camp. Experience the high country which is home to yak herders, blue sheep, and unparalleled beauty. It’s the perfect mix for a trekker: three acclimating date hikes, cultural exploration, and eight days of camping.

People often wonder where is Bhutan, despite a mere 38394 sq. km Bhutan has one of the most diverse geographies in South East Asia. From the plain areas of the southern foothills to the mountainous Himalayas of alpine zones and to beautiful curves of central valleys, We have it all.\nBhutan lies in 27°30′N90°30′E and inhabits numerous mountain peaks. The nation is home to the highest unclimbed mountain of the world Jomolhari, which lies at a height of 7326m. The mountain peaks in the country are a stunning display of natural embellishment. Some of the other mountain peaks include Jichudrakey and Jowodurshing. The country also houses glacial lakes in abundance with an estimate of 2674 glacial lakes and 59 natural mountain lakes.\nThe North Star\nNavigating through the dense mountainous region of the country would have been arduous if not for the various passes. These passes used to be like a north star for the inhabitants of the country in the olden days. Today, it’s still used through the modern platform of transportation and is a visual spectacle when one traverses through the mountainous region. The passes in Bhutan are as follows:\nChele La between the Haa valley and Paro valley (3,810 m /13000 ft), It is the highest pass crossed by Bhutanese highway.\nDochu La between Thimphu and Punakha (3,116 m/10,223 ft),\nPele La at (3,390 m/ 1122 ft)\nYotong La, (3450m/ 11318 ft)\nThrumshing La (3752m/ 12309 ft)\nIs Bhutan a Cold Place?\nDue to the difference in elevation, the climate varies in different regions of the country. The southern foothills being nearer to the Indian ocean and bay of Bengal holds a humid weather with annual monsoon season. The temperature gets loser as elevation increases to the inner Himalaya. The temperature in the southern region usually ranges from 150C in winter to 300C in winter. It makes make the region much ideal for visit during the winter season.\n\nDocument 13: Where is Bhutan?\nLocated in Southern Asia, Bhutan has a 1,136.00 km border with China (477 km) and India (659 km). Bhutan and China are currently still involved in negotiations to establish a common boundary alignment.\nThe capital of Bhutan is Thimphu, located in Thimphu District near the Raidak River. The city became the capital following a royal declaration of 1961 and remains the only city in the country. Thimphu’s population is slightly more than 100,000 and a population density of slightly less than 7,8500 people per square mile. The city’s population density is highest in the country and continues to witness an increase in the number of people. This city relies majorly on the historical buildings for tourist attractions although the government is careful not to prioritize the sector to an extent that it overshadows the other economic development programs. Thimphu has a subtropical highland climate that is heavily influenced by monsoon winds. June to December constitute the wettest months while the other months are relatively dry.Read more on Bhutan's Capital\nBhutan is an Asian country covering 38,394.00 km2. This makes it the 62nd smallest country in the world and slightly larger than Maryland; about one-half the size of Indiana. Its geographic coordinates are 27 30 N, 90 30 E and Thimphu is the capital city.\nThe countryis named after Bhotia, the ethnic Tibetans who migrated from Tibet to Bhutan.\nIts ISO code is BT.\nBhutan has a mean elevation of 2,220 m above sea level.\nIt has a climate that is mostly tropical in the southern plains, and less moderate in the central valley and Himilaya regions. Its terrain is mostly mountainous with some areas of savanna.\nBhutan has a population of 750,125 making it the 164th largest in the world.\nSharchhopka, Dzongkha, Lhotshamkha are all widely spoken. The major ethnicities are Ngalop, ethnic Nepalese and indigenous or migrant tribes. The population is mostly Lamaistic Buddhist.\nSince 1971, the official and most spoken language of Bhutan has been Dzongkha.\n\nQuestion: What is the Thondrol and why is it significant in Bhutan?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "The Thondrol is a significant religious artifact in Bhutan, featuring an embroidered painting of Guru Rimpoche, Zhabdrung, and Buddha. It is displayed for only a few hours during Tsechu festivals, and its viewing is believed to bring liberation and blessings. The Thondrol's cultural and spiritual importance is underscored by its protection from direct sunlight to prevent fading. This practice reflects the deep spiritual and cultural significance of the Thondrol in Bhutanese Buddhism."}
{"id": 23, "question": "What percentage of new non-residential buildings were considered 'green construction' in 2010 compared to 2005?", "passages": [{"passage": "Agency analysts told InsideClimate News that Architecture 2030's report downplays factors that have nothing to do with making buildings greener like the huge slowdown in construction from the recession that means fewer buildings have been, and will get, built.\nFor the most part, though, EIA officials agree with the bottom line of Mazria's report that green improvements are saving energy. \"Over the years, our projections for buildings' energy consumption have decreased, and a lot of that is due to increases in efficiency,\" Erin Boedecker, the lead building analyst at EIA, said.\nThe Rise of the Green Building\nSince 2005, the federal government and most states have adopted various building codes and efficiency tax incentives that have helped spur a green-building boom.\nMost notably, a mandate under the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act requires all federal buildings to reduce energy use by 30 percent in 2015 compared to 2003 levels. In 2010, California passed the nation's first mandatory statewide green building code, which took effect last year. Meanwhile, more than half of all states have adopted the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code, a standard created by the International Code Council, a U.S.-based nonprofit, which requires buildings to meet efficiency standards for heating units and air conditioners, water heaters and lighting.\nAs a result of these and other policies, efficiency fixes such as energy-efficient lighting and appliances, insulation, tightly sealed windows and rooftop solar panels, have become common in new and renovated buildings. Green construction jumped from two percent of new non-residential buildings in 2005 to nearly 30 percent in 2010, according to the latest figures from McGraw Hill Construction, a publisher of construction information.\nMarket forces are also at play. While it can be expensive to make buildings energy efficient, the return on investment, mainly from avoided electricity or heating costs, is nearly 10 percent higher than from conventional buildings, according to McGraw Hill.\nGreen builders can also receive thousands in rebates and tax incentives from state governments, allowing them to recoup upfront costs even faster. An additional lure: A building with green features generally has higher value, occupancy rates and can fetch higher rents than it would otherwise.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:678d1149-ef2b-4033-a930-106a2abde041>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "These numbers are getting the attention of developers and driving the growth of eco-construction. Nationally, about 2% of today's new, nonresidential construction is considered green, estimates the MHC study. From last year's $3.3 billion, green office and retail construction is expected to surge by up to 10% a year, to $20 billion, by 2010.\nCosts Backing Down\nGiven New York's love affair with tall towers and the unmatched scale of the city's real estate market, it's no surprise that Manhattan is emerging as the epicenter of green high-rise construction. Bank of America's tower will be the greenest of a surge of eco-friendly office buildings sprouting up in midtown and near Wall Street.\nFirst to open was 7 World Trade Center, the start of new construction at Ground Zero. Next was Foster + Partners' stunning addition to Hearst's headquarters in midtown. And nearing completion just a few blocks west of Bank of America Tower on 42nd Street is Renzo Piano's New York Times Building.\nThe flurry of eco-construction reflects builders' growing confidence that the extra costs of building green are a good investment. The up front costs of building green are still higher than using conventional materials, but that premium is shrinking. Just a few years ago, green construction could cost 10% or more than standard construction.\nToday that margin has fallen into the range of single digits. As the market for green materials and design expertise has grown and matured, \"the supply of materials and services is going up and the price is coming down,\" says Taryn Holowka, communications manager at the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).\nWaterless Water Closets\nTo be sure, green projects can still throw up costly delays or surprising snafus. Until recently, for example, New York-area carting companies charged extra to sort and recycle construction debris.\nBut as haulers have come to recognize the market value of the refuse, they've lowered their prices and become more cooperative. At the Bank of America site, explains Cook+Fox's Lisa Storer, carting companies presorted scrap steel, concrete, and other debris on site for removal. Ultimately some 90% of construction waste was recycled.\nSometimes the latest, greenest technology just isn't approved yet.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:93d84fe4-9bf8-4198-bbe2-38f9d0db8843>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "The building sector is the biggest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the U.S. Energy used in U.S. buildings produces about 43 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. However, buildings certified under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) have less impact on the environment, according to theGreen Building Impact Report 2008. The report assessed non-residential construction because it accounts for 40 percent of the environmental burden from the buildings sector.\nLEED certified buildings have less impact on the land and water, and use 25 percent less energy. They save the equivalent amount of GHG emissions from entering the environment as 400 million vehicle miles traveled. They also use seven percent less water. The equivalent of 2008 water savings could fill enough 32 ounce bottled to encircle the globe 300 times.\nThe Architecture 2030 Challenge\nThe Architecture 2030 Challenge calls for a 50 percent reduction in the energy use and GHG emissions of all new buildings and major renovations by 2010. The Challenge also calls for an increasing reduction of both energy use and GHG emissions in increments every five years so all new buildings will be carbon neutral by 2030.\nThe Challenge also calls for new buildings to be designed so that they cut fossil fuel energy usage in half, and renovate existing buildings to cut their fossil fuel energy usage in half.\nThe following organizations have adopted the Challenge: the American Institute of Architects, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, U.S. Green Building Council, National Association of Counties, California Public Utilities and Energy Commissions, and individual cities, counties and states.\nWill the recession affect the green building sector?\nThe green building sector has grown considerably in the 21st century. Despite the current economic recession, the construction and certification of green buildings will continue to increase, according to a recent report, How Green a Recession? – Sustainability Prospects in the US Real Estate Industry.\nThe report, commissioned by RREEF, a member of the Deutsche Bank Group, stated that the green building market will continue to accelerate, which will increase the “green share” of the building sector, and then will speed markets “to the tipping point where green buildings become the standard for quality real estate product.”\nThere is a potential for tremendous growth in the green building sector, according to the report, for four reasons:\nThe report cited four ways that the Obama administration can influence green building market:\nAct local!", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:abeedbcb-3857-4d22-a378-024d58605352>::chunk-0", "doc-<urn:uuid:a36f527d-6fcd-446b-b7b3-ff01e3724339>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "How Green Is Your Building?\nThe United States accounted for 20 percent of global energy consumption in 2008, which is the largest share of world energy consumption by any country. And buildings account for 40 percent of all energy use, consuming more energy than the industrial or transportation sectors. The U.S. is also responsible for 20 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, with energy use in buildings responsible for 8 percent. With increasing focus on the energy, carbon and environmental footprint of buildings, new methods of construction are being considered. Due to their potential to reduce energy consumption, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, reduce water usage, and add to the building value, green buildings have been gaining attention in the United States.\nGreen buildings have been defined by the Environmental Protection Agency as structures that are built using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building’s lifecycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction. These buildings embody increased efficiencies in resource utilization, sustainable site planning, reduced wastage and environmental impacts, enhanced economic performance, and an overall positive impact on quality of inhabitance of such spaces and on its occupants. Green buildings thus address design concerns of economy, utility, durability and comfort.\nThe U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) has led the movement toward high-performance buildings. In 1998, the Council undertook the task of developing and subsequently administering the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) suite of certification systems, focused on evaluating sustainable building achievements with an integrated, whole building approach. This approach combines the design, construction, and operation aspects of a building to get an aggregate performance quotient that would make it a sustainable building or project. LEED promotes a whole-building approach to sustainability by focusing on the key performance areas:\nSustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, locations and linkages, awareness and education, innovation in design and regional priority\nSince the first version was introduced in 2000, the LEED system has become synonymous with sustainable design, not only in the United States, but in many other countries that have developed regional chapters of the Green Building Council to represent local dynamics, including Canada, Brazil, Mexico and India. While LEED was originally based on design and construction requirements and benchmarks rather than performance, the USGBC has taken steps to move closer to a performance-based system.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:db8bfa8c-55b1-44ea-b839-a987796fb553>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "The latest version of LEED places more focus on energy efficiency and reduction of carbon dioxide; identifies existing credits for bonus points based on specific regional issues to reflect local priorities; and tightens the energy savings requirements to 10 percent over the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standard for 2007 for new buildings, and 5 percent for renovations. In addition, LEED 2009 was designed to help the USGBC obtain a better understanding of the relationship between credits and building performance. With this goal in mind, LEED 2009 requires that teams agree to report post-occupancy energy and water use as part of project registration. By monitoring energy and water usage, the USGBC is attempting to ensure energy savings goals are being met and to determine ways to constantly make the standard more effective.\nDue to constant improvement to the rating system and the increasing trend toward sustainable building practices, LEED certifications have been on the rise.\nWhile the number of LEED certifications has steadily increased and many buildings strive to attain LEED certification, LEED certification is voluntary and, as a result, many buildings are not LEED certified. Even when buildings are certified, under LEED, building owners may choose to address certain aspects of energy efficiency, such as lighting, but leave other aspects out. Furthermore, when given a choice, some building owners are choosing not to follow these guidelines at all in order to reduce their initial investment, without considering the total cost of ownership and the building’s impact on the environment.\nTo address this issue, the U.S. has approved its first national green building code. The International Green Construction Code (IgCC) was passed after two years of development. The code applies to all new and renovated commercial buildings and residential buildings higher than three stories. The goal of IgCC is to set enforceable minimum standards for all aspects of building design and construction, including energy efficiency, water efficiency, site impacts, building waste and materials. The code also gives voluntary certifications more flexibility to set the high-performance requirements even higher so that buildings are awarded for going above the minimum standards of performance, instead of being awarded for meeting what have increasingly become expected standards.\nOne of the mandatory requirements is related to site development and land use. The IgCC eliminates greenfield development, with some exceptions based on existing infrastructure.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:db8bfa8c-55b1-44ea-b839-a987796fb553>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "Whether green buildings will be voluntary or mandated in New Jersey, the overall green construction trend is booming despite the US housing slump.\nGreen home building has already gone mainstream and is expected to be worth $12 to $20 billion (6%-10% of the market) this year, according to a new report from McGraw-Hill. The report said that 40% of builders think green building helps them market their homes in a down market.\n“We have hit the tipping point for builders going green. This year has seen an 8% jump over last year, and we expect another 10% increase next year.”\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said they are also implementing new green building strategies in order to spread the adoption of green building practices nationwide.\nWhile major businesses such as Kohl’s, Roche, Chevron, among many announced their green building investments, chemical companies, on the other hand, are trying to cash in on this trend with new environment-friendly/energy-saving construction materials.\nBerry Plastics said its formaldehyde-free Thermo-ply protective sheating is a non-toxic 100% polyvinyl alcohol, which reduces home energy use by lessening air infiltration. The sheating is said to be also constructed with 100% recycled materials (80% post consumer waste and 20% post-industrial material), and is 99% recyclable.\nWith asbestos and lead paint litigations still nipping some chemical firms’ heels, and if green building will potentially be mandated in some states, it is advisable for both construction and chemical industries to look for friendlier alternatives.\nIn a related issue, the consulting firm EH&E recently released a white paper to help building owners, developers, and others minimize the looming risks and costs caused by the discovery of PCBs in their construction materials.\naddthis_pub = ‘greenchicgeek’;", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:d933bd24-49d5-4db4-8c1e-7ade57b54e5b>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Green building is not a new fashion stream in design and architecture. Green building is a possibility to create harmless, energy efficient and environmentally friendly buildings. In the 1970s energy crises and environmental pollution affected on the progress of sustainable buildings. The price for sustainable products and materials fall, green buildings are becoming good for the environment, tenants and occupiers. Conventional building consumes too much natural sources, like energy, water, woods etc. while green building uses renewable resources as sunlight, plants, rainwater. Green building is a LEED-certified (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) building. One of the most important components of green building are energy and water efficient technologies which are generally not available in regular buildings. Although green building is more effective and good for bottom line, when creating it construction employers and designers should take into consideration some disadvantages too.\nAdvantages of Green Building:\nVery often green building is considered to be expensive as usually all kind of modern building methods. However it saves much more money from the moment of creating during its lifetime as ordinary buildings. It works with any kind of green structures – office buildings, schools, churches, factories and others type of buildings. Designing and building green structures cost approximately the same as regular buildings. Even if they are higher in cost a little bit, because of some special requirements, during their usage they save so much energy that the money spent on its creation will return at least 10 times. The Californian Sustainable Building Task Force carried out a study in 2003. According to this study even 20% of investment into green building will elaborate 10 times more saving. So there is no significant difference in prices. A green building can be expensive as much as a conventional building.\n• Energy efficiency\nGreen building has a great advantage of reducing both embodied and operating energy consumption. Studies proved that those buildings which are built with wood will have a lower embodied energy than buildings made of brick, steel or other materials. What about operating energy? Designers try to find solutions to reduce it too. They use extra-insulation, high-performance windows, and passive solar design. The latter is very efficient especially if the windows are effectively placed. Also other ways of renewable energy are used too. Wind power and hydro power can also notably reduce the influence on environment.\n• Water efficiency\nWater consumption is another objective in sustainable building.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:d18176f2-9392-443e-ad21-f3c361e74d9e>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "March 7, 2010\n\"Reduce, reuse, recycle\" has become a common catch-phrase in today's society.

As such, the integrated building design process has proven to be effective for net-zero energy projects.\nCommissioning is an important part of every project, and for NZEB projects the commissioning authority should be a member of the design team and involved throughout the design process.

While some may dismiss “green” as a passing trend, regulators from local to federal levels are creating laws and regulations that will ensure green building is around to stay for at least the near future. Perhaps most significantly, recent EPA action will regulate nearly every commercial building by 2016.\nProbably the most established and best known of the standards used for green building is the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards. Instituted in 2000 by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), the LEED system awards credits for buildings based on certain factors in specified categories.

The uniform code will make it easier for municipalities, especially smaller ones, to adopt comprehensive and functioning green building codes.\nState and Municipal Regulations\nA variety of states and municipalities have started to require some green or sustainable construction on both new projects and remodels. California has created its own standards with the CalGreen regulations. Utah and Arizona, among other states, have adopted requirements that certain public buildings comply with some level of LEED certification.\nThe regulations are a potpourri of forms and functions. Some regulations only apply to public buildings, while others apply to both public and private buildings. About 40 percent only apply to new construction while the other 60 percent apply to existing buildings. Notably, a handful of regulations apply to existing buildings on which no construction is occurring.\nThe majority of states and municipalities use the LEED system as a guide. LEED is an easy choice because it offers an established set of standards to entities without the manpower or expertise to create their own. Once the green code is finalized, regulators will likely shift away from regulatory reliance on LEED and use the code instead.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:dc2b3bd3-d113-4dc9-a283-269b8b069273>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "|Part of a series about|\nGreen building (also known as green construction or sustainable building) refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort.\nLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. Other certificates system that confirms the sustainability of buildings is the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments. Currently, World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with World Bank to promote Green Buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Market Transformation Program and certification. There are also other tools such as Green Star in Australia and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia.\nAlthough new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures, the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by:\n- Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources\n- Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity (see healthy building)\n- Reducing waste, pollution and environmental degradation\nA similar concept is natural building, which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally. Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Although some green building programs don't address the issue of the retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction.\nA 2009 report by the U.S. General Services Administration found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance.

In 2010, California passed the nation's first mandatory statewide green building code, which took effect last year. Meanwhile, more than half of all states have adopted the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code, a standard created by the International Code Council, a U.S.-based nonprofit, which requires buildings to meet efficiency standards for heating units and air conditioners, water heaters and lighting.\nAs a result of these and other policies, efficiency fixes such as energy-efficient lighting and appliances, insulation, tightly sealed windows and rooftop solar panels, have become common in new and renovated buildings. Green construction jumped from two percent of new non-residential buildings in 2005 to nearly 30 percent in 2010, according to the latest figures from McGraw Hill Construction, a publisher of construction information.\nMarket forces are also at play. While it can be expensive to make buildings energy efficient, the return on investment, mainly from avoided electricity or heating costs, is nearly 10 percent higher than from conventional buildings, according to McGraw Hill.\nGreen builders can also receive thousands in rebates and tax incentives from state governments, allowing them to recoup upfront costs even faster. An additional lure: A building with green features generally has higher value, occupancy rates and can fetch higher rents than it would otherwise.\n\nDocument 2: These numbers are getting the attention of developers and driving the growth of eco-construction. Nationally, about 2% of today's new, nonresidential construction is considered green, estimates the MHC study. From last year's $3.3 billion, green office and retail construction is expected to surge by up to 10% a year, to $20 billion, by 2010.\nCosts Backing Down\nGiven New York's love affair with tall towers and the unmatched scale of the city's real estate market, it's no surprise that Manhattan is emerging as the epicenter of green high-rise construction. Bank of America's tower will be the greenest of a surge of eco-friendly office buildings sprouting up in midtown and near Wall Street.\nFirst to open was 7 World Trade Center, the start of new construction at Ground Zero. Next was Foster + Partners' stunning addition to Hearst's headquarters in midtown. And nearing completion just a few blocks west of Bank of America Tower on 42nd Street is Renzo Piano's New York Times Building.\nThe flurry of eco-construction reflects builders' growing confidence that the extra costs of building green are a good investment. The up front costs of building green are still higher than using conventional materials, but that premium is shrinking. Just a few years ago, green construction could cost 10% or more than standard construction.\nToday that margin has fallen into the range of single digits. As the market for green materials and design expertise has grown and matured, \"the supply of materials and services is going up and the price is coming down,\" says Taryn Holowka, communications manager at the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).\nWaterless Water Closets\nTo be sure, green projects can still throw up costly delays or surprising snafus. Until recently, for example, New York-area carting companies charged extra to sort and recycle construction debris.\nBut as haulers have come to recognize the market value of the refuse, they've lowered their prices and become more cooperative. At the Bank of America site, explains Cook+Fox's Lisa Storer, carting companies presorted scrap steel, concrete, and other debris on site for removal. Ultimately some 90% of construction waste was recycled.\nSometimes the latest, greenest technology just isn't approved yet.\n\nDocument 3: The building sector is the biggest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the U.S. Energy used in U.S. buildings produces about 43 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.

And buildings account for 40 percent of all energy use, consuming more energy than the industrial or transportation sectors. The U.S. is also responsible for 20 percent of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions, with energy use in buildings responsible for 8 percent. With increasing focus on the energy, carbon and environmental footprint of buildings, new methods of construction are being considered. Due to their potential to reduce energy consumption, decrease greenhouse gas emissions, reduce water usage, and add to the building value, green buildings have been gaining attention in the United States.\nGreen buildings have been defined by the Environmental Protection Agency as structures that are built using processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building’s lifecycle from siting to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation and deconstruction. These buildings embody increased efficiencies in resource utilization, sustainable site planning, reduced wastage and environmental impacts, enhanced economic performance, and an overall positive impact on quality of inhabitance of such spaces and on its occupants. Green buildings thus address design concerns of economy, utility, durability and comfort.\nThe U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) has led the movement toward high-performance buildings. In 1998, the Council undertook the task of developing and subsequently administering the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) suite of certification systems, focused on evaluating sustainable building achievements with an integrated, whole building approach. This approach combines the design, construction, and operation aspects of a building to get an aggregate performance quotient that would make it a sustainable building or project. LEED promotes a whole-building approach to sustainability by focusing on the key performance areas:\nSustainable sites, water efficiency, energy and atmosphere, materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, locations and linkages, awareness and education, innovation in design and regional priority\nSince the first version was introduced in 2000, the LEED system has become synonymous with sustainable design, not only in the United States, but in many other countries that have developed regional chapters of the Green Building Council to represent local dynamics, including Canada, Brazil, Mexico and India. While LEED was originally based on design and construction requirements and benchmarks rather than performance, the USGBC has taken steps to move closer to a performance-based system.\n\nDocument 6: The latest version of LEED places more focus on energy efficiency and reduction of carbon dioxide; identifies existing credits for bonus points based on specific regional issues to reflect local priorities; and tightens the energy savings requirements to 10 percent over the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standard for 2007 for new buildings, and 5 percent for renovations. In addition, LEED 2009 was designed to help the USGBC obtain a better understanding of the relationship between credits and building performance. With this goal in mind, LEED 2009 requires that teams agree to report post-occupancy energy and water use as part of project registration. By monitoring energy and water usage, the USGBC is attempting to ensure energy savings goals are being met and to determine ways to constantly make the standard more effective.\nDue to constant improvement to the rating system and the increasing trend toward sustainable building practices, LEED certifications have been on the rise.\nWhile the number of LEED certifications has steadily increased and many buildings strive to attain LEED certification, LEED certification is voluntary and, as a result, many buildings are not LEED certified. Even when buildings are certified, under LEED, building owners may choose to address certain aspects of energy efficiency, such as lighting, but leave other aspects out. Furthermore, when given a choice, some building owners are choosing not to follow these guidelines at all in order to reduce their initial investment, without considering the total cost of ownership and the building’s impact on the environment.\nTo address this issue, the U.S. has approved its first national green building code. The International Green Construction Code (IgCC) was passed after two years of development. The code applies to all new and renovated commercial buildings and residential buildings higher than three stories. The goal of IgCC is to set enforceable minimum standards for all aspects of building design and construction, including energy efficiency, water efficiency, site impacts, building waste and materials. The code also gives voluntary certifications more flexibility to set the high-performance requirements even higher so that buildings are awarded for going above the minimum standards of performance, instead of being awarded for meeting what have increasingly become expected standards.\nOne of the mandatory requirements is related to site development and land use. The IgCC eliminates greenfield development, with some exceptions based on existing infrastructure.\n\nDocument 7: Whether green buildings will be voluntary or mandated in New Jersey, the overall green construction trend is booming despite the US housing slump.\nGreen home building has already gone mainstream and is expected to be worth $12 to $20 billion (6%-10% of the market) this year, according to a new report from McGraw-Hill. The report said that 40% of builders think green building helps them market their homes in a down market.\n“We have hit the tipping point for builders going green. This year has seen an 8% jump over last year, and we expect another 10% increase next year.”\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) said they are also implementing new green building strategies in order to spread the adoption of green building practices nationwide.\nWhile major businesses such as Kohl’s, Roche, Chevron, among many announced their green building investments, chemical companies, on the other hand, are trying to cash in on this trend with new environment-friendly/energy-saving construction materials.\nBerry Plastics said its formaldehyde-free Thermo-ply protective sheating is a non-toxic 100% polyvinyl alcohol, which reduces home energy use by lessening air infiltration. The sheating is said to be also constructed with 100% recycled materials (80% post consumer waste and 20% post-industrial material), and is 99% recyclable.\nWith asbestos and lead paint litigations still nipping some chemical firms’ heels, and if green building will potentially be mandated in some states, it is advisable for both construction and chemical industries to look for friendlier alternatives.\nIn a related issue, the consulting firm EH&E recently released a white paper to help building owners, developers, and others minimize the looming risks and costs caused by the discovery of PCBs in their construction materials.\naddthis_pub = ‘greenchicgeek’;\n\nDocument 8: Green building is not a new fashion stream in design and architecture. Green building is a possibility to create harmless, energy efficient and environmentally friendly buildings. In the 1970s energy crises and environmental pollution affected on the progress of sustainable buildings. The price for sustainable products and materials fall, green buildings are becoming good for the environment, tenants and occupiers. Conventional building consumes too much natural sources, like energy, water, woods etc. while green building uses renewable resources as sunlight, plants, rainwater. Green building is a LEED-certified (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) building. One of the most important components of green building are energy and water efficient technologies which are generally not available in regular buildings. Although green building is more effective and good for bottom line, when creating it construction employers and designers should take into consideration some disadvantages too.\nAdvantages of Green Building:\nVery often green building is considered to be expensive as usually all kind of modern building methods. However it saves much more money from the moment of creating during its lifetime as ordinary buildings. It works with any kind of green structures – office buildings, schools, churches, factories and others type of buildings. Designing and building green structures cost approximately the same as regular buildings. Even if they are higher in cost a little bit, because of some special requirements, during their usage they save so much energy that the money spent on its creation will return at least 10 times. The Californian Sustainable Building Task Force carried out a study in 2003. According to this study even 20% of investment into green building will elaborate 10 times more saving. So there is no significant difference in prices. A green building can be expensive as much as a conventional building.\n• Energy efficiency\nGreen building has a great advantage of reducing both embodied and operating energy consumption. Studies proved that those buildings which are built with wood will have a lower embodied energy than buildings made of brick, steel or other materials. What about operating energy? Designers try to find solutions to reduce it too. They use extra-insulation, high-performance windows, and passive solar design. The latter is very efficient especially if the windows are effectively placed. Also other ways of renewable energy are used too. Wind power and hydro power can also notably reduce the influence on environment.\n• Water efficiency\nWater consumption is another objective in sustainable building.\n\nDocument 9: March 7, 2010\n\"Reduce, reuse, recycle\" has become a common catch-phrase in today's society.

However, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of more than 10% between 2017 and 2023, according to the United Nations’ Principles for Responsible Investment.\nGeorgina Smit, GBCSA head of Sector Development and Market Transformation, adds that the value of certified green buildings is expected to become even more pronounced as the world navigates through the challenges presented by Covid-19. “Post the Covid-19 crisis, many companies are likely to review health measures put in place in their offices. Harvard University recently found that long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with an 8% increase in the Covid-19 death rate, and the improved internal environment quality from increased ventilation, temperature and lighting control, the use of natural light, and the absence of toxic materials result in the improved health, comfort and wellbeing of green building occupants. In a post-pandemic world, these factors can no longer be overlooked. Internal environmental quality is a key consideration within the GBCSA’s Green Star green building frameworks,” she explains.\nAllison believes that the business case for green buildings is getting stronger all the time, and screening in favour of sustainability, resilience and future-proofing will become more and more common. “As the bar shifts, it will become the new standard.\nThe day will come when no one will want to own or occupy the ‘brown’ buildings and infrastructure. Then those will increasingly be sold at a discount – or updated at substantial cost. Buildings that are designed with the future in mind, with smart building technology and interactivity integrated throughout, making them as responsive and adaptable to the needs of the workforce in a post-Covid-19 world today as those in the future, are more resilient and less likely to become stranded assets that no asset manager or building owner wants.”\n\nDocument 12: A subsequent paper was published by NREL in June 2010 titled “Net-Zero Energy Buildings: A Classification System Based on Renewable Energy Supply Options,” where four classifications of NZEBs were defined:\nNZEB:A: Building generates and uses energy through a combination of energy efficiency and renewable energy (RE) collected within the building footprint.NZEB:B: Building generates and uses energy through a combination of energy efficiency, RE generated within the footprint, and RE generated within the site.NZEB:C: Building generates and uses energy through a combination of energy efficiency, RE generated within the footprint, RE generated within the site, and off-site renewable resources that are brought on site to produce energy.NZEB:D: Building uses the energy strategies described for NZEB:A, NZEB:B, and/or NZEB:C buildings, and also purchases certified off-site RE such as Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) from certified sources.\nIn the ASHRAE Vision 2020 report, net-zero site energy is the building type chosen through an agreement of understanding between ASHRAE, the American Institute of Architects (AIA), the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), and the Illuminating Engineering Society (IES). [...]\nIntegrated building design\nIntegrated building design is a process that promotes holistic collaboration of a project team during all phases of the project delivery and discourages the traditional sequential philosophy. According to ASHRAE, the purpose of the integrated design process is to use a collaborative team effort to prepare design and construction documents that result in an optimized project system solution that is responsive to the objectives defined for the project. NZEB must be designed collaboratively using a “whole systems” approach recognizing that the building and its systems are interdependent. As such, the integrated building design process has proven to be effective for net-zero energy projects.\nCommissioning is an important part of every project, and for NZEB projects the commissioning authority should be a member of the design team and involved throughout the design process.

California has created its own standards with the CalGreen regulations. Utah and Arizona, among other states, have adopted requirements that certain public buildings comply with some level of LEED certification.\nThe regulations are a potpourri of forms and functions. Some regulations only apply to public buildings, while others apply to both public and private buildings. About 40 percent only apply to new construction while the other 60 percent apply to existing buildings. Notably, a handful of regulations apply to existing buildings on which no construction is occurring.\nThe majority of states and municipalities use the LEED system as a guide. LEED is an easy choice because it offers an established set of standards to entities without the manpower or expertise to create their own. Once the green code is finalized, regulators will likely shift away from regulatory reliance on LEED and use the code instead.\n\nDocument 14: |Part of a series about|\nGreen building (also known as green construction or sustainable building) refers to both a structure and the application of processes that are environmentally responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle: from planning to design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. This requires close cooperation of the contractor, the architects, the engineers, and the client at all project stages. The Green Building practice expands and complements the classical building design concerns of economy, utility, durability, and comfort.\nLeadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) is a set of rating systems for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of green buildings which was developed by the U.S. Green Building Council. Other certificates system that confirms the sustainability of buildings is the British BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) for buildings and large-scale developments. Currently, World Green Building Council is conducting research on the effects of green buildings on the health and productivity of their users and is working with World Bank to promote Green Buildings in Emerging Markets through EDGE (Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies) Market Transformation Program and certification. There are also other tools such as Green Star in Australia and the Green Building Index (GBI) predominantly used in Malaysia.\nAlthough new technologies are constantly being developed to complement current practices in creating greener structures, the common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by:\n- Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources\n- Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity (see healthy building)\n- Reducing waste, pollution and environmental degradation\nA similar concept is natural building, which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally. Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs. Although some green building programs don't address the issue of the retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction.\nA 2009 report by the U.S. General Services Administration found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance. In addition, occupants were overall more satisfied with the building than those in typical commercial buildings. These are eco-friendly buildings.\n\nQuestion: What percentage of new non-residential buildings were considered 'green construction' in 2010 compared to 2005?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "In 2010, nearly 30 percent of new non-residential buildings were considered 'green construction', compared to two percent in 2005. This significant increase from 2% to 30% highlights a dramatic rise in the adoption of green construction practices in non-residential buildings over the five-year period from 2005 to 2010. The growth suggests a rising awareness and commitment to sustainable building practices within the industry, reflecting broader societal shifts towards sustainability. This trend underscores the growing importance of environmental considerations in construction."}

There were also twenty-five sitcoms, eight of which were new. There were seven westerns (and this is stretching the definition of \"western\" to include shows like Daniel Boone and Here Come The Brides), but nothing new. As for the genre that would dominate the 1970s and beyond, the cop or detective series, there were only eight of those – none of them new either. A \"wheel\" series – a show that rotated several unrelated dramas – included a cop series as well as a medical drama (one of three that debuted in 1969) and the only lawyer show of the year.

The show was an adaptation of Robbins' novel of the same name featuring the lifestyle of the rich and famous.

One show that ran only two year was The Bill Cosby Show, his first solo effort, after being teamed with Robert Culp in I Spy. Cosby played high school basketball coach Chet Kincaid. The situations on the show rotated around his work as a teacher and his dealings with his family. One rather unique feature of the show was that it didn't feature a laugh track. I was a big fan of Bill Cosby when this show came out, in part of course because of I Spy but primarily because of his records, which were everywhere, and of course from his appearances on various variety shows. In my opinion Cosby's 1969 show had a lot in common with his stand-up act, and I don't think that extensive use of a laugh track wouldn't have done a service to the show.\nBesides Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, the two sitcoms that didn't last out the year were both from NBC: Debbie Reynolds Show, and My World And Welcome To It. The two shows couldn't have been more different. Debbie Reynolds's series was a standard domestic comedy with a very familiar hook to most episodes. A bored housewife desperately wants to break into her husband's line of work, a process which usually involves harebrained schemes involving the lead character and her best friend – or in this case her sister – much to the distress of both of their husbands. It sounds exactly like I Love Lucy, which is no real surprise since the show was created by Jess Openheimer who also created I Love Lucy (and before that Lucille Ball's radio show My Favourite Husband). The other show couldn't have been more different. It was My World And Welcome To It starring William Windom in a role based on James Thurber. Indeed Thurber's writings provided the plot for many of the stories on the series while his cartoons were the basis for a number of fantasy sequences. These were animated by the DePatie-Freleng animation studio, then most famous for the opening credits of the Pink Panther movies. The series was perhaps too innovative for 1969.\nOf the four variety series introduced in 1969, the successes were The Jim Nabors Hour on CBS, and The Andy Williams Show on NBC.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:7edd78b2-d72c-42bf-aa9c-ea80fcebae78>::chunk-5"]}, {"passage": "Variety shows, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts including musical performances, sketch comedy, magic, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism.

The genre proliferated during the Golden Age of Television, generally considered to be roughly 1948 to 1960.

The other networks didn't face such obvious problems, but then again they weren't being as daring in programming. The only show that either of the other two networks cancelled at the midseason point was The Leslie Uggams Show which was the first hour long variety show to be hosted by an African-American. It only lasted ten episodes.\nThe networks reacted to the cancellation of these shows in a way that would surprise people today – the moved established shows. Today this sort of thing would be regarded with horror by fans. Conventional wisdom is that moving a series to a new night at any time let alone during the season is not unlike getting a kiss from a Mafia Don – you won't survive – but it was what was done in 1969. ABC moved It Takes A Thief and the Wednesday Night Movie to Monday night (the latter show got a name change of course). The only survivor of the Monday night line-up, Love American Style replaced Jimmy Durante Presents The Lennon Sisters which in turn moved to replace Hollywood Palace (which in turn followed Lawrence Welk, the show where the Lennon Sisters originally debuted). To replace the Wednesday Night Movie ABC revived a series that had run the previous summer – The Johnny Cash Show. The Flying Nun moved to replace Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, and was in turn replaced by Nanny And The Professor. I haven't been able to identify the show that followed Johnny Cash, or what went into the time slot vacated by It Takes a Thief. Over at CBS the time slot after Ed Sullivan, which had been held down by The Leslie Uggams Show became the new home of The Glenn Campbell Goodtime Hour, while Campbell's old time was taken over by a new series called Hee Haw, which everybody hated, except of course the public (or at least that part of the public that the critics disliked).\nThe successful dramas that debuted in 1969 seem to have one thing in common. That is a mentor-protégé relationship. In ABC's Marcus Welby M.D. the mentor was the title character, a caring general practitioner who works out of his home and actually made house calls (!", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:7edd78b2-d72c-42bf-aa9c-ea80fcebae78>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "The exceptions were Misterjaw and Crazylegs Crane, which were produced specifically for television and never re-released theatrically, resulting in laughter-only versions.\nFollowing Filmation were producers Sid and Marty Krofft. When production began on H.R. Pufnstuf in 1969, executive producer Si Rose viewed any comedy without a laugh track as a handicap, and convinced the Kroffts to include one on Pufnstuf. After Pufnstuf, the Kroffts employed Douglass's services on all shows produced for Saturday morning television (except for Land of the Lost, which was more dramatic in nature), including The Bugaloos, Lidsville, Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, The Lost Saucer and Far Out Space Nuts. When transitioning from high concept children's programming to live variety shows, the Kroffts continued to employ Douglass for sweetening. Several shows included Donny and Marie, The Brady Bunch Variety Hour, The Krofft Supershow, The Krofft Superstar Hour, Pink Lady and Jeff, Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters, Pryor's Place, as well as their 1987 syndicated sitcom D.C. Follies.\nAs the use of laugh tracks for Saturday morning series became more common, Douglass eventually added several children's laughs to his library. \"Kiddie laughs\", as they are known, first saw use for sweetening for the 1973 syndicated television special, The World of Sid and Marty Krofft at the Hollywood Bowl, but were soon heard on most Saturday morning kids' shows by 1974, such as Uncle Croc's Block, Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, The Pink Panther Show, The Lost Saucer and Far Out Space Nuts.\nCurrent Disney Channel-produced sitcoms and studio-created laugh tracks are primarily recorded in front of live audiences.

The situations on the show rotated around his work as a teacher and his dealings with his family. One rather unique feature of the show was that it didn't feature a laugh track. I was a big fan of Bill Cosby when this show came out, in part of course because of I Spy but primarily because of his records, which were everywhere, and of course from his appearances on various variety shows. In my opinion Cosby's 1969 show had a lot in common with his stand-up act, and I don't think that extensive use of a laugh track wouldn't have done a service to the show.\nBesides Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, the two sitcoms that didn't last out the year were both from NBC: Debbie Reynolds Show, and My World And Welcome To It. The two shows couldn't have been more different. Debbie Reynolds's series was a standard domestic comedy with a very familiar hook to most episodes. A bored housewife desperately wants to break into her husband's line of work, a process which usually involves harebrained schemes involving the lead character and her best friend – or in this case her sister – much to the distress of both of their husbands. It sounds exactly like I Love Lucy, which is no real surprise since the show was created by Jess Openheimer who also created I Love Lucy (and before that Lucille Ball's radio show My Favourite Husband). The other show couldn't have been more different. It was My World And Welcome To It starring William Windom in a role based on James Thurber. Indeed Thurber's writings provided the plot for many of the stories on the series while his cartoons were the basis for a number of fantasy sequences. These were animated by the DePatie-Freleng animation studio, then most famous for the opening credits of the Pink Panther movies. The series was perhaps too innovative for 1969.\nOf the four variety series introduced in 1969, the successes were The Jim Nabors Hour on CBS, and The Andy Williams Show on NBC.\n\nDocument 4: Variety shows, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts including musical performances, sketch comedy, magic, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. It is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio and then television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from the late 1940s into the 1980s.\nWhile still widespread in some parts of the world, the proliferation of multichannel television and evolving viewer tastes have affected the popularity of variety shows in the United States. Despite this, their influence has still had a major effect on late night television whose late night talk shows and NBC's variety series Saturday Night Live (which originally premiered in 1975) have remained popular fixtures of North American television.\nThe live entertainment style known as music hall in the United Kingdom and vaudeville in the United States can be considered a direct predecessor of the \"variety show\" format. Variety in the UK evolved in theatres and music halls, and later in Working Men's Clubs. Most of the early top performers on British television and radio did an apprenticeship either in stage variety, or during World War II in Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). In the UK, the ultimate accolade for a variety artist for decades was to be asked to do the annual Royal Command Performance at the London Palladium theatre, in front of the monarch.\nIn the United States, former vaudeville performers such as the Marx Brothers, George Burns and Gracie Allen, W. C. Fields, and Jack Benny honed their skills in the Borscht Belt before moving to talkies, to radio shows, and then to television shows, including variety shows.\nVariety shows were among the first programs to be featured on television during the experimental mechanical television era. Variety shows hosted by Helen Haynes and Harriet Lee are recorded in contemporary newspapers in 1931 and 1932; because of technical limits of the era, no recordings of either show have been preserved. The genre proliferated during the Golden Age of Television, generally considered to be roughly 1948 to 1960. Many of these Golden Age variety shows were spinoffs of previous radio variety shows.\nFrom 1948 to 1971, The Ed Sullivan Show was one of CBS's most popular television series.\n\nDocument 5: First, there were nearly a dozen variety shows at that time -- that type show had not yet begun to die out, though it would do so shortly. Alan would have been competing with, among others: Andy Williams, Steve Lawrence, Red Skelton, Danny Kaye, Dean Martin, Jimmy Dean, the King Family, the Smothers Brothers, Jackie Gleason, Lawrence Welk, and Ed Sullivan.\nSitcoms, however, were dominating the ratings, with \"The Lucy Show\", \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"Bewitched\", \"Gomer Pyle\", \"Hogan's Heroes\", and \"The Beverly Hillbillies\" all in the top 10. Others in the top 20 included \"My Three Sons\", \"Get Smart\", \"Green Acres\" ---- and, of course, \"The Dick Van Dyke Show\" (on Wednesday nights).\nConsidering the fact that many of these shows can still be seen in syndicated re-runs almost 50 years later, it's safe to say that the '65-'66 season was a strong one -- and that Rob, Sally, and Buddy were doing very well if they were keeping an obsolescent program type in 7th -- or even 17th -- place.\n\nDocument 6: Both shows were cancelled at the mid-season mark along with a third new series, a TV version of Mr. Deeds Goes To Town starring Monte Markham and Pat Harington, and ABC venerable variety show Hollywood Palace. The other networks didn't face such obvious problems, but then again they weren't being as daring in programming. The only show that either of the other two networks cancelled at the midseason point was The Leslie Uggams Show which was the first hour long variety show to be hosted by an African-American. It only lasted ten episodes.\nThe networks reacted to the cancellation of these shows in a way that would surprise people today – the moved established shows. Today this sort of thing would be regarded with horror by fans. Conventional wisdom is that moving a series to a new night at any time let alone during the season is not unlike getting a kiss from a Mafia Don – you won't survive – but it was what was done in 1969. ABC moved It Takes A Thief and the Wednesday Night Movie to Monday night (the latter show got a name change of course). The only survivor of the Monday night line-up, Love American Style replaced Jimmy Durante Presents The Lennon Sisters which in turn moved to replace Hollywood Palace (which in turn followed Lawrence Welk, the show where the Lennon Sisters originally debuted). To replace the Wednesday Night Movie ABC revived a series that had run the previous summer – The Johnny Cash Show. The Flying Nun moved to replace Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, and was in turn replaced by Nanny And The Professor. I haven't been able to identify the show that followed Johnny Cash, or what went into the time slot vacated by It Takes a Thief. Over at CBS the time slot after Ed Sullivan, which had been held down by The Leslie Uggams Show became the new home of The Glenn Campbell Goodtime Hour, while Campbell's old time was taken over by a new series called Hee Haw, which everybody hated, except of course the public (or at least that part of the public that the critics disliked).\nThe successful dramas that debuted in 1969 seem to have one thing in common. That is a mentor-protégé relationship. In ABC's Marcus Welby M.D. the mentor was the title character, a caring general practitioner who works out of his home and actually made house calls (!\n\nDocument 7: The exceptions were Misterjaw and Crazylegs Crane, which were produced specifically for television and never re-released theatrically, resulting in laughter-only versions.\nFollowing Filmation were producers Sid and Marty Krofft. When production began on H.R. Pufnstuf in 1969, executive producer Si Rose viewed any comedy without a laugh track as a handicap, and convinced the Kroffts to include one on Pufnstuf. After Pufnstuf, the Kroffts employed Douglass's services on all shows produced for Saturday morning television (except for Land of the Lost, which was more dramatic in nature), including The Bugaloos, Lidsville, Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, The Lost Saucer and Far Out Space Nuts. When transitioning from high concept children's programming to live variety shows, the Kroffts continued to employ Douglass for sweetening. Several shows included Donny and Marie, The Brady Bunch Variety Hour, The Krofft Supershow, The Krofft Superstar Hour, Pink Lady and Jeff, Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters, Pryor's Place, as well as their 1987 syndicated sitcom D.C. Follies.\nAs the use of laugh tracks for Saturday morning series became more common, Douglass eventually added several children's laughs to his library. \"Kiddie laughs\", as they are known, first saw use for sweetening for the 1973 syndicated television special, The World of Sid and Marty Krofft at the Hollywood Bowl, but were soon heard on most Saturday morning kids' shows by 1974, such as Uncle Croc's Block, Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, The Pink Panther Show, The Lost Saucer and Far Out Space Nuts.\nCurrent Disney Channel-produced sitcoms and studio-created laugh tracks are primarily recorded in front of live audiences. Nickelodeon – Disney's top competitor – utilizes a laugh track for shows such as iCarly and Victorious since closing the original studio facilities fitted for live audience seating.\nMaking their ownEdit\nBy 1970, Douglass's laugh business was proving so lucrative that he decided to raise the rates for his services. However, unlike sitcoms, cartoons were mainly produced with lower budgets and studios looked for opportunities to reduce costs. Hanna-Barbera and Rankin-Bass distanced themselves from Douglass starting in 1971.\n\nDocument 8: Using his no-nonsense approach, Ed Sullivan allowed many acts from several different mediums to get their \"fifteen minutes of fame\". Sullivan was also partially responsible for bringing Elvis Presley and The Beatles to prominence in the United States.\nIn the UK, The Good Old Days—which ran from 1953 to 1983—featured modern artists performing dressed in late Victorian/Early Edwardian costume, either doing their own act or performing as a music hall artist of that period. The audience was also encouraged to dress in period costume in a similar fashion.\nOn television, variety reached its peak during the period of the 1960s and 1970s. With a turn of the television dial, viewers around the globe could variously have seen shows and occasional specials featuring Dinah Shore, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Andy Williams, Julie Andrews, The Carpenters, Olivia Newton-John, John Denver, John Davidson, Mac Davis, Bobby Goldsboro, Lynda Carter, Johnny Cash, Sonny and Cher, Bob Monkhouse, Carol Burnett, Rod Hull and Emu, Flip Wilson, Lawrence Welk, Glen Campbell, Donny & Marie Osmond, Barbara Mandrell, Judy Garland, The Captain & Tennille, The Jacksons, The Keane Brothers, Bobby Darin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Mary Tyler Moore, Dean Martin, Tony Orlando and Dawn, The Smothers Brothers, Danny Kaye, Des O'Connor, Buck and Roy, Roy Hudd, Billy Dainty, Max Wall. Manhattan Transfer, Starland Vocal Band, or The Muppet Show. Even \"The Brady Bunch\" had a variety show. Variety shows were once as common on television as Westerns, courtroom dramas, suspense thrillers, sitcoms, or (in more modern times) reality TV shows.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, there were also numerous one-time variety specials featuring stars such as Shirley MacLaine, Frank Sinatra, Diana Ross, and Mitzi Gaynor, none of whom ever had a regular television series.\nModern U.S. variety shows\n|This article needs additional citations for verification.\n\nDocument 9: In May 2014, NBC aired The Maya Rudolph Show, a variety show starring SNL performer Maya Rudolph. The broadcast was intended to be a one-off special, but with the possibility of additional episodes depending on its performance. This was the first attempt in nearly six years by NBC to bring this concept back to television (its last successful series in this genre, Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters, left the network's schedule in 1982), having struck out back in 2008 with Rosie Live. The special pulled in 7.23 million viewers in its 10 p.m. (ET/PT) timeslot, making it the third most watched program of the night.\nThe prime time variety show format was popular in the early decades of Australian television, spawning such series as In Melbourne Tonight, The Graham Kennedy Show, The Don Lane Show, and Hey Hey It's Saturday, which ran for 27 years. Recent prime time variety shows include the short lived Micallef Tonight and The Sideshow.\nAnother of today's variety shows in Asia is Taiwan's Guess (variety show) and 100% Entertainment. East Asian variety programs are known for its constant use of sound effects, on-screen visuals and comedic bantering. Many of the shows are presented in a live-like presentation in a fast-paced setting, with scenes repeating or fast forwarded.\nAnother popular variety show in Taiwan is Kangxi Lai Le, a talk show with variety show elements. The hosts and guests were associated with variety shows. Famous for its bantering, which was written before tapings.\nThe first Chinese variety show to become a major success was Hong Kong's Enjoy Yourself Tonight, which first aired in 1967 and ran for 27 years. In Hong Kong, variety shows are often combined with elements of a cooking show or a talent competition but end in various results.\nVariety programming has remained one of the dominant genres of television programming. While Japanese variety shows are famous abroad for their wild stunts, they vary from talk shows to music shows, from tabloid news shows to skit comedy. The prominent use of telop on screen has created a style that has influenced variety programming across Asia. One of the most popular variety show in Japan includes Downtown no Gaki No Tsukai.\n\nDocument 10: Popular American variety shows that began in the 60s include a revival of The Jackie Gleason Show (1960-1970), The Andy Williams Show (1962-1971), The Danny Kaye Show (1963-1967), The Hollywood Palace (1964-1970), The Dean Martin Show (1965-1974), The Carol Burnett Show (1967-1978) and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour (1967-1969). 1969 saw a flurry of new variety shows with rural appeal: The Johnny Cash Show (1969-1971), The Jim Nabors Hour (1969-1971), The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour (1969-1972) and Hee Haw (1969-1992).\nIn 1970 and 1971, the American TV networks, CBS especially, conducted the so-called \"rural purge\", in which shows that appealed to more rural and older audiences were cancelled as part of a greater focus on appealing to wealthier demographics. Many variety shows, including long-running ones, were cancelled as part of this \"purge,\" with a few shows (such as Hee Haw and The Lawrence Welk Show) surviving and moving into first-run syndication. Variety shows continued to be produced in the 1970s, with most of them stripped down to only music and comedy.\nPopular variety shows that ran in the 1970s include The Flip Wilson Show (1970-1974), The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour (1971-1976, in various incarnations), The Bobby Goldsboro Show (1973-1975), The Midnight Special (1973-1981), Don Kirshner's Rock Concert (1973-1981), The Mac Davis Show (1974-1976), Tony Orlando and Dawn (1974-1976), Donny & Marie (1976-1979) and Sha Na Na (1977-1981).\nEntertainers with weekly variety shows that ran for one season or less in the 1970s include Captain & Tennille, The Jacksons, The Keane Brothers, Bobby Darin, Mary Tyler Moore, Julie Andrews, Dolly Parton, Shields and Yarnell, The Manhattan Transfer, Starland Vocal Band, and the cast of The Brady Bunch.\n\nDocument 11: USD.

With Efram Zimbalist Jr..\nThe Hollywood Palace was an hour-long American television variety show that was broadcast weekly Saturday nights (except September 1967 to January 1968, when it was seen Monday nights) on ABC from January 4, 1964, to February 7, 1970. Titled The Saturday Night Hollywood Palace during its first few weeks, it began as a midseason replacement for The Jerry Lewis Show, another variety show, which had lasted only three months.\n\nQuestion: How many variety shows and sitcoms were on television in Fall 1969?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "In the Fall of 1969, there were fourteen variety shows and twenty-five sitcoms on television. This period marked a significant era in television history, with a diverse array of programming options available to viewers. The variety shows offered a mix of comedy, music, and variety acts, while the sitcoms provided a range of comedic storytelling and character-driven narratives. Together, these shows contributed to the rich tapestry of television content during that time."}
{"id": 25, "question": "What are the different personality types of horses and how do they respond to stress?", "passages": [{"passage": "Let me say that again, it takes the RIGHT personality using the Right technique for the Right personality. In other words, the person doing the training has to be of the right frame of mind, and MUST understand, and train to, the personality of the trainee. This may be a little confusing so, as I often do, I’ll use my wife’s horse training to clarify for us humans.\nA good horse trainer will always use the first lesson to get to know the horse. Horses, like people, have distinct personalities. Unlike people, horses are big and strong and can hurt you if you push the wrong buttons. Because we respect their size and our ultimate goal is to produce a good horse, we pay attention to who we are dealing with and train accordingly. Some will respond to training like second nature and some require warm up and praise to build confidence just to leave the stall. And the sooner you begin to understand the horse, the sooner the real training can begin.\nWhen it comes to personality, horses, like people, can generally be grouped in to four categories or styles:\n• Challenging; Prideful, Territorial, Strong Sense of Self.\n• Social; “Official Greeter”, Interactive, Easy to train.\n• Fearful; Guarded, cautious, looks to another horse or a person for strength.\n• Aloof; Independent, Delayed or Dull responses, Tends to ignore commands.\nOur Challenging horse was Faith. Faith would meet you head on in the round pen but once she understood you were serious, would perform better than her peers to prove her superiority. In the alternative, our Social horse Miss Fitz will go along with just about anything we ask her to do as long as she is getting the attention. We might use different adjectives to describe people personalities but you get the idea. Each personality has specific preferences and tendencies that we look for and use in our training techniques. Each has its advantages and challenges but understanding the horse allows us to set expectation and get the most we can out of a session and, ultimately, out of the horse. This applies to our people too!\nSo how does this change our approach to training?", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:4d99a6f4-c6c8-4506-a5ec-57a94bd40dfe>::chunk-3"]}, {"passage": "Carey Williams, Ph.D., Extension Specialist in Equine Management\nWhat is Stress?\nStress is the body’s response to anything it considers threatening. For a horse this could be anything, including trailering and traveling, showing, poor nutrition, feeding at irregular times, changes in other routines, environmental toxins, interactions within their social environment, variations in climate, and illness.\nSome types of stress include various physical stresses that are based on the physical makeup of the animal and its ability to respond to changes in diet, injury, etc. Psychological stresses are based on a horse’s personality and its perception of life. For example, some horses are more stressed than others by being in a stall for long periods of time.\nHow do Horses Cope with Stress?\nThe horse’s basic stress response starts with a change in behavior, either by moving away from a stimulus, swishing its tail, bucking, tensing up, etc. This stress will then cause activation of the sympathetic nervous system, called the “Fight or Flight” response. The sympathetic nervous system will create an involuntary action of the intestines (diarrhea), endocrine glands (production of adrenaline and cortisol), and heart (increase in heart rate). Next the neuroendocrine system will be activated, allowing the horse’s system to increase its energy utilization.\nEach horse deals with stress in a different way depending on their personality.\nDemonstrative, Confident Horse\n• Lets you know when it is stressed!\n• Bucks, kicks, bites, is very curious, mouthy, a troublemaker, etc.\nDemonstrative, Fearful Horse\n• Worries about everything!\n• Shies the first time it sees things and needs time to relax.\nPassive, Confident Horse\n• Usually wonders, “What’s everyone worried about?”\n• Not normally stressed, internalizes stress, shows little change even when stressed.\n• Usually is the last one in the field to take off running if something runs out of the woods.\nPassive, Fearful Horse\n• Wants to please!\n• Seems willing to do anything, but will tighten muscles and lips when stressed.\n• Won’t show fear until pushed over the limit.\nDuring exercise heat production will increase up to 50 %.

How individual horses respond to potentially stressful situations differs, but many health ailments are originated from stress of one kind or another.\nStress can be defined as a general term which describes the combination of psychological and biological responses of an animal during real or perceived threatening circumstances. While the physiological response to stress is a highly complex subject, and certainly is not completely understood, scientists agree that there are two types of stressors.\nPhysical stressors are things such as injury, over-exertion or a change in the environment. Psychological stressors typically include situations that make the animal anxious or fearful. Uncertainty and fear of the unknown can be categorized as two of the major psychological stressors. Competing horses, and even horses who travel for seemingly leisurely activities such as camping, are exposed to both physical and psychological stressors.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:b0b6100a-e37e-4c1f-a104-6d61b885a483>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Signs, causes and how to manage stress in horses.\nStress is a normal physiological process that occurs in all animals, and just like it affects us humans, stress can also affect your horse.\nShort-term stress is actually an adaptive mechanism and is not always bad because it helps horses escape a threat or cope better with their environment. Basically, if horses didn’t get stressed sometimes, they would be more likely to get into tricky situations. However, the problem comes when horses are stressed for longer periods of time, without being able to get away from what is causing it. This is when stress begins to have damaging effects on your horse’s body, including reduced immunity, inhibited performance and, in particular, gastric ulcers (EGUS).\nSo, how can you tell if your horse is stressed, what are the most common causes and what can do you do to help ensure your horse’s stress levels are kept to a minimum for optimum health and performance?\nSigns of stress in horses\nWhen your horse is exposed to something than elicits a stress response, commonly known as a ‘stressor’, their body releases a hormone called cortisol which promotes behavioural and physiological changes that result in some common signs and symptoms of stress, including:\n- Vocalisation or ‘whinnying’\n- Tail Swishing\n- Reduction of appetite\n- Stereotypies e.g. crib biting or box walking\n- Flared nostrils\n- Elevated cortisol levels\n- Elevated heart rate\n- Gastric ulcers\nCauses of Stress in horses\nIf your horse shows any or a combination of these signs, then it is likely they are experiencing stress. Once you know your horse is potentially stressed, the best plan of action is to find out what is causing it and taking appropriate action to reduce stress levels.\nThere are many causes of stress linked to environment, routine and management but some of the most common ones include:\nJust as we can get stressed and fearful of performance, so can our horses. In addition, the noise, atmosphere and other horses at a competition or show are major stressors which can affect your horse. Research has shown that cortisol levels rise at competitions prior to performance in a range of disciplines and that higher or prolonged levels of stress negatively affect performance (Becker-Birk et al. 2013; Lewinski et al. 2013; Christensen et al. 2012).", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:9fd82a8d-6f3f-4dfd-9bf8-048cb73f2d23>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Equine Assisted Psychotherapy (EAP) uses horses experientially for therapy, personal development and growth.

Quiet, calm people can certainly have a positive effect on “hot” horses, helping to settle them down, but for long-term friendship, a calm horse gets along well with the same type of person. Although pairing a high energy person with a high energy horse may not be the safest combination, these matches usually do well too, especially if they are competitors.\n4. How comfortable are you around horses?\nAre you ever intimidated or afraid? What situation would make you feel unsafe, if any?\nIf you feel unsafe around horses, the best match is usually a horse that likes to take care of people and is very confident of her own ability. It always surprises me when a horse that has been donated to a handicap riding program because of bad behavior ends up as the “best horse”. Why does this happen? Because the horse was smart and confident and didn’t tolerate bad trainers who tried to make her do something she did not want to do. The same horse excelled at being able to take care of humans who value her intelligence.\nJust because a horse has more training, this does not necessarily make him a better partner for a novice. Often, horses are trained to be “bomb proof” so as not to react to scary stimuli. But they can be time bombs waiting to happen. They will not look people in the eye and have turned their awareness inward in an attempt to not show fear. They continue to hide their fear until something comes along that tips them over the edge – and then, without warning, they explode.\n5.

For your horse to feel his best, he needs time with other horses when you can’t be around.\nDo Horses Get Lonely?\nHorses actually depend on the herd for a feeling of well being. In the herd, they exist cooperatively: they stand head to tail to help keep pests away and they guard one another so that they can feel safe enough to sleep. If a horse is alone, he may never fully relax. He’ll always be the one that has to watch the horizon—constantly on guard.\nWhen horses are alone, their behaviors can change and they are often depressed. They may develop repetitive stress behaviors, such as weaving or pacing in a stall.\nWhile not all horses can always be with a herd, you can make housing and turnout choices to include his socialization needs.

At the very least, your horse will feel more comfortable if he can see other horses. If possible, make sure your horse shares a safe fence line with a neighboring horse. However, he will be most comfortable if he can touch another horse. Touching, nipping, grooming, swishing tails and even being able to bite is important to a horse’s overall well being.\nIf you are the only one your horse has, make sure to enrich his life.

These behavioral issues can occur suddenly after a traumatic experience, or can be deeply rooted in the psyche of the horse from previous experiences. Anxiety in horses is a common condition that can affect every aspect of running a horse, and affect the appearance of a horse. What causes anxiety in the horse? The anxiety will almost always have a root cause. The cause may be physical (caused by a physical factor – such as a snake or a barn door hitting) or psychological (an abusive past, or stress and separation anxiety).\nIt can also be hereditary – so it is important to determine the cause of the problem. All horses that exhibit sudden anxiety should undergo a complete checkup at the vet. Other causes of anxiety may include: * A horse in a new environment or stressful environment * Fear of other horses that share stable * Lack of a close relationship * Lack of training or experience traumatic Abuse * Remember that horses are animals to fight or run, so when put in stressful situations have a tendency to become anxious and want to ‘run’.

Many horses are uncertain about dark or enclosed places (like an indoor arena), and even more are genuinely scared of being alone (they are herd animals). Often this fear will be expressed by being buddy-sour or barn-sour, and sometimes they don’t want to go in a ring, either at home or in a competition.\n3. Sounds. Highly strung horses are easily unglued by loud, unexpected noises (a car back-firing, a garbage can falling over). Others can’t stand hissing noises (like from a leaky hose coupling), and others don’t like rustling noises (in leaves or under something). Both probably sound like a snake.\n4. Clipping or other grooming/handling. Some horses are genuinely afraid of clippers, either the sound or the sensation. Some don’t like to receive shots, and others are anxious about being shod.\n5. New places. This can be as obvious as moving to a new home or going to a competition. Or it could just be moving to a new stall or riding in a new trailer. Anxiety could even be caused by more subtle changes around the barn (the jumps were moved in the ring, for instance).\n6. Type of work/type of rider. Horses often prefer a certain type of rider. And often horses with a strong desire to please become anxious because they don’t understand what’s being asked of them, either because the exercise isn’t clear to them or the rider’s aids are confusing.\n7. Other animals. Horses are often afraid of birds, cows, goats, sheep, donkeys, deer or other wildlife. And some are afraid of other horses.\nThe only way to deal with most things that cause equine anxiety is repetition, because they're things you just can't change or that your horse just has to deal with. | Photo Courtesy of EQUUS\nRemove The Cause?\nOnce you’ve isolated the cause of your horse’s consternation, the big question is what can you do about it? And that’s where you have to be creative, confident and even willing to do an unusual thing or two.\nThe first thing to determine is the degree of your horse’s fear. Is he genuinely terrified? Can you feel his heart pounding? Is he shaking? Does he bolt blindly away?\n\nDocument 2: Carey Williams, Ph.D., Extension Specialist in Equine Management\nWhat is Stress?\nStress is the body’s response to anything it considers threatening. For a horse this could be anything, including trailering and traveling, showing, poor nutrition, feeding at irregular times, changes in other routines, environmental toxins, interactions within their social environment, variations in climate, and illness.\nSome types of stress include various physical stresses that are based on the physical makeup of the animal and its ability to respond to changes in diet, injury, etc. Psychological stresses are based on a horse’s personality and its perception of life. For example, some horses are more stressed than others by being in a stall for long periods of time.\nHow do Horses Cope with Stress?\nThe horse’s basic stress response starts with a change in behavior, either by moving away from a stimulus, swishing its tail, bucking, tensing up, etc. This stress will then cause activation of the sympathetic nervous system, called the “Fight or Flight” response. The sympathetic nervous system will create an involuntary action of the intestines (diarrhea), endocrine glands (production of adrenaline and cortisol), and heart (increase in heart rate). Next the neuroendocrine system will be activated, allowing the horse’s system to increase its energy utilization.\nEach horse deals with stress in a different way depending on their personality.\nDemonstrative, Confident Horse\n• Lets you know when it is stressed!\n• Bucks, kicks, bites, is very curious, mouthy, a troublemaker, etc.\nDemonstrative, Fearful Horse\n• Worries about everything!\n• Shies the first time it sees things and needs time to relax.\nPassive, Confident Horse\n• Usually wonders, “What’s everyone worried about?”\n• Not normally stressed, internalizes stress, shows little change even when stressed.\n• Usually is the last one in the field to take off running if something runs out of the woods.\nPassive, Fearful Horse\n• Wants to please!\n• Seems willing to do anything, but will tighten muscles and lips when stressed.\n• Won’t show fear until pushed over the limit.\nDuring exercise heat production will increase up to 50 %. This can create a problem when exercising under extremely hot and humid conditions.\n\nDocument 3: Let me say that again, it takes the RIGHT personality using the Right technique for the Right personality. In other words, the person doing the training has to be of the right frame of mind, and MUST understand, and train to, the personality of the trainee. This may be a little confusing so, as I often do, I’ll use my wife’s horse training to clarify for us humans.\nA good horse trainer will always use the first lesson to get to know the horse. Horses, like people, have distinct personalities. Unlike people, horses are big and strong and can hurt you if you push the wrong buttons. Because we respect their size and our ultimate goal is to produce a good horse, we pay attention to who we are dealing with and train accordingly. Some will respond to training like second nature and some require warm up and praise to build confidence just to leave the stall. And the sooner you begin to understand the horse, the sooner the real training can begin.\nWhen it comes to personality, horses, like people, can generally be grouped in to four categories or styles:\n• Challenging; Prideful, Territorial, Strong Sense of Self.\n• Social; “Official Greeter”, Interactive, Easy to train.\n• Fearful; Guarded, cautious, looks to another horse or a person for strength.\n• Aloof; Independent, Delayed or Dull responses, Tends to ignore commands.\nOur Challenging horse was Faith. Faith would meet you head on in the round pen but once she understood you were serious, would perform better than her peers to prove her superiority. In the alternative, our Social horse Miss Fitz will go along with just about anything we ask her to do as long as she is getting the attention. We might use different adjectives to describe people personalities but you get the idea. Each personality has specific preferences and tendencies that we look for and use in our training techniques. Each has its advantages and challenges but understanding the horse allows us to set expectation and get the most we can out of a session and, ultimately, out of the horse. This applies to our people too!\nSo how does this change our approach to training?\n\nDocument 4: When a horse is being trained,\nanalysis of the horses character type must be sought before instructions\nare put forth for training/teaching.\nWhat is your horses type?\nLazy - stubborn\nFighter - fight\nNervous - flight\nWilling - bargainer\nLazy horses can become\nchums with you very easily and the person may think that the training is\ngoing to be a breeze.

How individual horses respond to potentially stressful situations differs, but many health ailments are originated from stress of one kind or another.\nStress can be defined as a general term which describes the combination of psychological and biological responses of an animal during real or perceived threatening circumstances. While the physiological response to stress is a highly complex subject, and certainly is not completely understood, scientists agree that there are two types of stressors.\nPhysical stressors are things such as injury, over-exertion or a change in the environment. Psychological stressors typically include situations that make the animal anxious or fearful. Uncertainty and fear of the unknown can be categorized as two of the major psychological stressors. Competing horses, and even horses who travel for seemingly leisurely activities such as camping, are exposed to both physical and psychological stressors.\n\nDocument 6: Can be loner, bad communicator, possessive, hedonistic, self-doubting, distrustful, mendacious, suffocating, cold.\n7.

It is experiential in nature. You learn about yourself through engaging in activities, on the ground, with the horses and through reflecting and discussing feelings and behaviours you experienced. It is a powerful therapeutic approach that has limitless opportunities to foster awareness, healing and growth.\nWe offer experiential learning and supportive care for individuals, couples and families who encounter anxiety, stress, depression or who need help navigating family dynamics, parenting or relationships.

We are EAGALA certified and ready to work with you!\nHorses are large, majestic and powerful animals who many find intimidating due to their sheer size. Horses are very present. They are in the moment. They are curious, honest animals and they give real feedback because they mirror your emotions. What you bring in you will see through them.\nThey also are prey animals which means they’re very attuned to the environment that they’re in and they react quickly to what’s happening around them. Horses respond almost immediately to what we bring to the space. Horses don’t worry about being polite. They respond to your reactions very honestly.\nFor example if you’re feeling scared, the horse doesn't’t take it personally but they are going to react to it. They will feed off it. They will mirror your fear. A horse won’t care if you come in and you’ve had a bad day.They are going to react honestly and clearly to what you bring to them. Their feedback is important information for us. It can help us become aware of our blind spots in our life and offer ways to move beyond what limits us.\n\nDocument 11: Skip to content\n- Horses have the ability to elicit strong feelings and emotional in people. They provide the opportunity to explore these feelings/emotions when they arise. Emotions such as fear, anxiety, panic, sadness, grief, anger, rage, happiness and joy may be evoked when being around the horses.\n- Horses also model awareness and safety and survival .\n- Horses offer unique feedback to how clients behave around them.\n- Horses are very sensitive to people’s behaviour and respond differently to subtle changes in an individual’s mood and/or behaviour.\n- Horses model relationships through their interactions with one another.\n\nDocument 12: Signs, causes and how to manage stress in horses.\nStress is a normal physiological process that occurs in all animals, and just like it affects us humans, stress can also affect your horse.\nShort-term stress is actually an adaptive mechanism and is not always bad because it helps horses escape a threat or cope better with their environment. Basically, if horses didn’t get stressed sometimes, they would be more likely to get into tricky situations. However, the problem comes when horses are stressed for longer periods of time, without being able to get away from what is causing it. This is when stress begins to have damaging effects on your horse’s body, including reduced immunity, inhibited performance and, in particular, gastric ulcers (EGUS).\nSo, how can you tell if your horse is stressed, what are the most common causes and what can do you do to help ensure your horse’s stress levels are kept to a minimum for optimum health and performance?\nSigns of stress in horses\nWhen your horse is exposed to something than elicits a stress response, commonly known as a ‘stressor’, their body releases a hormone called cortisol which promotes behavioural and physiological changes that result in some common signs and symptoms of stress, including:\n- Vocalisation or ‘whinnying’\n- Tail Swishing\n- Reduction of appetite\n- Stereotypies e.g. crib biting or box walking\n- Flared nostrils\n- Elevated cortisol levels\n- Elevated heart rate\n- Gastric ulcers\nCauses of Stress in horses\nIf your horse shows any or a combination of these signs, then it is likely they are experiencing stress. Once you know your horse is potentially stressed, the best plan of action is to find out what is causing it and taking appropriate action to reduce stress levels.\nThere are many causes of stress linked to environment, routine and management but some of the most common ones include:\nJust as we can get stressed and fearful of performance, so can our horses. In addition, the noise, atmosphere and other horses at a competition or show are major stressors which can affect your horse. Research has shown that cortisol levels rise at competitions prior to performance in a range of disciplines and that higher or prolonged levels of stress negatively affect performance (Becker-Birk et al. 2013; Lewinski et al. 2013; Christensen et al. 2012).\n\nDocument 13: Do you feel comfortable with creatures that think for themselves and are confident about their actions? Or do you prefer shy, gentle beings that depend on others for guidance? Think about your own personality and how others would describe you. Because both horses and humans are social mammals, we match up best with similar temperaments. In other words, “like attracts like”. Quiet, calm people can certainly have a positive effect on “hot” horses, helping to settle them down, but for long-term friendship, a calm horse gets along well with the same type of person. Although pairing a high energy person with a high energy horse may not be the safest combination, these matches usually do well too, especially if they are competitors.\n4. How comfortable are you around horses?\nAre you ever intimidated or afraid? What situation would make you feel unsafe, if any?\nIf you feel unsafe around horses, the best match is usually a horse that likes to take care of people and is very confident of her own ability. It always surprises me when a horse that has been donated to a handicap riding program because of bad behavior ends up as the “best horse”. Why does this happen? Because the horse was smart and confident and didn’t tolerate bad trainers who tried to make her do something she did not want to do. The same horse excelled at being able to take care of humans who value her intelligence.\nJust because a horse has more training, this does not necessarily make him a better partner for a novice. Often, horses are trained to be “bomb proof” so as not to react to scary stimuli. But they can be time bombs waiting to happen. They will not look people in the eye and have turned their awareness inward in an attempt to not show fear. They continue to hide their fear until something comes along that tips them over the edge – and then, without warning, they explode.\n5. What qualities are you seeking in the horse – conformation, gait, breed, color, education, experience?\nPrioritize these qualities from most to least important. You may not be able to find the perfect horse to meet your budget, so highlighting the top three qualities is helpful.\n6. What physical limitations can you accept?\nThere are no perfect horses, just as there are no perfect people. Physical handicaps can be the result of poor conformation, injury and/or stress, lack of proper conditioning, poor rider balance or bad training.\n\nDocument 14: Do you want your horse to be happy, relaxed and ready for your next ride? For your horse to feel his best, he needs time with other horses when you can’t be around.\nDo Horses Get Lonely?\nHorses actually depend on the herd for a feeling of well being. In the herd, they exist cooperatively: they stand head to tail to help keep pests away and they guard one another so that they can feel safe enough to sleep. If a horse is alone, he may never fully relax. He’ll always be the one that has to watch the horizon—constantly on guard.\nWhen horses are alone, their behaviors can change and they are often depressed. They may develop repetitive stress behaviors, such as weaving or pacing in a stall.\nWhile not all horses can always be with a herd, you can make housing and turnout choices to include his socialization needs. If you have a small property, a performance horse that needs to be kept safe, or a horse with health or behavior issues, you may need to keep him alone for part of the day. That’s OK, as long as you do your best to provide natural elements.\nA horse would rather be with other horses. How Mustangs live in the wild is what your horse would choose for himself. A horse wants wide-open spaces so that at any moment he can flee from a predator. While humans think that a small, warm space with high walls is comforting, horses are comforted by seeing the horizon and accessing open spaces. Your horse wants turnout time outside with other horses. It’s time to think like a horse and think about how your horse wants to live.\nHorses Home Alone\nIf you have an only horse, I think you have a responsibility to provide some form of 24-hour-a-day companionship. At the very least, your horse will feel more comfortable if he can see other horses. If possible, make sure your horse shares a safe fence line with a neighboring horse. However, he will be most comfortable if he can touch another horse. Touching, nipping, grooming, swishing tails and even being able to bite is important to a horse’s overall well being.\nIf you are the only one your horse has, make sure to enrich his life. In addition to riding, stimulate his mind and occupy his time with long walks. You may also give him obstacles and novel items to interact with in his paddock.\n\nDocument 15: The horses, as well as humans and pets tend to have a variety of behavioral problems. These behavioral issues can occur suddenly after a traumatic experience, or can be deeply rooted in the psyche of the horse from previous experiences. Anxiety in horses is a common condition that can affect every aspect of running a horse, and affect the appearance of a horse. What causes anxiety in the horse? The anxiety will almost always have a root cause. The cause may be physical (caused by a physical factor – such as a snake or a barn door hitting) or psychological (an abusive past, or stress and separation anxiety).\nIt can also be hereditary – so it is important to determine the cause of the problem. All horses that exhibit sudden anxiety should undergo a complete checkup at the vet. Other causes of anxiety may include: * A horse in a new environment or stressful environment * Fear of other horses that share stable * Lack of a close relationship * Lack of training or experience traumatic Abuse * Remember that horses are animals to fight or run, so when put in stressful situations have a tendency to become anxious and want to ‘run’. Some horses will be less nervous than others because of how they manage stress. Also, always check the physical things that can cause anxiety – such as a barn door knocking, firecrackers in a neighboring field, etc. . Diagnosis of anxiety horse Because varying degrees of anxiety, it is important to know your horse and watch for physical and behavioral changes.\n* Hiding in the corner of the barn’s eyes widen * * * Restlessness or tremor twitching jogging step forward and backwards * Rearing * Sleep disturbances * Loss of appetite-related physical conditions include include: Constipation or stomach upset * * * Riots Colico eczema or skin and Hair Loss Help Many horse’s anxiety medications to help with nervousness, excessive anxiety or stress in horses. Unfortunately these medications are not without side effects, and while they may help relax the horse long-term effects are unknown. In addition, the sedative and painkilling drugs can numb your senses of a horse – can do competitive events as well as training more difficult because it requires concentration and vigilance. Talk to your vet about other alternatives. Many natural remedies while still maintaining the horse alert. The homeopathic ingredients such as Cham, Kali. have traditionally been used for centuries. And promoting the appropriate levels of salts in living cells necessary for the physical and mental health.\n\nQuestion: What are the different personality types of horses and how do they respond to stress?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Horses exhibit a range of personality types, which influence their responses to stress. They can generally be categorized into four personality styles: Challenging, Social, Fearful, and Aloof. Each type has distinct characteristics and reactions to stress.\n\nChallenging horses, like Faith, may respond to stress by asserting dominance or proving their superiority, as they have a strong sense of self. Social horses, such as Miss Fitz, tend to be agreeable and may cope with stress by seeking attention and approval. Fearful horses are cautious and may become anxious in new situations, looking to others for reassurance. Aloof horses, on the other hand, are independent and may internalize stress, showing little outward reaction.\n\nStress can be physical or psychological, affecting horses in various ways depending on their personality. Common signs of stress in horses, such as vocalization, tail swishing, and reduced appetite, can vary based on individual personality types. Horses are sensitive to people's behavior and respond honestly to emotions, which can influence their stress levels. They are also attuned to their environment and react quickly to changes, which can be a source of stress.\n\nUnderstanding these personality types is crucial for managing stress effectively and ensuring the well-being of horses. By recognizing the unique behaviors and coping mechanisms of each type, horse owners and caretakers can tailor their approaches to reduce stress and promote a healthy environment for their horses.\n\nIn summary, horses' personality types significantly impact their stress responses, with each type exhibiting unique behaviors and coping mechanisms. This understanding is essential for effective stress management and the overall welfare of horses."}

In the lungs, the mucus clogs the airways and traps bacteria leading to infections, extensive lung damage, and eventually, respiratory failure. In the pancreas, the mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that allow the body to break down food and absorb vital nutrients.\nSymptoms of CF\nPeople with CF can have a variety of symptoms, including:\n- Very salty-tasting skin\n- Persistent coughing, at times with phlegm\n- Frequent lung infections including pneumonia or bronchitis\n- Wheezing or shortness of breath\n- Poor growth or weight gain\n- Frequent greasy, bulky stools or difficulty with bowel movements\n- Male infertility\nDiagnosis and Genetics\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease. People with CF have inherited two copies of the defective CF gene — one copy from each parent.\nPeople with only one copy of the defective CF gene are called carriers, but they do not have the disease. Each time two CF carriers have a child, the chances are:\n- 25 percent (1 in 4) the child will have CF\n- 50 percent (1 in 2) the child will be a carrier but will not have CF\n- 25 percent (1 in 4) the child will not be a carrier and will not have CF\nThe defective CF gene contains an abnormality called a mutation. There are more than 2000 known mutations of the disease. Most genetic tests only screen for the most common CF mutations.

This Genetic Disease Affects Every System In the Body\nThe life-threatening disorder causes shortness of breath, a persistent cough, and digestion issues.\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex, life-threatening disease that affects many organs in the body, including the lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. It’s caused by a genetic mutation that causes a certain protein to stop working. When this happens, chloride—a mineral that’s vital to cellular hydration—can’t move to the surface of cells, prompting mucus to become thick and sticky in a variety of organs.\n“The predominant way CF affects the body is in the gastrointestinal and respiratory system, but it causes a wide variety of complications that affects every system in the body,” Zubin Mukadam, MD, assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care at Wayne State University and Detroit Medical Center, tells Health.\nIn the lungs of a CF patient, mucus becomes clogged in the airways and bacteria and other germs can get trapped. In the pancreas, mucus buildup prevents the release of digestive enzymes that help the body absorb food and nutrients, resulting in malnutrition. In the liver, thick mucus can block the bile duct, causing liver disease. And in men, CF can affect the ability to have children, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\nRELATED: Signs and Symptoms of Pneumonia\n“When a channel to certain organs, specifically the lungs, become dehydrated, this can lead to chronic inflammation and chronic infection,” Don Hayes, Jr., MD, medical director of lung and heart-lung transplant programs for Nationwide Children’s Hospital and The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Health. “This is why CF is a progressive disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time.”\nCystic fibrosis and the family tree\nMore than 30,000 people are living with CF in the United States, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and more than 75% are diagnosed by age 2.\n“We do a lot of newborn screening,” says Dr. Mukadam.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:0fd62641-1884-45c1-becb-5c0f88874e2c>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "What is cystic fibrosis?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease. A child with CF has a faulty gene that affects the movement of sodium chloride (salt) in and out of certain cells.\nThe result is thick, heavy, sticky mucus; salty sweat; and thickened digestive juices. The thick mucus secretions can clog the lungs, making a child with CF very prone to breathing difficulties, lung infections (the mucus provides a rich environment for bacteria), and, eventually, severe lung damage. And when thickened digestive fluids from the child's pancreas can't get to the small intestine to break down and absorb nutrients from the food he eats, he may also have digestive and growth problems.\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis in children?\nPoor growth is one of the first signs of CF. Parents may also notice a nagging cough and wheezing. Coughing and wheezing are hardly unique to children with CF, of course. These symptoms could be caused by viral bronchiolitis (an inflammation of the small breathing tubes), asthma, or even a dusty, smoky environment. Each of these conditions is far more common than any genetic disease.\nStill, cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening genetic disease among people of Northern European descent. Other symptoms include salty skin, a big appetite with no weight gain, and large, greasy stools.\nSometimes the condition doesn't become apparent until a child has had a series of repeated lung infections or severe growth problems. If your child has any of these symptoms, talk with her doctor.\nCystic fibrosis can't be cured, but there are new treatments that can not only prolong a child's life but may also help make that life more normal.

In the lungs, the mucus clogs the airways and traps bacteria leading to infections, extensive lung damage, and eventually, respiratory failure. In the pancreas, the mucus prevents the release of digestive enzymes that allow the body to break down food and absorb vital nutrients.\nSymptoms of CF\nPeople with CF can have a variety of symptoms, including:\n- Very salty-tasting skin\n- Persistent coughing, at times with phlegm\n- Frequent lung infections including pneumonia or bronchitis\n- Wheezing or shortness of breath\n- Poor growth or weight gain\n- Frequent greasy, bulky stools or difficulty with bowel movements\n- Male infertility\nDiagnosis and Genetics\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease. People with CF have inherited two copies of the defective CF gene — one copy from each parent.\nPeople with only one copy of the defective CF gene are called carriers, but they do not have the disease. Each time two CF carriers have a child, the chances are:\n- 25 percent (1 in 4) the child will have CF\n- 50 percent (1 in 2) the child will be a carrier but will not have CF\n- 25 percent (1 in 4) the child will not be a carrier and will not have CF\nThe defective CF gene contains an abnormality called a mutation. There are more than 2000 known mutations of the disease. Most genetic tests only screen for the most common CF mutations. Read more about diagnosis.\nAccording to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry, in the United States:\n- More than 30,000 people are living with cystic fibrosis (more than 70,000 worldwide).\n- Approximately 1,000 new cases of CF are diagnosed each year.\n- More than 75 percent of people with CF are diagnosed by age 2.\n- More than half of the CF population is age 18 or older.\n\nDocument 2: For patients who have cystic fibrosis, it’s important to understand that this medical condition is inherited and it causes serious damages to the digestive system and lungs. Besides, it affects those cells that produce sweat, mucus, and digestive juices, which are the fluids that are slippery and thin normally.\n\nDocument 3: What Is Cystic Fibrosis? This Genetic Disease Affects Every System In the Body\nThe life-threatening disorder causes shortness of breath, a persistent cough, and digestion issues.\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex, life-threatening disease that affects many organs in the body, including the lungs, kidneys, and gastrointestinal tract. It’s caused by a genetic mutation that causes a certain protein to stop working. When this happens, chloride—a mineral that’s vital to cellular hydration—can’t move to the surface of cells, prompting mucus to become thick and sticky in a variety of organs.\n“The predominant way CF affects the body is in the gastrointestinal and respiratory system, but it causes a wide variety of complications that affects every system in the body,” Zubin Mukadam, MD, assistant professor of pulmonary and critical care at Wayne State University and Detroit Medical Center, tells Health.\nIn the lungs of a CF patient, mucus becomes clogged in the airways and bacteria and other germs can get trapped. In the pancreas, mucus buildup prevents the release of digestive enzymes that help the body absorb food and nutrients, resulting in malnutrition. In the liver, thick mucus can block the bile duct, causing liver disease. And in men, CF can affect the ability to have children, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.\nRELATED: Signs and Symptoms of Pneumonia\n“When a channel to certain organs, specifically the lungs, become dehydrated, this can lead to chronic inflammation and chronic infection,” Don Hayes, Jr., MD, medical director of lung and heart-lung transplant programs for Nationwide Children’s Hospital and The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells Health. “This is why CF is a progressive disease that causes persistent lung infections and limits the ability to breathe over time.”\nCystic fibrosis and the family tree\nMore than 30,000 people are living with CF in the United States, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and more than 75% are diagnosed by age 2.\n“We do a lot of newborn screening,” says Dr. Mukadam.\n\nDocument 4: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic genetic condition involving multiple organ systems. Classical CF primarily involves the respiratory and digestive systems, and may have a range of clinical severity. Pulmonary symptoms often include lower airway inflammation, chronic cough, chronic sinusitis, and recurrent infections. Digestive symptoms often include meconium ileus, pancreatic insufficiency resulting in malabsorption and/or failure to thrive, diabetes mellitus, and hepatobiliary disease. Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) is seen in men without pulmonary or digestive symptoms of CF, and results in azoospermia . CBAVD is a significant cause of male infertility.\nCF is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Individuals with mutations in the CFTR gene may also present with milder or atypical symptoms such as pancreatitis or chronic sinusitis.\nThe incidence of CF is approximately 1 in 2500 live births among Caucasians and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The carrier frequency is estimated to be approximately 1 in 25 in the Caucasian population, 1 in 24 in the Ashkenazi Jewish population, 1 in 61 in the African American population, 1 in 58 in the Hispanic population and 1 in 94 in the Asian population.\nThe current recommendation from the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists [2, 3] and the American College of Medical Genetics Subcommittee on Cystic Fibrosis  is that screening for cystic fibrosis be offered to all patients, regardless of ethnicity, by a minimum panel of 23 common mutations .\nThis test offers an expanded panel of 142 mutations to account for mutations more common in non-Caucasian ethnic groups, as well as rarer mutations across all ethnic groups.\nClick here for a complete list of CFTR mutations.\nFor those providers wishing to order only the ACOG/ACMG recommended 39-mutation panel, see test code CF.\nVisit www.ThinkGenetic.com for patient-friendly information on cystic fibrosis.\n1.

ACOG Committee Opinion.\n\nDocument 5: What is cystic fibrosis?\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease. A child with CF has a faulty gene that affects the movement of sodium chloride (salt) in and out of certain cells.\nThe result is thick, heavy, sticky mucus; salty sweat; and thickened digestive juices. The thick mucus secretions can clog the lungs, making a child with CF very prone to breathing difficulties, lung infections (the mucus provides a rich environment for bacteria), and, eventually, severe lung damage. And when thickened digestive fluids from the child's pancreas can't get to the small intestine to break down and absorb nutrients from the food he eats, he may also have digestive and growth problems.\nWhat are the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis in children?\nPoor growth is one of the first signs of CF. Parents may also notice a nagging cough and wheezing. Coughing and wheezing are hardly unique to children with CF, of course. These symptoms could be caused by viral bronchiolitis (an inflammation of the small breathing tubes), asthma, or even a dusty, smoky environment. Each of these conditions is far more common than any genetic disease.\nStill, cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening genetic disease among people of Northern European descent. Other symptoms include salty skin, a big appetite with no weight gain, and large, greasy stools.\nSometimes the condition doesn't become apparent until a child has had a series of repeated lung infections or severe growth problems. If your child has any of these symptoms, talk with her doctor.\nCystic fibrosis can't be cured, but there are new treatments that can not only prolong a child's life but may also help make that life more normal. And the earlier cystic fibrosis is diagnosed, the more effective those therapies will be.\nHow common is cystic fibrosis?\nThe chances of your child having CF are about 1 in 3,000 if your child is Caucasian, 1 in 9,000 if he's Hispanic, 1 in 11,000 if he's Native American, 1 in 15,000 if he's of African heritage, and 1 in 30,000 if he's Asian American.\nChildren get cystic fibrosis when they inherit one defective CF gene from their mother and another from their father.\n\nDocument 6: Cystic fibrosis is an inherited sickness that creates serious injury to the lungs, digestive system, and other organs in the body. Cystic fibrosis targets the cells that generate mucus, sweat, and digestive juices. These secreted fluids are usually thin and slippery. In people with cystic fibrosis, a dispute gene makes the secretions to become sticky and thick. In spite of working as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts, and passageways, specifically in the lungs and pancreas. Although cystic fibrosis needs regular care, people with the situation are generally able to join school and work, and sometimes have a better quality of life than people with cystic fibrosis had in earlier decades. Improvements in screening and treatments mean people suffering from cystic fibrosis now may live in their mid- the too late 30s, on average, and some are living in between 40s and 50s.\nSymptoms of Cystic Fibrosis\nScreening of newborns for cystic fibrosis symptoms is now done in each state in the United States. As a result, the situation can be diagnosed within the first month of life, before symptoms of cystic fibrosis promote. For people born before newborn screening was done, it is significant to be conscious of the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis.\nCystic fibrosis symptoms differ, based on the depth of the disease. Even in the same person, symptoms of cystic fibrosis may worsen or improve as time passes. Some people may not feel symptoms until adulthood.\nPeople with cystic fibrosis have a higher than usual level of salt in their sweat. Parents sometimes can taste salty when they kiss their children. Most of the other signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis target the respiratory system and the digestive system. However, adults diagnosed with cystic fibrosis are more likely to have atypical symptoms, like recurring bouts of pancreatitis, infertility and recurring pneumonia disease.\nCystic Fibrosis Causes\nCauses of cystic fibrosis, a fault in a gene changes a protein that circulates the movement of salt in and out of cells. The outcome is thick, sticky mucus in the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems, as well as developed salt in sweat. Many various disputes can happen in the gene. The type of gene mutation is related to the severity of the situation.\n\nDocument 7: What is Cystic Fibrosis?\nCystic Fibrosis is a genetic disorder that causes severe damage and infection to the lungs, gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands. It is a condition that affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat and digestive juice. Usually, the mucus is thin and slippery, but due to the condition of Cystic Fibrosis, the mucus becomes thick and sticky.\nThe thick mucus results in trouble breathing as the mucus blocks the airways. Over time the mucus fills inside the airways leading to the cause of infection.\nWhat causes Cystic Fibrosis?\nCystic Fibrosis disorder occurs because of a defect in the gene. It is hereditary. The defect or mutation in CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene causes Cystic Fibrosis. The defective genes affect the cells producing mucus, thus, making them thick and sticky.\nWhat are the symptoms of Cystic Fibrosis?\nThe symptoms always vary with the severity of the disorder. Pay attention to the following symptoms:\n- Trouble breathing\n- Frequent lung infections\n- Blockage in the nasal passage\n- Sinus infection\n- Persistent coughing\n- Constipation or Diarrhoea\nHow is Cystic Fibrosis diagnosed?\nThe Cystic Fibrosis diagnosis method uses different tests that include the following.\nIn newborns, the CF is diagnosed through newborn screening so that treatment can begin immediately. Sweat tests and blood tests are the two tests to check for Cystic Fibrosis in newborn children.\nA blood test helps to check the immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT). People affected with Cystic Fibrosis have a high level of IRT.\nSweat tests can also determine whether the individual has Cystic Fibrosis. It helps to measure the salt in sweat. The sweat test is the commonly used test to diagnose Cystic Fibrosis. In people with Cystic Fibrosis, the rate of salt in the body is higher than normal.\nA genetic test is carried out to check the genes that cause Cystic Fibrosis. Blood samples will be collected and sent for further examination to check for Cystic Fibrosis. A genetic test can also be performed to check for the mutations in the CFTR genes.\nWhat are the treatments for Cystic Fibrosis?\nThere is no cure for Cystic Fibrosis.\n\nDocument 8: What does Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Mean For People?\nCystic Fibrosis is the UK’s most common life-threatening inherited disease. It is caused by a defective gene that clogs the internal organs, especially the lungs and digestive system, with thick sticky mucus resulting in chromic infections and inflammation in the lungs and difficulty digesting food. Over 7500 people in the UK are living with the disease, 5 babies are born with it each week. One person in 25 carries the faulty gene, and if 2 carriers have a baby, the child has a 1 in 4 chance of having CF.\nHow is the Future Getting Brighter?\nDecades ago, the majority of children born with the disease were not expected to live beyond infancy. Now the average life expectancy is 36 and rising steadily. For the past two years, most parts of the UK now have more adults than children with CF.\nPhysiological Society Member Alastair Innes from the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh says “I run an adult CF clinic and we have several patients over the age of 50. About 70% of our adults with CF are in employment or education. We’ve achieved this through helping our patients with better nutrition, physiotherapy, the aggressive use of antibiotics, the development of multi-disciplinary team care, new high tech treatments and lung transplantation.\nHowever the battle isn’t over yet. This progress carries a heavy burden of life long treatments and hospital supervision, with some patients, despite the best care, still dying in childhood. Most other patients still don’t live beyond middle age in a society where most people can expect to live into their 70s or even longer. Further research is vital and now offers the prospect of greatly improved treatments coming on line in the next few years”.\nResearch progress has been staggering since the gene responsible was identified in 1989, and Physiological Society members have made important contributions to this work. For instance the first ever measurements of the action of the CF gene product, called CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator) were made in Newcastle by Mike Gray and Barry Argent using electrical measurements on human epithelial cells.\nPhysiologists helped show that the main role of CFTR is to control salt and fluid transport in epithelial cells and this process is reduced in CF tissue, where CFTR is faulty. This is probably the basic defect in CF.\n\nDocument 9: - Patient Comments: Cystic Fibrosis - Describe Your Experience\n- Patient Comments: Cystic Fibrosis - Symptoms\n- Patient Comments: Cystic Fibrosis - Risk\n- Cystic fibrosis facts*\n- What is cystic fibrosis?\n- What are other names for cystic fibrosis?\n- What causes cystic fibrosis?\n- Is cystic fibrosis inherited?\n- Who is at risk for cystic fibrosis?\n- What are the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis?\n- How is cystic fibrosis diagnosed?\n- How is cystic fibrosis treated?\n- Living with cystic fibrosis\n- What is the outlook for cystic fibrosis?\nWhat is the outlook for cystic fibrosis?\nThe symptoms and severity of CF vary. If you or your child has the disease, you may have serious lung and digestive problems. If the disease is mild, symptoms may not show up until the teen or adult years.\nThe symptoms and severity of CF also vary over time. Sometimes you'll have few symptoms. Other times, your symptoms may become more severe. As the disease gets worse, you'll have more severe symptoms more often.\nLung function often starts to decline in early childhood in people who have CF. Over time, damage to the lungs can cause severe breathing problems. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death in people who have CF.\nAs treatments for CF continue to improve, so does life expectancy for those who have the disease. Today, some people who have CF are living into their forties or fifties, or longer.\nEarly treatment for CF can improve your quality of life and increase your lifespan. Treatments may include nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, exercise, and other treatments.\nYour doctor also may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). PR is a broad program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems.\nMedically reviewed by James E Gerace, MD; American Board of Internal Medicine with subspecialty in Pulmonary Disease\n\"Cystic Fibrosis.\" NIH National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. 1 June 2011.\n\nDocument 10: Symptoms Cystic fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that affects cells that secrete mucus, sweat, and digestive juices.\nIn normal cases, the fluid being secreted is thin and slippery, but in the case of cystic, a defective gene causes the secretions to become thick and sticky.\nSo, instead of these moisturizing secretions, they block the tubes, ducts and pathways, especially in the lungs and pancreas.\nSymptoms of cystic fibrosis\nCystic fibrosis symptoms and symptoms vary, depending on the severity of the disease, symptoms may improve or worsen over time in the same person.\nIn some children, symptoms begin to appear during infancy and others may not experience symptoms until adolescence or puberty.\nSalt in sweat is usually higher than normal in cystic .\nParents often feel the salt taste when kissing their children.\nMost signs of cystic and other symptoms affect the respiratory system or the digestive system.\nSigns and symptoms of respiratory\nThe thick, viscous mucus associated with cystic fibrosis blocks the ducts that carry air from and to the lungs.

In other words, the most common cause of the disease is the mutation of the gene from both parents.\n- Although it varies according to the affected organ, it may present with many findings.\n- In early infancy, recurrent and treatment-resistant lower respiratory tract infections, cough, wheezing may occur.\n- Patients may have difficulty in gaining weight, oily, smelly and frequent defecation, growth and developmental retardation.\n- When they are kissed by their mother, it may be felt that they have excessive salty sweat.\n- They may apply with loss of liquid and salt, weakness, loss of appetite and exhaustion, especially in hot weather.\n- In older children, symptoms may include excessive sputum production, frequent lung infection, enlargement of the fingertips (clubbing), nasal polyps, recurrent attacks of sinusitis.\n- Rarely, it may present with findings such as diabetes.\n- Adulthood, delayed puberty, pancreatitis attacks, hepatic and pancreatic insufficiency can be seen in adulthood.\nHow is Cystic Fibrosis Diagnosed?\nComplaints such as symptoms of cystic fibrosis can also be varied. Anaemia, elevation in liver function tests, impaired chlorine values and changes in blood gas, pulmonary as well as chest film findings are among the methods used for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. The exact diagnosis is made by the presence of chlorine elevation in the sweat test. Values taken as a result of this test of 60 and above mean cystic fibrosis. At the same time, the cystic fibrosis gene mutation analysis structures can be determined by the type of mutation in which the disease occurs.\nHow is Cystic Fibrosis Treated?\nCystic fibrosis is treated with a combination of medication, physical therapy and exercise.\nDrug: There are three main drugs used in the treatment of Cystic Fibrosis.\nBronchodilator drugs that keep the airway open, antibiotics fighting infections, steroids to alleviate inflammation. To help digestion, patients with Cystic Fibrosis need to take pancreatic enzymes with each meal.\nPhysiotherapy: Daily physical therapy is inevitable for clearing the mucus layer in the airways and minimizing infection. This physiotherapy can be administered by the parent or caregiver at home. When children are old enough, they can apply the necessary daily therapies themselves.\n\nDocument 14: Cystic Fibrosis.

(Source)\nNot all rooms in your home may have such a piece of furniture, so we’ll provide some basic guidelines to help you determine the best and worst places to seek shelter depending on the room you’re in when an earthquake begins.\nStay Inside Your Apartment\nAs scary as it may seem, try to stay inside of your home during the earthquake where it’s safer. Modern apartments are designed to withstand earthquakes, and the chances of them collapsing are very small.\nThe earthquake that struck Japan in 2011 was a 9.1 magnitude earthquake, and the strongest recorded in the country’s history. Of the 13,135 known casualties, over 90% of them were a result of drowning from the tsunami, and around 4% were caused by injuries from being crushed. (Source)\nAs we mentioned before, the safest spot is under something sturdy, because you’re more likely to be injured or killed by debris. Parts of the exterior of the apartment, such as the walls and the roof, could collapse onto you if you were to run outside during the earthquake.\nStay in Your Bed If You’re Already There\nIf you wake up to an earthquake in the middle of the night, stay in your bed as long as you’re not in any danger of tall furniture falling on you such as bookcases. Use your pillow to protect your face and neck until the shaking stops. If there is a window or any glass nearby, cover your body with a blanket to help keep it safe.\nSee also our article: What To Do During An Earthquake In A Tall Building\nPlaces in Your Apartment to Avoid\nNow that you know where you should stay in your apartment, we’ll explain some of the places you should avoid and why.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:df291838-5557-450a-9f0d-cd17568cd1b2>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Dangerous Spots in an Apartment\n- Near windows\n- Near tall furniture (shelves, bookcases, etc.)\n- Near cabinets\n- Inside doorways\n- Narrow spaces (closets, bathrooms, etc.)\nWindows and Other Glass\nWindows and other forms of glass are very likely to shatter during an earthquake. Your first priority should be to get away from any windows in your apartment as quickly as possible. If you take shelter under furniture that is near a window, try to face away from it in case it breaks.\nMake sure to keep your eyes closed as you take cover, to prevent any broken glass from entering them. After the earthquake ends, be careful not to step on any shards of glass that may be on the floor.\nMany injuries during an earthquake are a result of furniture collapsing on victims. If you cannot get under a sturdy piece of furniture, avoid any open spaces where bookshelves, TV stands, mirrors, etc. could fall on you. As a precautionary measure, you should consider rearranging any rooms that may have multiple pieces of tall furniture in them so you can create a safer space if they were to collapse.\nThe kitchen is one of the most dangerous places to be, because dishes, pots, and pans can fall from the shelves and cabinets. If you are in the kitchen when an earthquake begins, get under your kitchen table. If you don’t have a table, then try to crawl out of the kitchen as quickly as possible.\nAlso, get away from the stove if you are cooking. Anything on the stove could fall over and burn you. Most stoves in Japan are designed to automatically turn off during an earthquake, so do not go near it in an attempt to shut it down. Don’t panic if hot food starts to spill across the floor. Continue to crawl away to a safer location where it can’t reach you.\nMany people believe that doorways are a safe place to stand during an earthquake, but this is simply not true. The door could swing and injure you if you are near it and it is left open. Many door frames are constructed from wood, and these have a tendency to become stuck due to damage from the shaking.\nAs a precaution, take note of which doors in your apartment have a wooden frame versus a metal frame.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:df291838-5557-450a-9f0d-cd17568cd1b2>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "Restraining suspended ceilings\nNew Zealand buildings commonly use two types of suspended ceiling – perimeter fixed and floating.\nVertical restraint is often provided by the force due to gravity on the suspended ceiling itself.

This is typically achieved with a channel moulding or proprietary fixing.\nA common cause of damage to perimeter-fixed ceilings in Christchurch was inadequate fixing of the ceiling perimeter to the wall. This was particularly due to undersized or insufficient rivets to connect the grid members to the wall support.\nIf perimeter fixing is insufficient for the seismic demand, the ceiling must be braced to the structure using another method. Floating ceilings are suspended using vertical hangers and braced to the underside of the floor above to provide lateral restraint. They are not connected to the perimeter wall or frame. The gap between the ceiling and the surrounding wall has to be sufficiently large that the ceiling is not damaged by impacts against the wall during an earthquake.\nVertical suspension may be provided using wire or cable hangers, or vertical struts constructed from angles, metal studs or proprietary compression posts anchored to the ceiling grid and the building structure.\nLateral bracing in a floating ceiling can be provided by using rigid braces, cable braces (splay wires) combined with vertical struts, or a combination of these techniques. In each case, the seismic braces should be designed to enable the suspended ceiling to carry the seismic demand load .\nRigid braces should be installed in pairs orthogonal to each other and in combination with a vertical hanger or strut.

Even outside of such zones it is possible to experience events that can cause an aquarium to plummet to the floor, such as strong winds that come with hurricanes and tornadoes. Even a mild quake can knock things over, including aquariums, unless they are solidly secured in such a way that they are unlikely to fall. While a large earthquake could still send the aquarium crashing, the chances of it staying in place are much better if you take some precautions.\nTo protect fish in the event of an earthquake, avoid having heavy rocks or other decorations stacked up in such a way that they could easily fall during moderate shaking. Heavy items can crush fish if they fall on them. Such objects might also hit the sides of the tank, causing cracks or holes that will result in disaster even if the tank doesn’t fall.\nSecure the Stand\nOne of the most important ways to earthquake proof an aquarium is to secure the stand, since if the stand begins to rock too much the aquarium is almost certain to fall. Bolt the stand to the wall, ensuring it is bolted to the studs and not the hollow part of the wall. The best way to do this is to use angle brackets that attach to both the stand and the wall. Screws and bolts must be large enough be effective, but the exact size will depend on the size of the aquarium and the stand. Many experts recommend also using angle brackets to bolt the aquarium stand to the floor.\nIn areas that are at high risk for earthquakes, the California Department of Food and Agriculture recommends placing aquariums on the floor instead of on stands or shelving. This can be a very effective means of reducing the likelihood that the aquarium will tip or fall during a quake. Tall aquariums are especially suited to such a measure, but it makes any aquarium setup less vulnerable to tipping and swaying.\nA secure stand is an important part of earthquake-proofing an aquarium, but bolting down an ordinary flat-topped stand is of little value in a quake of any size. As the stand rocks, the aquarium will end up sliding in the opposite direction, and ultimately it will crash to the floor. A stand with a high lip all the way around can prevent this. Ensure the lip has some strength to it and is not merely decorative.\n- Photo Credit fish tank image by Tammy Mobley from Fotolia.com", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:c098b816-4b2d-44dc-9b3d-727beb320f85>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "1.

Will it be made of a lightweight fabric such as muslin, cotton or linen? Or do you want a heavy velvet curtain for a luxury boudoir vibe? Well, whatever you choose - make sure to think about your curtain rod. It will need to be able to take the weight of whatever you put on it. Also worth thinking about is whether you'll be pulling the curtains every day, or whether they'll serve mainly as decoration.\nThen you have a choice:\n- Conventional rods - where the rod goes through the curtain itself. Get them in iron, wood, PVC, acrylic… the possibilities are endless! We recommend iron or wood for a sophisticated, and sturdy, finish.\n- Traverse rods - this is when the curtain is clipped below the rod, rather than going through it. Looks super stylish, and you can choose from an interesting variety of clip styles!\n- Dauphine rods - flat faced, and therefore hidden from view. More suited to lightweight materials. Good for curved windows!\n- Electrical rods - yes, thanks to technology, you don’t even need to get out of bed to shut these curtains.

If you hang your rods to look like they re hugging the window it makes the window and as a result pretty much the entire room feel smaller.\nThe general rule is t o mount the rod anywhere between halfway to two thirds between the top of the window frame and the ceiling or ceiling molding. People usually expect curtains to hang just above the tops of windows. In this process you might need a hand to help measurement you should also do it carefully.\nWhile the task of hanging curtains is simple deciding how to hang them takes some thought. If using standard pinch pleat curtains and the curtains are to hang freely from the ceiling it may be necessary to add a panel to the bottom of the curtains to make the curtains reach the floor. For instance the extra height it adds can make your ceilings look higher.\nYou can achieve this look in any room with a few simple steps nbsp. Or more specifically hang curtains high enough that you give off the illusion of hanging curtains from. Hanging curtains from the ceiling may seem daunting but it has many benefits.\nHang curtains at least 4 to 6 inches above the top of the windows.\n\nDocument 9: Dangerous Spots in an Apartment\n- Near windows\n- Near tall furniture (shelves, bookcases, etc.)\n- Near cabinets\n- Inside doorways\n- Narrow spaces (closets, bathrooms, etc.)\nWindows and Other Glass\nWindows and other forms of glass are very likely to shatter during an earthquake. Your first priority should be to get away from any windows in your apartment as quickly as possible. If you take shelter under furniture that is near a window, try to face away from it in case it breaks.\nMake sure to keep your eyes closed as you take cover, to prevent any broken glass from entering them. After the earthquake ends, be careful not to step on any shards of glass that may be on the floor.\nMany injuries during an earthquake are a result of furniture collapsing on victims. If you cannot get under a sturdy piece of furniture, avoid any open spaces where bookshelves, TV stands, mirrors, etc. could fall on you. As a precautionary measure, you should consider rearranging any rooms that may have multiple pieces of tall furniture in them so you can create a safer space if they were to collapse.\nThe kitchen is one of the most dangerous places to be, because dishes, pots, and pans can fall from the shelves and cabinets. If you are in the kitchen when an earthquake begins, get under your kitchen table. If you don’t have a table, then try to crawl out of the kitchen as quickly as possible.\nAlso, get away from the stove if you are cooking. Anything on the stove could fall over and burn you. Most stoves in Japan are designed to automatically turn off during an earthquake, so do not go near it in an attempt to shut it down. Don’t panic if hot food starts to spill across the floor. Continue to crawl away to a safer location where it can’t reach you.\nMany people believe that doorways are a safe place to stand during an earthquake, but this is simply not true. The door could swing and injure you if you are near it and it is left open. Many door frames are constructed from wood, and these have a tendency to become stuck due to damage from the shaking.\nAs a precaution, take note of which doors in your apartment have a wooden frame versus a metal frame.\n\nDocument 10: Virtually everything I read about arranging bedroom furniture insists that that the bed should face the bedroom entrance, and especially that you don't want to present a side view of the bed.\nI am not willing to be shredded by shards of falling glass when the next earthquake comes, and I have windows opposite the bedroom door. If I put the bed against one of the side walls, then my husband and I have to play leapfrog to get in and out of bed. What is a SFan to do?\nNote: Include a pic of your problem and your question gets posted first.\nEmail questions & pics with QUESTIONS in subject line to: sf(at)apartmenttherapy(dot)com\nLink To All Good Questions\nYou might find it interesting that Feng Shui adherents prefer to keep the doorway within sight while sleeping, but (and this is important) the end of the bed (and the soles of the feet when lying down) must be out of doorway alignment. Lying in bed with your soles directly facing the door is called the coffin position....because the dead were traditionally carried out feet first.\nWe're not slaves to Feng Shui or any other space planning philosophy, but we do find that the \"coffin position\" can give us the heebeejeebees. It seems your problem is its own solution: sleep sideways, be earthquake safe, and don't worry about anyone's rules,\n(Incidentally, if you have the opposite problem and must lay out your bedroom so that you sleep with your soles facing the door, Feng Shui recommends \"a solid object at the foot of the bed.\")\nAnyone else have a strong opinion on this one?\n\nDocument 11: You should be very careful and stay away from the exterior walls, glass and heavy furniture. At the time of earthquake the most vulnerable place in the house is the kitchen and you should never take refuge in your kitchen.\nIf you’re fortunate enough to outside the house at the time of the earthquake then find out an open ground and get out the vicinities of the surrounding buildings. If you are in office then move away from the exterior windows in the heavy furniture is and do not use the electronic elevators.\nThis article also published at article directories.

Even outside of such zones it is possible to experience events that can cause an aquarium to plummet to the floor, such as strong winds that come with hurricanes and tornadoes. Even a mild quake can knock things over, including aquariums, unless they are solidly secured in such a way that they are unlikely to fall. While a large earthquake could still send the aquarium crashing, the chances of it staying in place are much better if you take some precautions.\nTo protect fish in the event of an earthquake, avoid having heavy rocks or other decorations stacked up in such a way that they could easily fall during moderate shaking. Heavy items can crush fish if they fall on them. Such objects might also hit the sides of the tank, causing cracks or holes that will result in disaster even if the tank doesn’t fall.\nSecure the Stand\nOne of the most important ways to earthquake proof an aquarium is to secure the stand, since if the stand begins to rock too much the aquarium is almost certain to fall. Bolt the stand to the wall, ensuring it is bolted to the studs and not the hollow part of the wall. The best way to do this is to use angle brackets that attach to both the stand and the wall. Screws and bolts must be large enough be effective, but the exact size will depend on the size of the aquarium and the stand. Many experts recommend also using angle brackets to bolt the aquarium stand to the floor.\nIn areas that are at high risk for earthquakes, the California Department of Food and Agriculture recommends placing aquariums on the floor instead of on stands or shelving. This can be a very effective means of reducing the likelihood that the aquarium will tip or fall during a quake. Tall aquariums are especially suited to such a measure, but it makes any aquarium setup less vulnerable to tipping and swaying.\nA secure stand is an important part of earthquake-proofing an aquarium, but bolting down an ordinary flat-topped stand is of little value in a quake of any size. As the stand rocks, the aquarium will end up sliding in the opposite direction, and ultimately it will crash to the floor. A stand with a high lip all the way around can prevent this. Ensure the lip has some strength to it and is not merely decorative.\n- Photo Credit fish tank image by Tammy Mobley from Fotolia.com\n\nDocument 13: 1.

I’ve never had a problem with these, but if I were telling you how to do this (which I am), I say go with LED for extra safety.\nYou can find the remote control light switch plug adapter with the Christmas lights in any hardware or home center store. The switch consists of a plug adapter and a remote. You’ll plug your lights into the adapter and plug the adapter into the wall socket. Then you’ll put the remote at your bedside so you can easily turn the lights off and on from bed.\nHow to put it all together:\n- Decide where the bed will be going. You don’t want to change your mind once this piece is installed!\n- Mark how high you want the curtain to hang (86 inches if you you have a standard 84″ curtain and curtain clips), and then measure and mark 3 inches out from each side of the bed. This is where you will hang the mounting hardware for the curtain rod. You want the curtain to extend a couple of inches on either side of the bed, to account for the bed linens fluffing out a little. This will give you a more balanced look.\n- Mount the hardware for the curtain rod, as well as the center support.\n- Attach the curtain panels to the curtain clips, and thread the clips onto the curtain rod. For a seamless look, join the edges of the curtain panels together on one clip, with the seams facing backwards to the wall. Then hang everything up to be sure it looks centered and balanced.\n- Remove the curtain and rod, and set aside.\n- At about 4 inches below the curtain rod, nail 8 small nails or tacks into the wall at intervals of about 8-9 inches apart. (Because I’m just *that* cheap, I used a leftover unbrella light set that used to be on my patio umbrella, so my pattern looks more like a shell than a grid, like yours will.)\n- String your lights over the nails. (If you are using tacks, be sure to stick them into the wall beside the wire, not through it!) You can also use nails at the bottom of the string lights to make sure your strings line up the way you like, and stay put. It doesn’t need to be perfect (as you can see from the picture above!), just somewhat consistent.\n\nQuestion: What safety precaution should be taken when hanging a curtain rod above a bed in earthquake-prone areas?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "In earthquake-prone areas, it is crucial to take specific safety precautions when hanging a curtain rod above a bed to prevent potential hazards during seismic events. When hanging curtains, consider the weight of the curtains and the strength of the rod to ensure it can support the fabric. However, for earthquake safety, additional measures are necessary.\n\nTo ensure safety, consider the following precautions:\n1. Use a sturdy, securely anchored rod: Ensure the curtain rod is securely fastened to the ceiling or wall studs using appropriate brackets and screws.\n2. Avoid heavy curtains: Opt for lightweight curtains to reduce the risk of the rod or curtains causing injury if they fall.\n3. Secure the rod to the ceiling: If possible, install the rod directly into the ceiling rather than using wall-mounted brackets. This can provide additional stability during an earthquake.\n4. Keep the area clear: Ensure there is no clutter or heavy furniture near the bed that could be knocked over and cause injury.\n5. Consider alternative lighting: If using string lights or other decorative elements, ensure they are securely fastened and do not pose a risk of falling.\n\nIn addition to these general safety measures, specific methods for hanging curtains without damaging walls or floors can be employed. For instance, tension rods can be used to hang curtains without drilling or nails, providing a no-damage solution. Magnetic curtain rods are another option, especially for steel surfaces, offering a secure and easy-to-install alternative. Clip rings can also be used to hang curtains without damaging walls, allowing for easy adjustment and maintenance.\n\nFurthermore, securing furniture and items within the room can help prevent them from becoming hazards during an earthquake. This includes using L-shaped brackets to secure large furniture to walls or ceilings, placing heavy items near floor level, and ensuring that all cabinets have strong latches.\n\nBy following these precautions, you can minimize the risk of injury from a curtain rod above a bed during an earthquake in an earthquake-prone area. These measures will help ensure the safety of your living space during seismic events."}
{"id": 28, "question": "What is the main difference between Ganoderma lucidum and Ganoderma tsugae fungi in terms of where they grow?", "passages": [{"passage": "Ganoderma lucidum, is an interesting shelf fungus that is important as a medicine in the Far East, in places such as China, Japan and Korea. G. lucidum is of particular interest because it has been portrayed as a \"fix-it-all\" herbal remedy for maladies such as: HIV, cancer, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, diabetes, rheumatism, heart problems, paralysis, ulcers, asthma, tiredness, hepatitis A, B, and C, insomnia, sterility, psoriasis, mumps, epilepsy, alcoholism, and the list goes on. These claims are mostly made by the people who are selling G. lucidum herbal supplements, but G. lucidum, also known as Reishi, ling chih, and ling zhi has a long history of being used as an herbal remedy. We will get to that later.\nFirst, how do you identify Ganoderma lucidum? Ganoderma is a member of the Polypores, a group of fungi characterized by the presence of pores, instead of gills on the underside of the fruiting body. G. lucidum, considered by many mycophiles to be one of the most beautiful shelf fungi, it is distinguished by its varnished, red surface. When it is young it also has white and yellow shades on the varnished surface, differing from the dull surface of Ganoderma applanatum, the artist's conk. G. lucidum is a saprophytic fungus that tends to grow more prolifically in warm climates on decaying hardwood logs and stumps. This feature helps to distinguish it from a similar looking Ganoderma tsugae, which also has a beautiful red varnished surface, but only grows on the stumps and logs of conifers, especially hemlock (as you might guess from the name). Another distinguishing characteristic is the flesh of G. tsugae is white whereas the flesh of G. lucidum is brown. Besides the shelf form, both G. tsugae and G. lucidum can be stalked. The spore prints of both species are brown and the spores are very similar in size and shape.\nGanoderma curtisii is considered by some mycologists to be a different species because of its brighter yellow colors and geographic restriction to the southeaster United States.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:b2e7717d-13f6-4c81-b9bf-9de343298647>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "- Ganoderma tsugae - A polypore which grows on conifers, especially hemlock, giving it its common name, hemlock varnish shelf.

In \"North American Polypores,\" practically the bible for wood-decaying poroid fungi, Gilbertson and Ryvarden, do not consider G. curtisii a species separate from G. lucidum. Another fungus that resembles G. lucidum is Ganoderma oregonense, which, like G. tsugae grows on conifers, but is found in the Pacific Northwest and New Mexico. G. oregonense can get up to 1 meter across and has slightly larger spores than G. lucidum and G. tsugae. There are arguments that these four separate species (G. lucidum, G. tsugae, G. curtisii, and G. oregonense) should be considered one species. The reasons for keeping them apart are primarily due to the host specificity of each fungus. Interestingly, if given only either hardwood or conifer wood in culture, each of the four species can grow and produce fruiting bodies, despite their natural occurrence on only one of those substrates.\nIn 1995, Moncalvo, Wang and Hseu, isolated the DNA of G. tsugae and G. lucidum and found that it was hard to tell the difference between the two species. An even more recent study in 2004 by Hong and Jung, found that G. lucidum from Asia was in its own group, whereas, G. lucidum from Europe and the Americas was more closely related to G. tsugae. Clearly, further investigation into the molecular make up of these two species is needed.

The genus may now be divided into six monophyletic groups:\n- G. colossus group\n- G. applanatum group\n- G. tsugae group\n- Asian G. lucidum group\n- G. meredithiae group\n- G. resinaceum group\nWith the rise of molecular phylogenies in the late 20th century, species concept hypotheses were tested to determine the relatedness amongst the nuanced morphological variabilities of the laccate Ganoderma taxa. In 1995, Moncalvo et al constructed a phylogeny of the rDNA, which was the universally accepted locus at that time, and found five major clades of the laccate species amongst the 29 isolates tested. It turned out that G. lucidum was not a monophyletic species, and further work needed to be done to clarify this taxonomic problem. They also found that G. resinaceum from Europe, and the North American 'G. lucidum', which Adaskaveg and Gilbertson found to be biologically compatible in vitro, did not cluster together. Moncalvo et al. reject biological species complexes as a sole tool to distinguish a taxon, and suggested using a combination between biological and phylogenetic species concepts to define unique Ganoderma taxa.\nIn 1905, American mycologist William Murrill delineated the genus Tomophagus to accommodate the single species G. colossus (then known as Polyporus colossus) which had distinctive morphological features that did not fit in with the other species.

They have a high genetic diversity and is used in traditional Asian medicines. Ganoderma can be differentiated from other polypores because they have a double-walled basidiospore. They may be called shelf mushrooms or bracket fungi.\nThe genus Ganoderma was established as a genus in 1881 by Karsten and included only one species, G. lucidum (Curtis) Karst. Previously, this taxon was characterized as Boletus lucidus Curtis (1781) and then Polyporus lucidus (Curtis) Fr. (1821) (Karsten 1881). The species P. lucidus was characterized by having a laccate (shiny or polished) pileus and stipe, and this is a character that Murrill suspected was the reason for Karsten's division because only one species was included, G. lucidum . Patouillard revised Karsten's genus Ganoderma to include all species with pigmented spores, adhering tubes and laccate crusted pilei, which resulted with a total of 48 species classified under the genus Ganoderma in his 1889 monograph.

They have double-walled, truncate spores with yellow to brown ornamented inner layers.\nThe genus was named by Karsten in 1881.

Under commercial cultivation conditions, G. lucidum is normally grown on artificial sawdust logs, as shown to the right. We'll cover this cultivation method in more detail in a later Fungus of the Month. Other methods of cultivating G. lucidum and many other fungi can be found in Paul Stamets' book, \"Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms\"\nNow let's look at the medicinal uses of G. lucidum or Reishi.

The first historical mention of G. lucidum was during the rule of the first Chinese emperor, Shin-huag of the Ch'in Dynasty, when the fungus's medicinal uses are first described. In fact, a Reishi Goddess, known as Reishi senshi, was worshipped because she would bestow health, life and eternal youth.\nThere are two different types of Reishi, the traditional wide, shelf-like fruiting body and the antler shape, known as Rokkaku-Reishi.

It keeps a dominant and honorable place in Asia, a rich region where it has been used as a powerful medicinal mushroom for over 4,000 years. Also known as the Miraculous King of Herbs, Ganoderma earned more popularity due to the advanced health benefits it brings. Its scientific name was derived from a Greek term that refers to bright and shiny skin. In Chinese, the word Lingzhi pertains to an herb known for spiritual potency and has been recognized as the mushroom of immortality. The mere origin of its name tells a lot about its role in the field of traditional and modern medicine.\nThanks to the modern developments in science and technology, ganoderma companies and their strategic partners have created 100% organic Ganoderma Lucidum capsules, Ganoderma Mycellium Healthy Beverages, Ganoderma Spore Powder, and skin care products.

The word Ganoderma lucidum was derived from two Latin words, ‘Gan’ which means shiny and ‘Derm’ meaning skin and ‘Lucidum’ with the meaning ‘brilliant’. This term describes the glossy appearance of the mushroom. The reishi mushroom bears the nickname “queen of mushrooms” as it has been revered by Chinese people for ages. In China, it is popularly known as “Ling Zhi” which means a spiritual or miraculous mushroom, “Rui-Zhi”, and “Chi-Zhi. In Japan, it is referred to as “Reishi”, “Sachitake” or “Mannatake”. Americans commonly refer to it as Reishi while the Koreans named it “Youngzhi”, while it is wideley referred to as the “mushroom of immortality”. This mushroom belongs to the family Ganodermataceae and the genus Ganoderma. The term reishi is usually used when naming a group of closely related species of mushrooms that grow in woodlands particularly, Ganoderma tsugae, Ganoderma sinesis and Ganoderma lucidum. The species Ganoderma lucidum is the one with the highest demand in the human health realms.\nReishi mushrooms thrive best in the wild, particularly in temperate and humid forests found in the mountains in Asia. The forests are usually located in very remote areas that are free from pollution that has clouded a majority of cities today. The reishi mushroom is a polypore, a sizeable group of mushrooms that form on dead and decaying hardwood trees. They have tubes on the underside of their cap with white pores that produce a large number of spores within a short time. A single fungus can give rise to not more than three fruiting bodies. The fruiting body can be flat, shaped like a kidney and grows over 8cm in width. Alternatively, it can be tiny and assume the shape of a cloud. The skin of reishi mushrooms has a reddish-brown glossy appearance. However, the colour ranges from black to purple in certain locations.

Reishi Mushroom is most prevalent in the Asian countries such as Japan, China, North and South Korea, Taiwan Indonesia and several other Asian countries. Reishi Mushroom is a broad, dark mushroom distinguished by its glossy exterior and woody texture. This suggests the origin of its name lucidum, which is derived from the Latin word “lucidus”. Lucidus simply connotes brilliant or shiny and this refers to the shiny surface of the Ganoderma mushroom.\nDifferent parts of the Asian countries have different names for Ganoderma lucidum for example, the Japanese people refer to it as rōmaji, 霊芝, the Chinese people call it língzhī, Ling Zhi, pinyin or 靈芝 while the Vietnamese refer to it as linh chi. Ganoderma is considered a miraculous plant thus the reason it is mostly used for medicinal purposes, especially in the Asian continent. Ganoderma lucidum produces a group of triterpenes known as ganoderic acids. Ganoderic acids possess a molecular structure that is related to steroid hormones.\nOther sterols found in reishi mushroom are; lucidadiol, ganoderol, ganodermadiol, ganoderiol and ganodermanontriol. Ganoderma also contains adenosine, alkaloids, coumarin, organic germanium, mannitol and polysaccharides (e.g. beta-glucan). Ganoderma lucidum has a strong bitter taste thus it is traditionally prepared as a hot water extract.\nLi and Wang (2006) showed that a ganoderic acid isolated from Ganoderma lucidum exhibited inhibitory effects on the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HepG2215 cells (HepG2- HBV-producing cell line) over 8 days.

In \"North American Polypores,\" practically the bible for wood-decaying poroid fungi, Gilbertson and Ryvarden, do not consider G. curtisii a species separate from G. lucidum. Another fungus that resembles G. lucidum is Ganoderma oregonense, which, like G. tsugae grows on conifers, but is found in the Pacific Northwest and New Mexico. G. oregonense can get up to 1 meter across and has slightly larger spores than G. lucidum and G. tsugae. There are arguments that these four separate species (G. lucidum, G. tsugae, G. curtisii, and G. oregonense) should be considered one species. The reasons for keeping them apart are primarily due to the host specificity of each fungus. Interestingly, if given only either hardwood or conifer wood in culture, each of the four species can grow and produce fruiting bodies, despite their natural occurrence on only one of those substrates.\nIn 1995, Moncalvo, Wang and Hseu, isolated the DNA of G. tsugae and G. lucidum and found that it was hard to tell the difference between the two species. An even more recent study in 2004 by Hong and Jung, found that G. lucidum from Asia was in its own group, whereas, G. lucidum from Europe and the Americas was more closely related to G. tsugae. Clearly, further investigation into the molecular make up of these two species is needed.

G. lucidum is of particular interest because it has been portrayed as a \"fix-it-all\" herbal remedy for maladies such as: HIV, cancer, low blood pressure, high blood pressure, diabetes, rheumatism, heart problems, paralysis, ulcers, asthma, tiredness, hepatitis A, B, and C, insomnia, sterility, psoriasis, mumps, epilepsy, alcoholism, and the list goes on. These claims are mostly made by the people who are selling G. lucidum herbal supplements, but G. lucidum, also known as Reishi, ling chih, and ling zhi has a long history of being used as an herbal remedy. We will get to that later.\nFirst, how do you identify Ganoderma lucidum? Ganoderma is a member of the Polypores, a group of fungi characterized by the presence of pores, instead of gills on the underside of the fruiting body. G. lucidum, considered by many mycophiles to be one of the most beautiful shelf fungi, it is distinguished by its varnished, red surface. When it is young it also has white and yellow shades on the varnished surface, differing from the dull surface of Ganoderma applanatum, the artist's conk. G. lucidum is a saprophytic fungus that tends to grow more prolifically in warm climates on decaying hardwood logs and stumps. This feature helps to distinguish it from a similar looking Ganoderma tsugae, which also has a beautiful red varnished surface, but only grows on the stumps and logs of conifers, especially hemlock (as you might guess from the name). Another distinguishing characteristic is the flesh of G. tsugae is white whereas the flesh of G. lucidum is brown. Besides the shelf form, both G. tsugae and G. lucidum can be stalked. The spore prints of both species are brown and the spores are very similar in size and shape.\nGanoderma curtisii is considered by some mycologists to be a different species because of its brighter yellow colors and geographic restriction to the southeaster United States.\n\nDocument 3: - Ganoderma tsugae - A polypore which grows on conifers, especially hemlock, giving it its common name, hemlock varnish shelf.

The genus may now be divided into six monophyletic groups:\n- G. colossus group\n- G. applanatum group\n- G. tsugae group\n- Asian G. lucidum group\n- G. meredithiae group\n- G. resinaceum group\nWith the rise of molecular phylogenies in the late 20th century, species concept hypotheses were tested to determine the relatedness amongst the nuanced morphological variabilities of the laccate Ganoderma taxa. In 1995, Moncalvo et al constructed a phylogeny of the rDNA, which was the universally accepted locus at that time, and found five major clades of the laccate species amongst the 29 isolates tested. It turned out that G. lucidum was not a monophyletic species, and further work needed to be done to clarify this taxonomic problem. They also found that G. resinaceum from Europe, and the North American 'G. lucidum', which Adaskaveg and Gilbertson found to be biologically compatible in vitro, did not cluster together. Moncalvo et al. reject biological species complexes as a sole tool to distinguish a taxon, and suggested using a combination between biological and phylogenetic species concepts to define unique Ganoderma taxa.\nIn 1905, American mycologist William Murrill delineated the genus Tomophagus to accommodate the single species G. colossus (then known as Polyporus colossus) which had distinctive morphological features that did not fit in with the other species. Historically, however, Tomophagus has generally been regarded as a synonym for Ganoderma. Nearly a century later, phylogenetic analyses vindicated Murrill's original placement, as it has shown to be a taxonomically distinct appropriate genus.\n\nDocument 5: Ganoderma Applanatum Extract Tincture Pure Wild Crafted\nWhat is Ganoderma Applanatum as a Medical Mushroom?\nGanoderma Applanatum is often consumed as a tea and has a rich, smoky taste.

They have a high genetic diversity and is used in traditional Asian medicines. Ganoderma can be differentiated from other polypores because they have a double-walled basidiospore. They may be called shelf mushrooms or bracket fungi.\nThe genus Ganoderma was established as a genus in 1881 by Karsten and included only one species, G. lucidum (Curtis) Karst. Previously, this taxon was characterized as Boletus lucidus Curtis (1781) and then Polyporus lucidus (Curtis) Fr. (1821) (Karsten 1881). The species P. lucidus was characterized by having a laccate (shiny or polished) pileus and stipe, and this is a character that Murrill suspected was the reason for Karsten's division because only one species was included, G. lucidum . Patouillard revised Karsten's genus Ganoderma to include all species with pigmented spores, adhering tubes and laccate crusted pilei, which resulted with a total of 48 species classified under the genus Ganoderma in his 1889 monograph. Until Murrill investigated Ganoderma in North America in 1902, previous work had focused solely on European species including, for example, G. lucidum, G. resinaceum Boud. (1890) and G. valesiacum Boud. (1895).\nGanoderma are characterized by basidiocarps that are large, perennial, woody brackets also called \"conks\". They are lignicolous and leathery either with or without a stem. The fruit bodies typically grow in a fan-like or hoof-like form on the trunks of living or dead trees. They have double-walled, truncate spores with yellow to brown ornamented inner layers.\nThe genus was named by Karsten in 1881. Members of the family Ganodermataceae were traditionally considered difficult to classify because of the lack of reliable morphological characteristics, the overabundance of synonyms, and the widespread misuse of names.\n\nDocument 10: Mycologia 96: 742-755.\nGanoderma lucidum, considered rare and hard to find in nature in China and Japan, is now commonly cultured. It can be cultured on logs that are buried in shady, moist areas. G. lucidum can also be inoculated onto hardwood stumps. Under commercial cultivation conditions, G. lucidum is normally grown on artificial sawdust logs, as shown to the right. We'll cover this cultivation method in more detail in a later Fungus of the Month. Other methods of cultivating G. lucidum and many other fungi can be found in Paul Stamets' book, \"Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms\"\nNow let's look at the medicinal uses of G. lucidum or Reishi. If you feel the fruiting bodies, you'll notice that they're very hard, so no one tries to eat them like most (softer) mushrooms-- too tough! It has been used as an herbal remedy for such things as health, recuperation, longevity, wisdom and happiness for centuries in Asian traditional medicine. The first historical mention of G. lucidum was during the rule of the first Chinese emperor, Shin-huag of the Ch'in Dynasty, when the fungus's medicinal uses are first described. In fact, a Reishi Goddess, known as Reishi senshi, was worshipped because she would bestow health, life and eternal youth.\nThere are two different types of Reishi, the traditional wide, shelf-like fruiting body and the antler shape, known as Rokkaku-Reishi. The antler shape arises from varying carbon dioxide levels and low light. These two types are rumored to have different healing characteristics. Recently, there have been a large amount of scientific papers published with experiments attempting to quantify the effect of G. lucidum on the human body. The fungal extract has been shown to act on immune system cells, to work against herpes virus, to lower cholesterol and stop cell proliferation.\nUnfortunately, while reading these papers it seems important to remind you that we are still not sure if G. lucidum and G. tsugae are separate species.\nAlthough the molecular make up has yet to be determined conclusively, several biologically active compounds from G. lucidum have been characterized.\n\nDocument 11: Purple Reishi (Ganoderma sinense) is a polypore mushroom that is native to Asia, specifically to China and Japan. It grows on both broadleaf trees and conifers but is very rare and notoriously difficult to find in the wild. Its modern scarcity may be partly due to industrial deforestation and the dramatic loss of biodiversity in some of its native forests, although historically it was never found in any great abundance.\nTraditionally it was often used interchangeably with Red Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum). It is for this reason that both species are referred to as ‘Lingzhi‘ in traditional Chinese medicine. They both play a very similar ecological role within the forest and share a broad number of health benefits, but in truth the two species are notably different in a number of ways.\nWhile this mushroom usually exhibits a dark purple hue, it also commonly presents dark brown to almost black colouring. It is typically much darker than Red Reishi, has a less bitter, slightly sweet taste and a different arrangement and concentration of biologically active compounds.\nAs already mentioned, this species was a rarity throughout history. It therapeutic potency was formidable, yet before it was cultivated the wild mushroom was sparse and foraging it was a challenge. Thankfully, the cultivation of this species has developed into a fine art when done thoroughly and conscientiously.\nPurple Reishi can be grown using the same methods as Red Reishi cultivation, but in an attempt to save time and money, many growers will cut corners and yield small, medicinally inferior fruiting bodies. However, if wild-simulated Di Tao practices are adhered to, mushrooms exhibiting the qualities and properties of the finest wild specimens can be produced. To learn more about these practices, read the Methods of Cultivation chapter on our main page about Reishi.\nAs with Red Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum), Purple Reishi contains hundreds of different compounds that collaborate synergistically to produce a collective ‘entourage effect‘. There are many proteins and fatty acids, sterols, polyphenols and trace elements, but the compounds understood to be the most powerful and have a ‘directing’ influence over the medicinal activity, are the fungal polysaccharides and triterpenes.\nComparisons between G. sinense and G. lucidum show that overall, their polysaccharide and especially β-d-glucan content is very similar with no striking differences between the two.\n\nDocument 12: What is Ganoderma?\nGanoderma is probably the biggest mystery in the East that has been revealed after years of scientific research. Considered as Chinas natural treasure, ganoderma plantations have harvested its power and turned into the home of 100% organic Ganoderma.\nIn Cantonese, Reishi or Lingzhi refers to one of the types of Ganoderma Lucidum mushrooms. It keeps a dominant and honorable place in Asia, a rich region where it has been used as a powerful medicinal mushroom for over 4,000 years. Also known as the Miraculous King of Herbs, Ganoderma earned more popularity due to the advanced health benefits it brings. Its scientific name was derived from a Greek term that refers to bright and shiny skin. In Chinese, the word Lingzhi pertains to an herb known for spiritual potency and has been recognized as the mushroom of immortality. The mere origin of its name tells a lot about its role in the field of traditional and modern medicine.\nThanks to the modern developments in science and technology, ganoderma companies and their strategic partners have created 100% organic Ganoderma Lucidum capsules, Ganoderma Mycellium Healthy Beverages, Ganoderma Spore Powder, and skin care products. With these companies dedication to maximizing the potentials of Ganoderma, their research and development team has come up with an expanding line of clinically tested Ganoderma-based products.\nThe main processing plant used for manufacturing Ganoderma-based products submits to the highest GMP standards in the world. With an exclusive breakthrough called the Advanced Micro-Particle Technology, they have applied this discovery to boost the process of breaking spore cell walls. This fact guarantees these companies as the leading brands that produces products that were infused with 100% certified Ganoderma Lucidum.\nGanoderma's home may be China, but these companies and their growing team of skilled distributors are ready to share the wonders of Ganoderma with the rest of the world.\n\nDocument 13: About Reishi Mushroom\nThe reishi mushroom (Ganoderma lucidum) is a fungus that predominantly grows in tropical and subtropical woodlands in the Asian continent. The word Ganoderma lucidum was derived from two Latin words, ‘Gan’ which means shiny and ‘Derm’ meaning skin and ‘Lucidum’ with the meaning ‘brilliant’. This term describes the glossy appearance of the mushroom. The reishi mushroom bears the nickname “queen of mushrooms” as it has been revered by Chinese people for ages. In China, it is popularly known as “Ling Zhi” which means a spiritual or miraculous mushroom, “Rui-Zhi”, and “Chi-Zhi. In Japan, it is referred to as “Reishi”, “Sachitake” or “Mannatake”. Americans commonly refer to it as Reishi while the Koreans named it “Youngzhi”, while it is wideley referred to as the “mushroom of immortality”. This mushroom belongs to the family Ganodermataceae and the genus Ganoderma. The term reishi is usually used when naming a group of closely related species of mushrooms that grow in woodlands particularly, Ganoderma tsugae, Ganoderma sinesis and Ganoderma lucidum. The species Ganoderma lucidum is the one with the highest demand in the human health realms.\nReishi mushrooms thrive best in the wild, particularly in temperate and humid forests found in the mountains in Asia. The forests are usually located in very remote areas that are free from pollution that has clouded a majority of cities today. The reishi mushroom is a polypore, a sizeable group of mushrooms that form on dead and decaying hardwood trees. They have tubes on the underside of their cap with white pores that produce a large number of spores within a short time. A single fungus can give rise to not more than three fruiting bodies. The fruiting body can be flat, shaped like a kidney and grows over 8cm in width. Alternatively, it can be tiny and assume the shape of a cloud. The skin of reishi mushrooms has a reddish-brown glossy appearance. However, the colour ranges from black to purple in certain locations. Mature reishi and growing reishi feel soft, like a sponge.\n\nDocument 14: Maciá-Vicente, H.B. Bode, and M.

Reishi Mushroom is most prevalent in the Asian countries such as Japan, China, North and South Korea, Taiwan Indonesia and several other Asian countries. Reishi Mushroom is a broad, dark mushroom distinguished by its glossy exterior and woody texture. This suggests the origin of its name lucidum, which is derived from the Latin word “lucidus”. Lucidus simply connotes brilliant or shiny and this refers to the shiny surface of the Ganoderma mushroom.\nDifferent parts of the Asian countries have different names for Ganoderma lucidum for example, the Japanese people refer to it as rōmaji, 霊芝, the Chinese people call it língzhī, Ling Zhi, pinyin or 靈芝 while the Vietnamese refer to it as linh chi. Ganoderma is considered a miraculous plant thus the reason it is mostly used for medicinal purposes, especially in the Asian continent. Ganoderma lucidum produces a group of triterpenes known as ganoderic acids. Ganoderic acids possess a molecular structure that is related to steroid hormones.\nOther sterols found in reishi mushroom are; lucidadiol, ganoderol, ganodermadiol, ganoderiol and ganodermanontriol. Ganoderma also contains adenosine, alkaloids, coumarin, organic germanium, mannitol and polysaccharides (e.g. beta-glucan). Ganoderma lucidum has a strong bitter taste thus it is traditionally prepared as a hot water extract.\nLi and Wang (2006) showed that a ganoderic acid isolated from Ganoderma lucidum exhibited inhibitory effects on the replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HepG2215 cells (HepG2- HBV-producing cell line) over 8 days. This suggests that Ganoderma is effective for treating hepatitis.\nMilk thistle is botanically known as Silybum marianum and belongs to the Asteraceae family. This plant is originally from Asia and Southern Europe before spreading to other parts of the world.\n\nDocument 16: Ganoderma spore oil is a lipid extract of Ganoderma lucidum spores, which accounts for 20% to 35% of the total weight of the spores, and is rich in biologically active ingredients, such as triterpenoid ganoderic acid, unsaturated fatty acids, and steroids. Ganoderma spore oil has special physiological effects and has broad market prospects in the field of health products and medicine.\nGanoderma lucidum, also known as fungus Ganoderma lucidum, or Ganoderma lucidum, is a genus of Ganoderma lucidum in the family Basidiomycetes Polyporus. It is a mushroom parasitic on the roots of the oak and other broad-leaved trees. Umbrella-shaped, hard, woody, kidney-capped or semicircular, purple-brown with paint-like luster.\nThe ancient Orientals praised Ganoderma lucidum as a “magic panacea” that can be brought back to life and a “celestial herb” that cures all diseases. Modern scientific and clinical medical studies have proved that Ganoderma lucidum contains rich nutrients and biologically active substances, and it has a tonic and strong effect, it is the most ideal natural medicine and healthy food for human beings.\nGanoderma lucidum spore powder\nThe Ganoderma lucidum spore powder is the seed of Ganoderma lucidum. It is the extremely tiny egg-shaped reproductive cells ejected from Ganoderma lucidum pleats during the growth and maturity of Ganoderma lucidum. It is only 4-6 micrometers and is a living organism.\nThe spore powder contains all the active essences of Ganoderma lucidum. It contains 18 kinds of active amino acids, more than 20 kinds of polysaccharides, alkaloids, organic germanium, terpenoids, various vitamins, trace elements, and other pharmacologically active ingredients. Longevity and longevity can significantly improve the body’s immune function. It has antiviral, anticancer, tumor-suppressing, hypoglycemic, and other functions. Its medicinal value is much higher than that of Ganoderma lucidum fruiting body and mycelium.\n\nQuestion: What is the main difference between Ganoderma lucidum and Ganoderma tsugae fungi in terms of where they grow?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Ganoderma lucidum and Ganoderma tsugae are two species of fungi that differ primarily in their preferred habitats. Ganoderma lucidum typically grows on decaying hardwood logs and stumps, while Ganoderma tsugae is found on the stumps and logs of conifers, especially hemlock. This distinction in their host specificity is a key factor in differentiating the two species."}
{"id": 29, "question": "What are the main challenges India faces in its power sector regarding electricity access and supply?", "passages": [{"passage": "It is often said that sectoral reforms have a very non-linear path. Electricity in India is a good example. The central challenges identified were inadequate generation capacity, high distribution losses, and free (and, in case of many states, unmetered) farm power.\nThe first generation of power reforms, initiated at the turn of the century, involved unbundling integrated utilities by separating generation, transmission, and distribution. This, coupled with a series of regulations mandating competitive power purchases by distribution companies, attracted private investment into generation and installed capacity rose dramatically. Discoms had to purchase power from the market at competitive prices and also had to make immediate payments (and not run up dues) for those purchases. Often times, especially in the summers, the prices of spot purchases rose by multiples, leaving discoms with even bigger gap between cost of services and revenue recovery.\nThis disciplining constraints on the cost-side forced the discoms to get their acts together on the revenues side or figure out ways to bridge the gap. But addressing the revenues side meant lowering technical and commercial losses. Given pervasive theft of supply, billing and collection deficiencies, and unmetered (and free) agriculture supply the latter was 2-4 times the former. This required addressing challenges on state capacity (in billing and collection), political economy (free farm power), and a combination of both (theft of supply).\nNow these challenges are not easily addressed. So discoms came to rely on a combination of strategies to bridge the deficit. Primarily, they resorted to large-scale rationing of supply and suppression of demand, through what are called load-shedding or power-cuts. In fact, in India, “peak demand” is deceptive since it only conveys demand of the discoms and not of the consumers. Across vast swathes of North India, consumers are off-grid more hours than they have supply. Rural areas bear the brunt of these power cuts.\nAnother strategy was to finance the deficit with government subsidies (to the extent of government policy mandated subsidised supply, mainly to farmers) and borrowings. In many states, the government subsidies while sanctioned were never disbursed, forcing the discoms to borrow even more and continuously rolling them over. The Government of India periodically undertook discom debt restructuring schemes with ostensibly strict conditions on loss reduction.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:93c8670f-3adc-4bac-ac34-e73fe093d2c8>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "India recently experienced one of the world’s worst blackouts, with 670 million citizens directly impacted. While media reports have focused on the repercussions from two days of outages, this incident illustrates a much larger, more systemic problem: the need for improved electricity governance.\nIndia’s History of Power Problems\nIndia has the world’s fifth-largest electrical system, with an installed electric capacity of about 206 gigawatts (GW). India initiated power sector reforms in the early 1990s through a range of legal, policy, and regulatory changes. Over the last two decades, some of these reforms have been impressive, but several others weren’t taken. This lack of follow-through has resulted in a growing gap between electricity demand and supply throughout the country. Recent blackouts may have shined a spotlight on this gap, but it’s a situation that’s widespread in India: Not only do 400 million Indians lack access to electricity, but electricity supply is unreliable and of poor quality even in large parts of “electrified” India. In addition to the existing demand, Indian consumers, businesses, and industries seek more electricity to power appliances, processes, and products, further exacerbating the demand-supply gap. By 2035, India’s power demand is expected to more than double.\n3 Holes in India’s Electricity Governance\nLoss and Theft: The predominant solution proffered by policymakers in India is to increase generation capacity—unmindful of the substantial technical losses due to outdated power lines, leaky cables, and poor maintenance; commercial losses due to poor metering and local politicians’ populist “free power” policies ; and rampant electricity theft caused by people hooking up wires to overhead electricity cables. Building more power plants without fixing these problems is akin to pouring water into a bucket with large holes. With India’s power plants close to 70 percent dependent on coal and natural gas, the current coal shortages and non-availability of gas haven’t helped the situation. The Planning Commission’s Working Group on Power for the 12th Plan, among other studies, have pointed to these “holes,” but so far there’s been no serious effort made to address electricity losses or theft. No doubt, there are vested interests that benefit by the business-as-usual scenario. But there is an urgent need to hold decision-makers accountable for solving these issues on a priority and not allow them to obfuscate the situation by announcing another round of new power plants.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:442c691f-d681-49c1-bb36-c29dc058be14>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "What Do India’s Recent Electricity Sector Reforms Mean for Renewable Energy?\n|In July, 620 million people in India were plunged into darkness during the world's biggest power outage to date. (AP // Bikas Das)|\nIn the wake of massive blackouts this past summer that spanned 20 Indian states and left half of the country’s population without power, the national cabinet approved a debt restructuring program for State Electricity Boards (SEBs) in September aimed at improving the functioning and viability of India’s electricity sector. SEB debt across all states is currently over US$35 billion, or about 2 percent of the nation’s GDP.\nSEBs are state-owned utility companies responsible for operating the electricity grid and delivering electricity to customers. SEBs buy electricity from power generators at a price negotiated through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which they in turn sell to electricity consumers. Lack of necessary investment to improve grid infrastructure, widespread electricity theft, and low electricity prices that result in SEBs often selling power to customers at a loss are among the systemic problems in many states. Electricity losses during transmission and distribution to customers—due to grid inefficiencies, electricity theft, and illegal grid connections—account for more than 25 percent of power generated in India.\nThe cabinet-approved debt restructuring package aims at addressing some of these problems. Under the program, state governments will take on 50 percent of SEBs’ short-term liabilities over the next two to five years. The remaining 50 percent of short-term loans will be rescheduled by lenders, providing SEBs with favorable interest rates and a three-year moratorium on principal payments. SEBs have until the end of this year to sign on to the program, which will apply to debts accumulated through March 2013.\nIf the program has the desired impact, reduced debt pressure on the state utility companies will allow them to invest in much-needed infrastructure and operation improvements and revitalize the electricity sector by enabling new PPAs that are currently beyond SEBs’ financial capacities.\nIn order to qualify for the restructuring package, SEBs are required to implement several reforms aimed at improving their financial viability and provision of services. The conditions include that SEBs may not take on new short-term loans, must collect outstanding power dues from customers, and must reduce electricity losses by at least 25 percent. State governments must also regularly review electricity prices, which will likely result in price increases for consumers in order for SEBs to generate enough revenue to cover operating costs.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:9f477d5d-3136-4899-83f4-714870c084c8>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "India's looming power crisis: An analysis\nThere are many roadblocks in unleashing the full potential of India's power sector\nThere are many roadblocks in unleashing the full potential of India's power sector\nElectricity is critical to fuel the economic growth of India. The country is on the fast trajectory of development but to keep the momentum of growth high, availability of uninterrupted power supply is a must. India needs electricity to fuel the growth of every industry, be it large-scale or smallscale, manufacturing, healthcare or education.\nThere are many roadblocks in unleashing the full potential of India's power sector. One is fuel availability concerns faced by the industry. Coal supply by Coal India Ltd (CIL) is restricted to around 65% of actual coal requirement by coal-based thermal plants, leading to increased dependence on imported coal. This results in increasing power generation costs due to limited fuel availability. Increasing operational inefficiencies and outstanding debts have led to poor financial health of state discoms. Then there are other concerns such as land acquisition which has made purchase of land for power projects very expensive. Installation of power plants in any case, requires huge investments and the land acquisition cost pushes the capex to unprofitable and unsustainable levels.\nIndia has been dependent to a large extent on energy imports to meet its national energy requirements. As per the estimates of Planning Commission, Government of India (GoI), to ensure a sustained 8% growth of the economy, by 203132 India needs to increase its primary energy supply by three to four times and its electricity generation by five to six times of the 2003-04 levels. To limit the dependency on energy imports and contribute in meeting this energy challenge, the government is also laying a lot of emphasis on energy efficiency and demand side management. Efforts are being made to increase supply from renewable sources of energy and promote energy conservation in various consumption sectors through appropriate policy interventions.\nEnergy-efficiency is extremely important and can be promoted by setting appropriate prices and this is particularly important where energy prices are rising. However, appropriate prices by themselves may not suffice and non-price incentives/disincentives are therefore also required. This includes standards of energy efficiency that are forward looking, i.e., anticipate future price changes or pollution penalties. These standards should be determined on the basis of rational considerations and must be set in an expanding range of applications, with continuous dynamic adjustment of these standards. The standards should also be effectively enforced.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:9d9dab77-6a95-456c-8242-c87c9b2af01b>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "With its vision document, Vision 2024, India’s Ministry of Power is charting a way forward for the country’s power sector.

Each state in India has its own transmission agency, and these are networked into one of five regional grids. Over the last decade, India has embarked on a project to join the five regional grids and establish a national grid. The plan sounds good in theory, but it requires a high level of discipline in order to work. Each state government needs to coordinate with the others to ensure no one is drawing too much power or impacting another’s allocated electricity. The blame game that followed the recent blackout showcases the fact that this communication and coordination just isn’t happening yet. Also, there is really no one accountable for managing the grid, pointing to a serious accountability vacuum.\nLack of a Holistic Governance Approach: India does not have a holistic approach to electricity planning or implementation. Generation, transmission, and distribution planning (and investments in each of them) happen independent of each other; renewable energy planning takes place outside of conventional electricity planning; and service to on-grid consumers and off-grid consumers happen separately–all of which highlights the absence of an over-arching electricity governance framework. This situation has caused ad hoc and lopsided planning, with no public disclosure of information about efforts to close the electricity demand-supply gap. Plus, no one agency or institution anywhere in the country is accountable for the failure to provide affordable, reliable, and quality electricity.\nImproving India’s Electricity Governance\nThis list certainly isn’t exhaustive—several other interlinked problems contribute to the malaise affecting India’s power sector, from bad monsoons and water scarcity to inefficient electrical appliances. There are solutions to some of these concerns through improved technology (such as isolating and responding to grid problems and enhancing power plants’ efficiency) and innovative policies (like holistic planning approaches and incentivizing grid discipline), but addressing the accountability and governance issues are key to improving India’s power sector.\nWRI’s Electricity Governance Initiative (EGI) is a network of civil society organizations working to promote transparent, inclusive, and accountable decision-making in the electricity sector in several countries, including India.

I can only imagine how bad things must be in other parts of the State.\nWhile it is important to invest in upgrading the current grid infrastructure, India must take a cue from Germany and Spain (recent events notwithstanding), and aggressively promote solar photovoltaic energy by the use of feed-in tariffs.\nFeed-in tariffs are a mechanism by which a renewable energy producer signs a long-term contract with a buyer (potentially the state government agencies engaged in energy generation, transmission and distribution) to supply renewable energy at a fixed rate over a fixed period of time.\nOver time, this tariff is lowered in order to encourage technological innovation and achieve grid parity (when the price of electricity from renewable sources equals that from conventional sources). This has been the most successful policy mechanism in accelerating renewable energy deployment globally. Further, this policy enables regular people to own and sell electricity generating assets.\nThe high upfront cost of solar photovoltaics is cited as the reason for their slow deployment. While this is true, it is important to know that solar panels themselves are only a small portion of the cost of an entire solar photovoltaic system.\nThe major costs relate to Balance-of-System – mounting structures, brackets, additional power electronics (inverters) and batteries – and installation labour.\nTherefore, emphasis must be placed on lowering these costs, not just the costs of the panels alone.\nIndia must make the most of its solar resources.\nSolar photovoltaics have the potential to be a driver of economic growth while helping solve the power problem.\nThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy must look at what other developed countries have done and adopt similar policy mechanisms in order to accelerate the growth of renewable energy technologies.\n(Tejas is studying sustainable systems and energy systems engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, US.)", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:7039b310-8f83-4f5a-a966-8e20bdea4f0a>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "It is pertinent to note however, that with the on-going intensified competition in the licensed and the liberalized electrical sector, many states are beginning to pull their stocks together, shedding the complacency of monopoly to face the competition.\nIndia also faces the problem of inadequate coal and gas production as well as exploration of new fossil fuel reserves.\nIt is evident that constant power supply is essential for the growth of any nation. India has set out a target to be a global super power having the third largest GDP by 2030 and also to have a sustained economic growth of 8-10% for at least another decade. Many countries have decided to adopt the Indian model as a milestone for developing their electricity sector. At any rate, these countries must first appreciate and put in proper perspective, the challenges associated with the India electricity model in order to be able to build a formidable electricity sector. There is therefore the need to install administrative and regulatory measures that would harmonize the varied interests of investors, developers and consumers in India. Also, robust and comprehensive package of policies should be prescribed for the development of hydro potentials and other renewable energy resources at a faster pace to ensure a sincere commitment towards sustainable development.

The country has also witnessed the emergence of a very strong and competent national regulator in the form of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). Despite the many challenges it inevitably faced, the CERC has emerged as a strong institution that has implemented the core constructs of the Electricity Act, 2003 with elan and has evolved a common market design that is universally accepted, including by the states. Such wide and large-scale transformation in a country of continental proportions, despite all the deep-seated challenges, is absolutely unprecedented.\nThe greatest unaddressed challenges in the Indian electricity sector lie in the states where institutions are weak and decisions are often influenced by political priorities and considerations. Two genres of state-level institutions stand on weak legs: distribution and supply licensees, and the state electricity regulatory commissions that regulate the state-level licensees. In a legal construct that is predicated on non-discriminatory open access, distribution and supply licensees are deeply conflicted in carrying out both functions while simultaneously permitting open access to third parties. It is time that these conflicts are removed and the two functions are unbundled and accorded two distinct licences. The distribution licensee, in its new avatar, can collect fair and reasonable access charges from all users, including the supply licensee(s) and other open access users, invest wisely in upgrading networks and earn reasonable profits. Arguably, the incumbent supply licensees will also be well positioned to compete with their access to a low-cost historical portfolio of contracts. At a time when building new power plants (especially conventional ones) has become very challenging, the incumbents will have great competitive advantages.

Ltd. (TJPS) speaks to Dipti Srivastava about the challenges of power sector in India and Toshiba's commitment in solving the problems through innovative technologies\nIn the past few years, in spite of various initiatives, power situation still remains one of the core challenges for India. What are the factors responsible for it?\nElectricity is one of the basic constituents for the economic growth of a country and as you said there are various initiatives taken in the country in the past few years to improve the power situation. Toshiba's major expansion of power business in India is also a result of this. One of the biggest concerns is the gap in the demand and supply of power in India. There are several barriers that pose a challenge to the Indian power sector. The first challenge is land acquisition; not only for the power sector but for any industry. The second challenge is speedy environmental clearance.\nThe third challenge is availability of coal. Half of the Indian power generation depends on coal as a source and the production of coal has not increased to match the demand. And the fourth challenge is financial crisis. Because of the recent economic slowdown, financing for new projects have become tougher, especially for Independent Power Producers (IPPs). There was no order from IPPs in the last fiscal year.\nAfter the last general elections in India, there is a huge expectation, both from the general public and the industry that things will improve. At present Power, Coal and New & Renewable Energy ministries are functioning under a single leadership. It means more focused and better co-ordination among these ministries and ultimately improvement in the power situation is expected.\nIn your opinion, how does it impact the economic growth of the nation?\nThe Indian economy is in the trajectory of upward growth. To keep up the momentum of this growth, availability of uninterrupted power supply is a must.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:9d9dab77-6a95-456c-8242-c87c9b2af01b>::chunk-7"]}, {"passage": "The importance of electricity as a prime driver of growth is very well acknowledged and in order to boost the development of power system, the Indian government has participated in a big way through creation of various corporations such as, State Electricity Boards (SEB), NTPC Limited, NHPC Limited and Power Grid Corporation Limited (PGCL), etc. However, even after this the country is facing power shortage.\nThere are many problems faced by the power sector and these need to be addressed. One of the issues plaguing the power sector in a big way is shortage of equipment. This has been a significant reason for India missing its capacity addition targets. While the shortage has been primarily in the core components of Boilers, Turbines and Generators, there has been lack of adequate supply of Balance of Plant (BOP) equipment as well. There is a shortage of construction equipment also.\nThe current power infrastructure in India is not capable of providing sufficient and reliable power supply. Some 400 million people have zero access to electricity since the grid does not reach their areas.\nAnother problem is unstable power supply. There are frequency fluctuations caused by load generation imbalances in the system and this keeps happening because consumer load keeps changing. Frequency is the most crucial parameter in the operation of AC systems. The rated frequency in India is 50.0 Hz. While the frequency should ideally be close to the rated frequency all the time, it has been a serious problem in India. Poor power quality control has knock-on effects on equipment operation, including large-scale generation capacity. Equipment damage can, of course, further compromise supply and aggravate the effects of chronic fuel shortages.\nTo summarize, Indian power sector has made considerable progress in the last decade and has evolved from a nascent market to a developing market led by policy reforms and increased private sector participation. Challenges do exist in the sector, which India has to overcome to evolve from a developing market to a matured market. Meanwhile, the gap between what can be achieved and what is currently present, uncovers a number of possibilities and opportunities for growth.\nOVER 50 YEARS WITH INDIAN POWER SECTOR\nTHE DEMAND FOR POWER IN INDIA CONTINUES TO INCREASE LEADING TO THE NEED FOR HIGH-END POWER TURBINE & GENERATORS, WHICH IS ONE OF TOSHIBA'S CORE EXPERTISE\nToshiba has been an integral part of India's power sector for decades.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:9d9dab77-6a95-456c-8242-c87c9b2af01b>::chunk-3"]}, {"passage": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to open commercial coal mining to private players is a key step towards bringing order to the country's chaotic power industry and ending the chronic blackouts that impede its economic rise. In an executive order posted on the Coal Ministry's website, the government said that any firm incorporated in India may be allowed to mine coal for their own consumption or sale, ending a 42-year-old ban.\nProgress of independent power projects has recently accelerated. The 700-megawatt Enron project at Dabhol is under construction, and two power projects have actually started generating power (the 235megawatt GVK project at Jegurupadu in Andhra Pradesh and the 208megawatt Spectrum project at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh).\nIndia is currently facing energy crisis with its major dependency on coal, crude oil imports to meet sharply growing energy needs of the country. More than 40% household lack access to electricity. There is a need for alternate energy which will not only offset the demand of conventional fossil fuel but also pave way to cleaner solution with less poisonous gases emissions. The alternate solution must be low maintenance and deliver sustained performance in adverse climatic conditions. There is a strong need to push for wider-scale implementation of public-private partnership models. The private sector has been playing a key role in generating power, and in making the desired technological interventions in energy space.\nMillions of people in India have no electricity\nThere is a whole gamut of challenging areas in the power sector that India needs to address on priority in order to meet its growth targets World over the economic growth is driven by energy, either in the form of finite resources such as coal, oil and gas or in renewable forms such as hydropower, wind, solar and biomass, or its converted form, electricity. This energy generation and consumption powers a nation's industries, vehicles, homes and offices.\nIt also has significant impact on the quality of the country's air, water, land and forest resources.

Therefore, while the sector achieved success in terms of higher electrification, improved energy efficiency and meeting of power demand before the onset of Covid-19, some discoms remained under financial stress.\nImpact of Covid-19 on the power sector: The outbreak of Covid-19 and the consequent countrywide lockdown is a once-in-a-lifetime event with a wide-ranging impact on the power sector. This impact has been in the form of a sudden reduction in demand, financial stress and disruptions in the power supply chain. However, the impact on power generation, transmission and distribution entities has been different.\nDistribution: With industrial and commercial activities coming to a halt in the first quarter of this financial year, the demand for power reduced by 25-30 per cent. The situation worsened further due to deferrals of electricity bills to customers and difficulties in collection. With the gradual opening up of industries, electricity demand is now increasing, with annual demand expected to touch pre-pandemic levels by the first quarter of financial year 2020-21. Most discoms are now recording higher online billing and collection.\nGeneration: The contraction in power demand has led to a decline in offtake and consequently, in the overall PLF of generators. How, the renewable energy sector has fared well compared to the conventional (thermal) sector and most of the decline in power generation appears to have come from the latter. A related development was an increase of 14.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in electricity volumes traded on the exchange in the first quarter of 2020-21. Another consequence of Covid-19 and its associated issues is significant delays in the resolution of stressed power projects. It is likely to cause further delays in projects under implementation, resulting in time and cost overruns.\nTransmission: With reduced power flow across the grid, transmission companies have been registering higher available transmission capacity levels across their interregional and intra-regional links. This, along with the high levels of spare power generation capacity across the country, had resulted in a glut in the secondary power markets during the initial days of the lockdown. However, the situation stabilised as generators withdrew capacities due to subdued demand and offtake from the market.\nWhat has been the industry response to the pandemic?", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:780e924f-c3e0-4910-8449-3cf9e4810a29>::chunk-1"]}], "final_prompt": "You are an accurate and reliable AI assistant that can answer questions with the help of external documents.

The central challenges identified were inadequate generation capacity, high distribution losses, and free (and, in case of many states, unmetered) farm power.\nThe first generation of power reforms, initiated at the turn of the century, involved unbundling integrated utilities by separating generation, transmission, and distribution. This, coupled with a series of regulations mandating competitive power purchases by distribution companies, attracted private investment into generation and installed capacity rose dramatically. Discoms had to purchase power from the market at competitive prices and also had to make immediate payments (and not run up dues) for those purchases. Often times, especially in the summers, the prices of spot purchases rose by multiples, leaving discoms with even bigger gap between cost of services and revenue recovery.\nThis disciplining constraints on the cost-side forced the discoms to get their acts together on the revenues side or figure out ways to bridge the gap. But addressing the revenues side meant lowering technical and commercial losses. Given pervasive theft of supply, billing and collection deficiencies, and unmetered (and free) agriculture supply the latter was 2-4 times the former. This required addressing challenges on state capacity (in billing and collection), political economy (free farm power), and a combination of both (theft of supply).\nNow these challenges are not easily addressed. So discoms came to rely on a combination of strategies to bridge the deficit. Primarily, they resorted to large-scale rationing of supply and suppression of demand, through what are called load-shedding or power-cuts. In fact, in India, “peak demand” is deceptive since it only conveys demand of the discoms and not of the consumers. Across vast swathes of North India, consumers are off-grid more hours than they have supply. Rural areas bear the brunt of these power cuts.\nAnother strategy was to finance the deficit with government subsidies (to the extent of government policy mandated subsidised supply, mainly to farmers) and borrowings. In many states, the government subsidies while sanctioned were never disbursed, forcing the discoms to borrow even more and continuously rolling them over. The Government of India periodically undertook discom debt restructuring schemes with ostensibly strict conditions on loss reduction.\n\nDocument 2: The recent nationwide power outages in India have raised serious questions about the reliability of the country’s ageing electric grid.\nHaving grown up in Chennai, I have seen firsthand, the effect of daily power cuts in the city. I can only imagine how bad things must be in other parts of the State.\nWhile it is important to invest in upgrading the current grid infrastructure, India must take a cue from Germany and Spain (recent events notwithstanding), and aggressively promote solar photovoltaic energy by the use of feed-in tariffs.\nFeed-in tariffs are a mechanism by which a renewable energy producer signs a long-term contract with a buyer (potentially the state government agencies engaged in energy generation, transmission and distribution) to supply renewable energy at a fixed rate over a fixed period of time.\nOver time, this tariff is lowered in order to encourage technological innovation and achieve grid parity (when the price of electricity from renewable sources equals that from conventional sources). This has been the most successful policy mechanism in accelerating renewable energy deployment globally. Further, this policy enables regular people to own and sell electricity generating assets.\nThe high upfront cost of solar photovoltaics is cited as the reason for their slow deployment. While this is true, it is important to know that solar panels themselves are only a small portion of the cost of an entire solar photovoltaic system.\nThe major costs relate to Balance-of-System – mounting structures, brackets, additional power electronics (inverters) and batteries – and installation labour.\nTherefore, emphasis must be placed on lowering these costs, not just the costs of the panels alone.\nIndia must make the most of its solar resources.\nSolar photovoltaics have the potential to be a driver of economic growth while helping solve the power problem.\nThe Ministry of New and Renewable Energy must look at what other developed countries have done and adopt similar policy mechanisms in order to accelerate the growth of renewable energy technologies.\n(Tejas is studying sustainable systems and energy systems engineering at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, US.)\n\nDocument 3: It is pertinent to note however, that with the on-going intensified competition in the licensed and the liberalized electrical sector, many states are beginning to pull their stocks together, shedding the complacency of monopoly to face the competition.\nIndia also faces the problem of inadequate coal and gas production as well as exploration of new fossil fuel reserves.\nIt is evident that constant power supply is essential for the growth of any nation. India has set out a target to be a global super power having the third largest GDP by 2030 and also to have a sustained economic growth of 8-10% for at least another decade. Many countries have decided to adopt the Indian model as a milestone for developing their electricity sector. At any rate, these countries must first appreciate and put in proper perspective, the challenges associated with the India electricity model in order to be able to build a formidable electricity sector. There is therefore the need to install administrative and regulatory measures that would harmonize the varied interests of investors, developers and consumers in India. Also, robust and comprehensive package of policies should be prescribed for the development of hydro potentials and other renewable energy resources at a faster pace to ensure a sincere commitment towards sustainable development. Finally, whilst the Indian model appears closest to a ‘role model’, Nigeria should only adopt what is ‘uniquely ours’ from the model and domesticate the same for our own purpose.\n\nDocument 4: Chief among the risks for mini-grid operators and investors in India is the arrival of the central utility grid to a mini-grid-serviced area – often via low-voltage distribution lines, at high cost and incurring significant network losses. Given the extremely low discom tariffs, these grid extensions – even though they often provide unpredictable and insu fficient power – are highly disruptive to DESCO project economics, despite clear customer preferences for more reliable services.\nInvestors see other risks in the mini-grid model, sometimes erroneously. REEEP’s investigations revealed significant concerns connected to customer behaviour, particularly theft and non-payment, but these issues have largely been overcome by operators.\nElectrical power is a political issue in India, as it is in most countries. Power is subsidised, and likely will be for a great many years to come. There have been encouraging signs in 2016 and 2017 of government interest in DRE mini-grids, both at state level, with the ground-breaking release of the first state mini-grid policy in Uttar Pradesh, and at the central government level, with movement towards a national mini-grid policy. Indeed, just prior to publication of this report the Modi Government announced a plan to electrify every household in India by 2019.\nThe $2.5b plan, known as Saubhagya, is both ambitious and risky, dependent as it is upon a blend of public and private financing, but relying largely on public or quasi-public institutions to deploy and maintain. It will also likely test the limits of the government in overcoming structural economic and physical barriers, as this report will show. But current incentive schemes are sub-optimal, the procedures for securing them are unclear and lack transparency, and it is unknown whether they will be available at the scale required for mini-grids to make a significant impact on the “Power for All” challenge.\nUltimately, the sector will require long-term cooperation between the public and private sectors in order to render DESCO-model mini-grid deployments viable at scale and attract sufficient amounts of domestic and international investment. Such cooperation is sensible and to be expected, given the characteristics of the rural electrification space.\nAn important consideration for securing funding is that international development cooperation agencies, development financing institutions (DFIs) and multilateral development banks (MDBs) have expressed interest in supporting climate-smart energy access in India. DRE mini-grids offer precisely this kind of power.\n\nDocument 5: India recently experienced one of the world’s worst blackouts, with 670 million citizens directly impacted. While media reports have focused on the repercussions from two days of outages, this incident illustrates a much larger, more systemic problem: the need for improved electricity governance.\nIndia’s History of Power Problems\nIndia has the world’s fifth-largest electrical system, with an installed electric capacity of about 206 gigawatts (GW). India initiated power sector reforms in the early 1990s through a range of legal, policy, and regulatory changes. Over the last two decades, some of these reforms have been impressive, but several others weren’t taken. This lack of follow-through has resulted in a growing gap between electricity demand and supply throughout the country. Recent blackouts may have shined a spotlight on this gap, but it’s a situation that’s widespread in India: Not only do 400 million Indians lack access to electricity, but electricity supply is unreliable and of poor quality even in large parts of “electrified” India. In addition to the existing demand, Indian consumers, businesses, and industries seek more electricity to power appliances, processes, and products, further exacerbating the demand-supply gap. By 2035, India’s power demand is expected to more than double.\n3 Holes in India’s Electricity Governance\nLoss and Theft: The predominant solution proffered by policymakers in India is to increase generation capacity—unmindful of the substantial technical losses due to outdated power lines, leaky cables, and poor maintenance; commercial losses due to poor metering and local politicians’ populist “free power” policies ; and rampant electricity theft caused by people hooking up wires to overhead electricity cables. Building more power plants without fixing these problems is akin to pouring water into a bucket with large holes. With India’s power plants close to 70 percent dependent on coal and natural gas, the current coal shortages and non-availability of gas haven’t helped the situation. The Planning Commission’s Working Group on Power for the 12th Plan, among other studies, have pointed to these “holes,” but so far there’s been no serious effort made to address electricity losses or theft. No doubt, there are vested interests that benefit by the business-as-usual scenario. But there is an urgent need to hold decision-makers accountable for solving these issues on a priority and not allow them to obfuscate the situation by announcing another round of new power plants.\n\nDocument 6: India's looming power crisis: An analysis\nThere are many roadblocks in unleashing the full potential of India's power sector\nThere are many roadblocks in unleashing the full potential of India's power sector\nElectricity is critical to fuel the economic growth of India. The country is on the fast trajectory of development but to keep the momentum of growth high, availability of uninterrupted power supply is a must. India needs electricity to fuel the growth of every industry, be it large-scale or smallscale, manufacturing, healthcare or education.\nThere are many roadblocks in unleashing the full potential of India's power sector. One is fuel availability concerns faced by the industry. Coal supply by Coal India Ltd (CIL) is restricted to around 65% of actual coal requirement by coal-based thermal plants, leading to increased dependence on imported coal. This results in increasing power generation costs due to limited fuel availability. Increasing operational inefficiencies and outstanding debts have led to poor financial health of state discoms. Then there are other concerns such as land acquisition which has made purchase of land for power projects very expensive. Installation of power plants in any case, requires huge investments and the land acquisition cost pushes the capex to unprofitable and unsustainable levels.\nIndia has been dependent to a large extent on energy imports to meet its national energy requirements. As per the estimates of Planning Commission, Government of India (GoI), to ensure a sustained 8% growth of the economy, by 203132 India needs to increase its primary energy supply by three to four times and its electricity generation by five to six times of the 2003-04 levels. To limit the dependency on energy imports and contribute in meeting this energy challenge, the government is also laying a lot of emphasis on energy efficiency and demand side management. Efforts are being made to increase supply from renewable sources of energy and promote energy conservation in various consumption sectors through appropriate policy interventions.\nEnergy-efficiency is extremely important and can be promoted by setting appropriate prices and this is particularly important where energy prices are rising. However, appropriate prices by themselves may not suffice and non-price incentives/disincentives are therefore also required. This includes standards of energy efficiency that are forward looking, i.e., anticipate future price changes or pollution penalties. These standards should be determined on the basis of rational considerations and must be set in an expanding range of applications, with continuous dynamic adjustment of these standards. The standards should also be effectively enforced.\n\nDocument 7: The country has about 25,000 Mw of idle and underutilised electricity generation capacity as private companies set up power plants in anticipation of high prices, Power Secretary PK Pujari said at the launch of ETEnergyworld.com.\nSurplus production was also a problem in the coal sector, Coal Secretary Anil Swarup said. \"Earlier, I was pressurised for coal deficit, now for surplus... I have coal, I have rakes, I don't have demand,\" Swarup said at a panel discussion on his sector.\nIn the renewable energy sector, the ambitious expansion of solar energy was worrying distribution companies, which had their own power generation units, but the government would resolve the matter, Renewable Energy Secretary Upendra Tripathy said.\nHe said the government was in talks with distribution companies for faster adoption of rooftop solar projects. India plans to achieve 100 Gw of solar power generation and 60 Gw of wind power by 2022.\nCurrently, installed solar capacity is around 5,700 Mw and wind over 25,000 Mw. Sector experts and officials say that the rapid expansion in renewable energy poses several challenges of transmission and grid stability as well as reluctance of state discoms to support the sector.\n\"We do understand that some discoms have a lot of opposition to rooftop solar, because the moment customers start producing their own power on their rooftops, they will not be buying from the discom anymore. But we will resolve this issue,\" he said.\nPanelists said capacity utilisation of thermal plants had fallen sharply due to sluggish industrial growth and inefficiency of state discoms. The power secretary said the demand-supply mismatch in the sector is likely to balance out in the next four to five years as industrial growth picks up.\nPujari said the average capacity utilisation of thermal power plants is 61%. While central public sector units have load utilisation of about 70% and private producers around 65%, power plants owned by states proved to be laggard by operating at 53% of their capacity. He said capacity utilisation had fallen in the small, inefficient units.\nAssociation of Power Producers Director-General Ashok Khurana said there was a need to change coal supply policy to supply coal to power plants with medium-term power purchase contracts with distribution utilities. The other speakers in the session were Sterlite Grid Vice-Chairman Pratik Agarwal and ICRA Senior Vice-Pesident Sanyasachi Majumdar.\n\nDocument 8: At the consumption end, the greatest achievement has been the extension of electricity services to all parts of the country through a programmatic approach that effectively addressed a seemingly intractable issue. The country has also witnessed the emergence of a very strong and competent national regulator in the form of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC). Despite the many challenges it inevitably faced, the CERC has emerged as a strong institution that has implemented the core constructs of the Electricity Act, 2003 with elan and has evolved a common market design that is universally accepted, including by the states. Such wide and large-scale transformation in a country of continental proportions, despite all the deep-seated challenges, is absolutely unprecedented.\nThe greatest unaddressed challenges in the Indian electricity sector lie in the states where institutions are weak and decisions are often influenced by political priorities and considerations. Two genres of state-level institutions stand on weak legs: distribution and supply licensees, and the state electricity regulatory commissions that regulate the state-level licensees. In a legal construct that is predicated on non-discriminatory open access, distribution and supply licensees are deeply conflicted in carrying out both functions while simultaneously permitting open access to third parties. It is time that these conflicts are removed and the two functions are unbundled and accorded two distinct licences. The distribution licensee, in its new avatar, can collect fair and reasonable access charges from all users, including the supply licensee(s) and other open access users, invest wisely in upgrading networks and earn reasonable profits. Arguably, the incumbent supply licensees will also be well positioned to compete with their access to a low-cost historical portfolio of contracts. At a time when building new power plants (especially conventional ones) has become very challenging, the incumbents will have great competitive advantages. The integrated distribution and supply licences arguably hinder their own performance and commercial interests. It is indeed a pity that the incumbents typically do not perceive this to be the case.\nIndependent regulation at the state level has mirrored the misplaced priorities of the state-level regulated entities. Since their inception, they have largely focused on keeping tariffs down, ignoring or downplaying the mandate of the Electricity Act, 2003 consumer service standards, ushering efficiencies in sector operations and regulating the overall sector in a fair and transparent manner.\n\nDocument 9: What Do India’s Recent Electricity Sector Reforms Mean for Renewable Energy?\n|In July, 620 million people in India were plunged into darkness during the world's biggest power outage to date. (AP // Bikas Das)|\nIn the wake of massive blackouts this past summer that spanned 20 Indian states and left half of the country’s population without power, the national cabinet approved a debt restructuring program for State Electricity Boards (SEBs) in September aimed at improving the functioning and viability of India’s electricity sector. SEB debt across all states is currently over US$35 billion, or about 2 percent of the nation’s GDP.\nSEBs are state-owned utility companies responsible for operating the electricity grid and delivering electricity to customers. SEBs buy electricity from power generators at a price negotiated through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), which they in turn sell to electricity consumers. Lack of necessary investment to improve grid infrastructure, widespread electricity theft, and low electricity prices that result in SEBs often selling power to customers at a loss are among the systemic problems in many states. Electricity losses during transmission and distribution to customers—due to grid inefficiencies, electricity theft, and illegal grid connections—account for more than 25 percent of power generated in India.\nThe cabinet-approved debt restructuring package aims at addressing some of these problems. Under the program, state governments will take on 50 percent of SEBs’ short-term liabilities over the next two to five years. The remaining 50 percent of short-term loans will be rescheduled by lenders, providing SEBs with favorable interest rates and a three-year moratorium on principal payments. SEBs have until the end of this year to sign on to the program, which will apply to debts accumulated through March 2013.\nIf the program has the desired impact, reduced debt pressure on the state utility companies will allow them to invest in much-needed infrastructure and operation improvements and revitalize the electricity sector by enabling new PPAs that are currently beyond SEBs’ financial capacities.\nIn order to qualify for the restructuring package, SEBs are required to implement several reforms aimed at improving their financial viability and provision of services. The conditions include that SEBs may not take on new short-term loans, must collect outstanding power dues from customers, and must reduce electricity losses by at least 25 percent. State governments must also regularly review electricity prices, which will likely result in price increases for consumers in order for SEBs to generate enough revenue to cover operating costs.\n\nDocument 10: A number of policy measures at national level, which could be applied concurrently, would significantly improve the framework for renewable energy in India.\nAfter all, India's rapid and enduring economic growth is intrinsically linked to the increasing consumption of energy and natural resources.\nINTERVIEW YOSHIAKI INAYAMA\nOUR MAIN FOCUS IS TO PROVIDE TURNKEY EMPCS SOLUTIONS TO THE INDIAN POWER SECTOR\nWe create 100% INDIGENOUS Power Solutions\nYoshiaki Inayama , Managing Director, Toshiba JSW Power Systems Pvt. Ltd. (TJPS) speaks to Dipti Srivastava about the challenges of power sector in India and Toshiba's commitment in solving the problems through innovative technologies\nIn the past few years, in spite of various initiatives, power situation still remains one of the core challenges for India. What are the factors responsible for it?\nElectricity is one of the basic constituents for the economic growth of a country and as you said there are various initiatives taken in the country in the past few years to improve the power situation. Toshiba's major expansion of power business in India is also a result of this. One of the biggest concerns is the gap in the demand and supply of power in India. There are several barriers that pose a challenge to the Indian power sector. The first challenge is land acquisition; not only for the power sector but for any industry. The second challenge is speedy environmental clearance.\nThe third challenge is availability of coal. Half of the Indian power generation depends on coal as a source and the production of coal has not increased to match the demand. And the fourth challenge is financial crisis. Because of the recent economic slowdown, financing for new projects have become tougher, especially for Independent Power Producers (IPPs). There was no order from IPPs in the last fiscal year.\nAfter the last general elections in India, there is a huge expectation, both from the general public and the industry that things will improve. At present Power, Coal and New & Renewable Energy ministries are functioning under a single leadership. It means more focused and better co-ordination among these ministries and ultimately improvement in the power situation is expected.\nIn your opinion, how does it impact the economic growth of the nation?\nThe Indian economy is in the trajectory of upward growth. To keep up the momentum of this growth, availability of uninterrupted power supply is a must.\n\nDocument 11: The importance of electricity as a prime driver of growth is very well acknowledged and in order to boost the development of power system, the Indian government has participated in a big way through creation of various corporations such as, State Electricity Boards (SEB), NTPC Limited, NHPC Limited and Power Grid Corporation Limited (PGCL), etc. However, even after this the country is facing power shortage.\nThere are many problems faced by the power sector and these need to be addressed. One of the issues plaguing the power sector in a big way is shortage of equipment. This has been a significant reason for India missing its capacity addition targets. While the shortage has been primarily in the core components of Boilers, Turbines and Generators, there has been lack of adequate supply of Balance of Plant (BOP) equipment as well. There is a shortage of construction equipment also.\nThe current power infrastructure in India is not capable of providing sufficient and reliable power supply. Some 400 million people have zero access to electricity since the grid does not reach their areas.\nAnother problem is unstable power supply. There are frequency fluctuations caused by load generation imbalances in the system and this keeps happening because consumer load keeps changing. Frequency is the most crucial parameter in the operation of AC systems. The rated frequency in India is 50.0 Hz. While the frequency should ideally be close to the rated frequency all the time, it has been a serious problem in India. Poor power quality control has knock-on effects on equipment operation, including large-scale generation capacity. Equipment damage can, of course, further compromise supply and aggravate the effects of chronic fuel shortages.\nTo summarize, Indian power sector has made considerable progress in the last decade and has evolved from a nascent market to a developing market led by policy reforms and increased private sector participation. Challenges do exist in the sector, which India has to overcome to evolve from a developing market to a matured market. Meanwhile, the gap between what can be achieved and what is currently present, uncovers a number of possibilities and opportunities for growth.\nOVER 50 YEARS WITH INDIAN POWER SECTOR\nTHE DEMAND FOR POWER IN INDIA CONTINUES TO INCREASE LEADING TO THE NEED FOR HIGH-END POWER TURBINE & GENERATORS, WHICH IS ONE OF TOSHIBA'S CORE EXPERTISE\nToshiba has been an integral part of India's power sector for decades.\n\nDocument 12: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to open commercial coal mining to private players is a key step towards bringing order to the country's chaotic power industry and ending the chronic blackouts that impede its economic rise. In an executive order posted on the Coal Ministry's website, the government said that any firm incorporated in India may be allowed to mine coal for their own consumption or sale, ending a 42-year-old ban.\nProgress of independent power projects has recently accelerated. The 700-megawatt Enron project at Dabhol is under construction, and two power projects have actually started generating power (the 235megawatt GVK project at Jegurupadu in Andhra Pradesh and the 208megawatt Spectrum project at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh).\nIndia is currently facing energy crisis with its major dependency on coal, crude oil imports to meet sharply growing energy needs of the country. More than 40% household lack access to electricity. There is a need for alternate energy which will not only offset the demand of conventional fossil fuel but also pave way to cleaner solution with less poisonous gases emissions. The alternate solution must be low maintenance and deliver sustained performance in adverse climatic conditions. There is a strong need to push for wider-scale implementation of public-private partnership models. The private sector has been playing a key role in generating power, and in making the desired technological interventions in energy space.\nMillions of people in India have no electricity\nThere is a whole gamut of challenging areas in the power sector that India needs to address on priority in order to meet its growth targets World over the economic growth is driven by energy, either in the form of finite resources such as coal, oil and gas or in renewable forms such as hydropower, wind, solar and biomass, or its converted form, electricity. This energy generation and consumption powers a nation's industries, vehicles, homes and offices.\nIt also has significant impact on the quality of the country's air, water, land and forest resources. For growth to be sustainable, it must be both resource efficient and environmentally-safe.\nIn India, the demand for electricity has always been more than the supply.\n\nDocument 13: The first step towards this goal is demanding accurate estimates of electricity losses, as well as public disclosure of efforts being taken to address them.\nA Lack of Accountability: India’s transmission network needs strengthening in order to efficiently deliver the generated electricity from power plants located in different parts of the country to millions of consumers. Each state in India has its own transmission agency, and these are networked into one of five regional grids. Over the last decade, India has embarked on a project to join the five regional grids and establish a national grid. The plan sounds good in theory, but it requires a high level of discipline in order to work. Each state government needs to coordinate with the others to ensure no one is drawing too much power or impacting another’s allocated electricity. The blame game that followed the recent blackout showcases the fact that this communication and coordination just isn’t happening yet. Also, there is really no one accountable for managing the grid, pointing to a serious accountability vacuum.\nLack of a Holistic Governance Approach: India does not have a holistic approach to electricity planning or implementation. Generation, transmission, and distribution planning (and investments in each of them) happen independent of each other; renewable energy planning takes place outside of conventional electricity planning; and service to on-grid consumers and off-grid consumers happen separately–all of which highlights the absence of an over-arching electricity governance framework. This situation has caused ad hoc and lopsided planning, with no public disclosure of information about efforts to close the electricity demand-supply gap. Plus, no one agency or institution anywhere in the country is accountable for the failure to provide affordable, reliable, and quality electricity.\nImproving India’s Electricity Governance\nThis list certainly isn’t exhaustive—several other interlinked problems contribute to the malaise affecting India’s power sector, from bad monsoons and water scarcity to inefficient electrical appliances. There are solutions to some of these concerns through improved technology (such as isolating and responding to grid problems and enhancing power plants’ efficiency) and innovative policies (like holistic planning approaches and incentivizing grid discipline), but addressing the accountability and governance issues are key to improving India’s power sector.\nWRI’s Electricity Governance Initiative (EGI) is a network of civil society organizations working to promote transparent, inclusive, and accountable decision-making in the electricity sector in several countries, including India. EGI’s 2006 assessment of India’s power sector identified a range of core electricity governance problems in India.\n\nDocument 14: With its vision document, Vision 2024, India’s Ministry of Power is charting a way forward for the country’s power sector. And a central part of this vision involves the private sector. The Need for Private Sector Participation in India’s Electricity Distribution Sector explains how shifting focus to increasing private sector participation and investments in India’s energy distribution business could lead to improved financial viability and sustainability. You’ll learn:\n- The seven goals outlined in the Vision 2024 document.\n- The issues inhibiting competition in India’s power sector.\n- The international precedents India could customize for its needs.\nDownload the paper to explore the possible roadmap India could take to involving the private sector in national power distribution.\n\nDocument 15: Moreover, the sector has been plagued by issues such as the poor financial health of discoms, rising receivables and sporadic fuel supply constraints. Therefore, while the sector achieved success in terms of higher electrification, improved energy efficiency and meeting of power demand before the onset of Covid-19, some discoms remained under financial stress.\nImpact of Covid-19 on the power sector: The outbreak of Covid-19 and the consequent countrywide lockdown is a once-in-a-lifetime event with a wide-ranging impact on the power sector. This impact has been in the form of a sudden reduction in demand, financial stress and disruptions in the power supply chain. However, the impact on power generation, transmission and distribution entities has been different.\nDistribution: With industrial and commercial activities coming to a halt in the first quarter of this financial year, the demand for power reduced by 25-30 per cent. The situation worsened further due to deferrals of electricity bills to customers and difficulties in collection. With the gradual opening up of industries, electricity demand is now increasing, with annual demand expected to touch pre-pandemic levels by the first quarter of financial year 2020-21. Most discoms are now recording higher online billing and collection.\nGeneration: The contraction in power demand has led to a decline in offtake and consequently, in the overall PLF of generators. How, the renewable energy sector has fared well compared to the conventional (thermal) sector and most of the decline in power generation appears to have come from the latter. A related development was an increase of 14.5 per cent on a year-on-year basis in electricity volumes traded on the exchange in the first quarter of 2020-21. Another consequence of Covid-19 and its associated issues is significant delays in the resolution of stressed power projects. It is likely to cause further delays in projects under implementation, resulting in time and cost overruns.\nTransmission: With reduced power flow across the grid, transmission companies have been registering higher available transmission capacity levels across their interregional and intra-regional links. This, along with the high levels of spare power generation capacity across the country, had resulted in a glut in the secondary power markets during the initial days of the lockdown. However, the situation stabilised as generators withdrew capacities due to subdued demand and offtake from the market.\nWhat has been the industry response to the pandemic?\n\nQuestion: What are the main challenges India faces in its power sector regarding electricity access and supply?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "India faces several challenges in its power sector regarding electricity access and supply. These challenges include inadequate generation capacity, high distribution losses, and free or unmetered farm power. Additionally, there are issues with technical and commercial losses, pervasive theft of supply, and billing and collection deficiencies. The power sector also grapples with the political economy of free farm power and the need for state capacity improvements in billing and collection.\n\nThe challenges in India's power sector significantly impact the overall economy and development of India. These issues lead to a fragile financial health of the power sector, with accumulated losses reaching Rs 2.9 lakh crore or three per cent of GDP in 2013. The high distribution losses and free farm power have remained unresolved, contributing to the poor financial health of state discoms and hindering investment in better services.\n\nThe power sector's challenges exacerbate the country's energy security issues, which are a major constraint to its capacity to generate power. The slow pace of tariff reforms is hindering infrastructure investment at the state level, and the centralized model of power generation, transmission, and distribution is growing more costly to maintain. The blackout and shortage of power are hampering India's economic growth and its capacity for growth.\n\nInadequate power supply affects small and large-scale industries, leading to increased costs, idle capacity, and difficulties in accessing raw materials. Entrepreneurs are forced to borrow money from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates, and small-scale industries face challenges in competing with larger, better-equipped units.\n\nThe impact of these challenges extends beyond the power sector, affecting the overall economy and development. The lack of reliable electricity supply impacts businesses, leading to inefficiencies and reduced competitiveness in the global market. The inability to meet energy needs hampers economic growth and the country's capacity for growth.\n\nAddressing these challenges requires a comprehensive approach that includes improving generation capacity, reducing distribution losses, enhancing financial health of discoms, and implementing effective governance and technology solutions."}
{"id": 30, "question": "What are some differences between Indian and Mexican chili peppers in cooking?", "passages": [{"passage": "Mexican cooking has incorporated some Old World spices like cinnamon and cloves, but its heart is clearly in its native chiles, used in different combinations and ways in different dishes. These chiles don’t just add flavour, but also colour, like the rich deep red of anchos or the dark chocolaty red of pasillas. They also give texture to dishes because the skins of varieties like anchos contain pectin, the natural gelling agent that helps jams to set, which gives sauces based on these chiles a wonderful smoothness without the gluey texture of thickeners like cornflour.\nTo cook Mexican food these chiles are imperative, yet it is hard to make Indian cooks understand this. For us chiles are to be used for heat only, while other flavours are added with other spices. I am willing to bet that almost none of the restaurants here that serve rajma covered with cheese and served with corn chips and call it ‘Mexican’ food have any idea of these different types of chiles. The few places that have tried with fine dining with Mexican cusine —- like the Taj President’s El Mexicana in Mumbai — never last because we find the food too similar to Indian food and the subtleties of the chiles, instead of being appreciated for themselves, are just seen as further sign of its shortcomings.\nA few importers are now bringing in authentic Mexican chiles, along with readymade salsas and ingredients like canned tomatillos, tart green fruit that look like tomatoes, but add a very distinctive acid bite to Mexican salsas. Recently for a party I made five different salsas, each from a different chile, and they were a huge hit, with everyone exclaiming at the difference in flavours. Watching my friends gobble down Indian khakras loaded with Mexican salsas made me wonder if there might be some hope for Mexican chiles in India after all.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:0387f503-e405-44a0-8f9f-2b960be70524>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "I’ve always been fascinated at the parallels between classic Indian cuisine and regional Mexican.

It should not be confused with the Fresno Bell pepper. It is often confused with the jalapeño pepper but has thinner walls, often has milder heat, and takes less time to mature. It is however a New Mexico chile, which is genetically distinct from the jalapeño and it grows point up, rather than point down as with the jalapeño. The fruit starts out bright green changing to orange and red as fully matured. A mature Fresno pepper will be conical in shape, 2 inches long, and about 1 inch in diameter at the stem. The plants do well in warm to hot temperatures and dry climates with long sunny summer days and cool nights. They are very cold-sensitive and disease resistant, reaching a height of 24 to 30 inches.\nThe Scoville rating of the Serrano pepper is 10,000 to 23,000. They are typically eaten raw and have a bright and biting flavor that is notably hotter than the jalapeño pepper.

These chiles don’t just add flavour, but also colour, like the rich deep red of anchos or the dark chocolaty red of pasillas. They also give texture to dishes because the skins of varieties like anchos contain pectin, the natural gelling agent that helps jams to set, which gives sauces based on these chiles a wonderful smoothness without the gluey texture of thickeners like cornflour.\nTo cook Mexican food these chiles are imperative, yet it is hard to make Indian cooks understand this. For us chiles are to be used for heat only, while other flavours are added with other spices. I am willing to bet that almost none of the restaurants here that serve rajma covered with cheese and served with corn chips and call it ‘Mexican’ food have any idea of these different types of chiles. The few places that have tried with fine dining with Mexican cusine —- like the Taj President’s El Mexicana in Mumbai — never last because we find the food too similar to Indian food and the subtleties of the chiles, instead of being appreciated for themselves, are just seen as further sign of its shortcomings.\nA few importers are now bringing in authentic Mexican chiles, along with readymade salsas and ingredients like canned tomatillos, tart green fruit that look like tomatoes, but add a very distinctive acid bite to Mexican salsas. Recently for a party I made five different salsas, each from a different chile, and they were a huge hit, with everyone exclaiming at the difference in flavours. Watching my friends gobble down Indian khakras loaded with Mexican salsas made me wonder if there might be some hope for Mexican chiles in India after all.\n\nDocument 2: I’ve always been fascinated at the parallels between classic Indian cuisine and regional Mexican. Onion, garlic, cumin, chilie, cilantro, cinnamon, cloves, tomatoes… they all speak Spanish and Hindi. The similarities also involve preparation techniques: the roasting of spices, the layering of ingredients in a sauce. Aloo Channa cooked with onions and tomatoes is typical Northern Indian. The guajillos, corn, and chocolate are purely Mexican. Most of the labor goes into the guajillo sauce, which is cooked in a way very similar to curry pastes. I’d also guess that this would work with chunks of cooked birdie substituting for the potatoes.\n2 tbs olive oil\n1 medium yellow onion\n2 tomatoes, peeled, seeded, cubed\n1 small sweet onion (Maui, Vidalia, Walla-Walla)\n1-1/2 cup Guajillo sauce (see below)\n1-2 tbs sweet Mexican chocolate, crumbled (Abuelita is a common brand)\n1-2/3 c cooked garbanzo beans\n2 potatoes (preferably Yukon Gold or red waxy), boiled\n1 c corn kernels\n2-3 tbs chopped cilantro\nTo a hot saute pan, add the olive oil and onions. Cook, stirring fequently, until onions are medium-light brown. Then add the tomato and continue stirring and cooking until they wilt and brown slightly. Stir in the guajillo sauce, bring to a simmer. Then add the chocolate, and stir until it is well-dispersed. Add the vegetables, then simmer, covered, for about 5 minutes. Adjust salt, remove from heat, and stir in cilantro.\nGarnish with strips of roasted green chile and cilantro leaves. Serve with rice and home-made tortillas.\nGuajillo Sauce – Taken from “Rick Bayless’s Mexican Kitchen”, a great cookbook.\n6 garlic cloves, unpeeled\n4 oz dried guajillos\n1 tsp dried oregano\n1/4 tsp black pepper\n1/4 tsp cumin\n3-1/2 c stock\n1-1/2 tbs olive oil\nOn a griddle, roast the garlic cloves on all sides until they are soft and there are black spots on the skin. Put aside.\n\nDocument 3: Chili peppers are capsicums and are in the same family as bell peppers and paprika pods. They range in flavor from rich and sweet to fiery and hot. The important thing for you to remember is to combine the heat of chili peppers with other spices so the finished dish will have a full bodied flavor.\nHere is an description of the most commonly used peppers in the world. Many are readily available others are only available by mail order. Here is a listing of some of the most popular chili peppers. The spiciness is rated in scoville units. The bigger the number the hotter the chili. These chilies are available usually dried.\nThis chili is Turkish in origin and has a ancho like flavor with a little more heat and tartness. Crush and put in a jar and shake on pizza and spaghetti. Allepo is great on grilled meats, steaks and chops. Use in your tuna salad and on your deviled eggs. 10,000 scoville units.\nLarge, juicy, dark purple Mexican chili pods. These peppers are the most commonly used in Mexico, and are the backbone of dishes such as traditional red chili and tamales. To make a flavorful ancho chili oil; Chop 3 peppers into 1 inch chunks and simmer in 3 cups of corn oil for 20 minutes. Let cool, strain and store in an airtight container. Drizzle over tacos, tamales or other dishes where you want a little zip. 3,000 scoville units.\nThese peppers have a round shape with rich deep flavor, and are pretty spicy. In Mexican cooking they are used from everything from chili, tacos and mole. 11,000 scoville units.\nThis chili is usually found in powdered form. It is very spicy.Use judiciously. 40,000 scoville units.\nThese are small super hot red Mexican chilies. They are also known as birds eye chilies. These chilies are also common to Thailand. Use with caution. These chilies are also used whole in Asian cooking. 140,000 scoville units.\nChipolte peppers are smoked jalapeño peppers. They are available either dried in canned in adobo sauce. They are rich smoky and fairly hot. They are wonderful added to chili or red chili sauces. 15,000 scoville units.\n\nDocument 4: The different varieties are unusually sweet compared to other onions due to the low amount of sulfur in the soil in which Vidalia onions are grown.\nTraditional Chili isn’t the same without the garlic. Garlic is such a personal decision, do you like a little or a lot?\nI suggest using around 6 cloves. Just enough to flavor the chili without over powering the dish.\nThe poblano (Capsicum annuum) is a mild chili pepper originating in the state of Puebla, Mexico. Dried, it is called ancho or chile ancho, from the Spanish word ancho (\"wide\").\nWhile poblanos tend to have a mild flavor, occasionally and unpredictably they can have significant heat. Different peppers from the same plant have been reported to vary substantially in heat intensity. The ripened red poblano is significantly hotter and more flavorful than the less ripe, green poblano.\nFRESNO CHILE PEPPER\nThe Fresno Chili Pepper (/ˈfrɛznoʊ/ FREZ-noh) is a medium-sized cultivar of Capsicum annuum. It should not be confused with the Fresno Bell pepper. It is often confused with the jalapeño pepper but has thinner walls, often has milder heat, and takes less time to mature. It is however a New Mexico chile, which is genetically distinct from the jalapeño and it grows point up, rather than point down as with the jalapeño. The fruit starts out bright green changing to orange and red as fully matured. A mature Fresno pepper will be conical in shape, 2 inches long, and about 1 inch in diameter at the stem. The plants do well in warm to hot temperatures and dry climates with long sunny summer days and cool nights. They are very cold-sensitive and disease resistant, reaching a height of 24 to 30 inches.\nThe Scoville rating of the Serrano pepper is 10,000 to 23,000. They are typically eaten raw and have a bright and biting flavor that is notably hotter than the jalapeño pepper. Serrano peppers are also commonly used in making pico de gallo and salsa, as the chili is particularly fleshy compared to others, making it ideal for such dishes.\nIt is the second most used chili pepper in Mexican cuisine and has a fruity flavor profile.\n\nDocument 5: Chili peppers, a spicy fruit featured in cuisines around the world, were used in Mexico long before going global, as was the agave-derived distilled drink tequila. This week, the Museum’s Adventures in the Global Kitchen series presents Tequila and Chilies, which will include a conversation with Juan Carlos Aguirre, the executive director of Mano a Mano: Mexican Culture Without Borders. Aguirre, who will be providing samplings of chili-based dishes from across Mexico alongside tequila from Richard Sandoval Restaurants, recently offered a quick history lesson about the ubiquitous chili pepper.\nHow long has the chili pepper been an integral ingredient in Mexican cooking?\nChili peppers have been used in Mexican cuisine for thousands of years. They were one of the first plants in the region to be “domesticated.”\nHow did the chili pepper spread throughout the world?\nChili peppers are originally from the Americas and were incorporated into different cuisines around world after the continent was discovered by Europeans. The Philippines and Mexico were once part of the Spanish Empire, and the chili pepper was exported from Mexico to the Philippines and then all over Asia. So its use in Indian, Chinese, Malaysian, and other Asian cuisines actually comes from the Americas.\nWhat’s one of the more surprising ways in which chili peppers have been used?\nBefore Mexico was conquered, chocolate was the drink of Aztec royalty, and the chocolate had chili pepper in it. Europeans took the chocolate to Europe and added milk and other ingredients to make it sweet.\nWhat is the mission of your organization, Mano a Mano: Mexican Culture Without Borders?\nThe organization was founded 12 years ago to celebrate and preserve Mexican traditions and pass them on to a new generation. We do different workshops, crafts, music, visual arts, and culinary arts. The idea is that through the arts, people will learn about Mexico in a more authentic way.\n\nDocument 6: Ancho chili powder is milder than paprika.\nWhile both have similar smoky and earthy flavors, ancho chili powder has a more intense heat as it is spicier than paprika.\nAncho chili powder is an essential ingredient in many dishes.\nBut when a recipe calls for it and you don’t have any on hand, there are several great options to substitute for ancho chili powder you can use.\nRed chili powder, pasilla chili powder, paprika, chipotle powder, cayenne powder and ginger powder are great alternatives.\nAll these spices have unique flavors and you can use it in various ways, so experiment with different combinations to find the perfect flavor for your dish!\n\nDocument 7: - 1 What red chillies are used in Indian cooking?\n- 2 What are Indian peppers called?\n- 3 Is Carolina Reaper found in India?\n- 4 Is Jalapeno spicy for Indians?\n- 5 Which chilli is best?\n- 6 What pepper makes Indian food spicy?\n- 7 Do Indians use peppers?\n- 8 What is the world’s hottest pepper?\n- 9 Are green chiles the same as poblano peppers?\n- 10 Can Carolina Reaper kill you?\n- 11 What are the top 20 hottest peppers?\n- 12 Is the Dragon’s Breath pepper real?\n- 13 Which jalapeno is spicy?\n- 14 What is jalapeno called in India?\n- 15 What is the spiciest thing in the world?\nWhat red chillies are used in Indian cooking?\nThe Hot Red Indian These include Bird’s eye chilli (dhani), Byadagi (kaddi and daggi), Ellachipur Sannam, Guntur Sannam, Hindpur, Jwala, Kanthari White, Kashmiri Chilli, Madhya Pradesh Sannam, Madras Puri, Nagpur, Nalchetti, Ramnad Mundu, Sangli Sannam, Sattur, Mundu, Tadappally and Tomato Chilli.\nWhat are Indian peppers called?\nIndian Green Chili Peppers Hari Mirch is the Hindi word for green chili, where “Hari = green” and “Mirch = chili”. Fresh, slender Indian green chiles are used in curries, stews, pickled or eaten raw as a condiment. The white spongy membrane of the green chili near the seeds, also called placenta, carries that heat.\nIs Carolina Reaper found in India?\nThe Carolina Reaper is said to be a cross between Sweet Habanero and Naga Viper chillies. And, the crossbreed may have an Indian connection, too. The Naga Viper was created by an English chilli farmer. The Carolina Reaper was certified as the world’s hottest chili pepper by the Guinness World Records in the year 2013.\nIs Jalapeno spicy for Indians?\nYes, they are. Are they very spicy? No, at least not on average. I love jalapenos and even use them in place of green bell pepper (capsicum) in many recipes.\nWhich chilli is best?\n\nDocument 8: 10: A shallow and large cooking pot\nWhats the difference between a regular pot and the one I just described?

You need to learn and to buy all these different chiles and test them. You need to smell and touch them. It's not like you could throw them in a pan and you are ready to go. Mexican cooking is not about that. Nowadays you have these great bottled things over the years. You could throw some chicken in the pan and add this sprinkling of something and it tastes fine. But you need to buy them (chiles) and understand them. They are your base of the flavor profile.

Speaking of chili pepper, it’s no secret that poblano chili is a very versatile chili pepper mainly because of its mild spiciness and slightly earthy flavor. You may probably know or have heard about poblano pepper because it is loved and used by many professional chefs and food enthusiasts.\nPoblano chili is a very popular pepper, but it isn’t always available for some unknown reasons, especially when you desperately need it. So I had to improvise to solve this problem, I came up with some adequate substitutes for poblano chili, and I’m going to share them with you. If you don’t know about this Mexican chili, you should also read this article to get aquatinted.\nWhat is Poblano Chili?\nThe poblano pepper is a mild variety of chili pepper that originated from Puebla in Mexico. The young poblano peppers are green in color, and they have a close resemblance to pasilla pepper. Most stores in the United States get them mixed up. On the other hand, an older poblano pepper has dark red skin, hotter, and packs more flavor than the young green pepper.\nThe plant can grow up to 64cm vertically with several stems, and the fruit is about 7cm to 15cm long and 5cm to 8cm in width. It takes about 200 days to fully mature from when it was planted.\nPoblano Chili Nutrition Facts\nUses of Poblano Chili in recipes\nThe poblano pepper is a versatile chili and can be used in Mexican cuisines and a wide range of dishes. It is particularly popular in the United States and can be in abundance in the American States close to Mexico.\nThis Mexican pepper gets its full glory during the Mexican Independence celebration. It is incorporated into a chiles en nogada, which specifically calls for green, white, and red ingredients that correspond to the national flag.\nThe poblano pepper is usually consumed when it is green in color, it can either be dried, used in sauces, coated in whipped egg, and fried or stuffed and because of its mild flavor, you can also eat it them whole.\n\nDocument 13: Chili Pepper - Jalapeno Summer Heat F1 Hybrid\nThe pizza pepper!

Indian cuisine often uses milder chili peppers like the green chili (Hari Mirch) for heat, while Mexican cooking incorporates a wide range of chili peppers, from mild to extremely hot, such as poblano, ancho, and chipotle peppers. Poblano peppers, originating from Puebla, Mexico, are mild chili peppers frequently used in dishes like chile rellenos, where they are filled with cheese and meat. Ancho chilies are dried poblano peppers, acquiring a sweet, fruity flavor due to their late picking and drying process, making them ideal for mole sauces.\n\nThe flavor profiles of specific chili peppers, such as poblano, ancho, and green chili (Hari Mirch), differ significantly in Indian and Mexican cooking. Poblano peppers are mild, with a heat level of 1,000-2,000 Scoville Heat Units, while green chilies used in Indian cuisine can have a much higher heat level, ranging from 15,000-30,000 Scoville units. Ancho peppers, being dried poblano peppers, have a sweet, fruity flavor, which is different from the heat-focused usage of green chilies in Indian cuisine.\n\nIn Mexican cooking, poblano peppers are often roasted and peeled to remove the waxy texture, or dried and sold as ancho peppers, which are popular for their sweet, fruity flavor. In Indian cuisine, green chilies are used for heat, often balanced with other spices, while Mexican dishes highlight the distinct flavors and colors of different chili peppers. This reflects the diverse culinary traditions and preferences of each culture.\n\nIn summary, poblano peppers in Mexican cuisine are known for their mild flavor and are often used in dishes like chile rellenos and mole sauces, while ancho peppers, which are dried poblano peppers, have a sweet, fruity flavor. In Indian cuisine, green chilies are used more for heat, contrasting with the flavor-focused use of chili peppers in Mexican cooking. These differences highlight the unique culinary traditions and preferences of each culture."}
{"id": 31, "question": "How does a diamond's carat weight affect its price?", "passages": [{"passage": "Most people express diamond carat weight in percentages, such as quarter carat, half carat, three quarter carat, 1-carat, and so forth. They also guesstimate the value of your ring, or how much you spent on it by what it weighs.\nThe reality however is that other factors such as diamond color, diamond clarity and diamond cut quality also have a significant effect upon the price of a diamond and thus it is common for smaller diamonds to cost more than larger ones.\nWithin the diamond industry there are several ways of expressing diamond carat weight. A one carat diamond weighs 100 points, just like there are 100 pennies in a dollar, and would be expressed in written form as 1.00 carats.\nThe term \"points” does not refer to the number of facet junctures that are created by the facet structure of a diamond.\nWhat Is a Point of Carat Weight?\nIt is a representation of weight which originated in Egypt when carob seeds were used to determine the weight of a gem stone. When describing a half carat diamond weighing 0.52 carats, a store owner might refer to it as a \"52 pointer” instead of saying it weighs \"zero (point) five two carats)”.\nIn the old days, diamond wholesalers frequently referred to diamonds that weighed about one-quarter carat, or its multiples, as being so many grains. A grain roughly equals twenty five points or one-quarter carats, expressed as 0.25 carats. A 0.74 carat diamond, for example, would be referred to as a three-grainer.\nA 1.25 carat diamond would be called a five grainer and so on, today the stone would be described as \"a carat twenty five” or a \"carat and a quarter” but a few of the old timers still talk amongst themselves in terms of grains just to see if us young pups are up to speed.\nKeeping It Legal:\nThe Federal Trade Commission has set forth guidelines concerning the proper representation of carat weight to the public. The diamond's actual weight must fall within two points (0.02 carats) of the fractional representation.\nFor instance, a diamond represented as weighing one-carat should fall within a range of 0.98 to 1.02 carats. A half-carat diamond should weigh between 0.48 and 0.52 carats, and so on.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:5807cab7-344c-4336-8384-e096fb4655a0>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Clarity is graded on a scale from Flawless to Included (FL, IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1, I2, I3). Higher clarity grades correspond to a higher value.\nThe cut of a diamond plays a crucial role in determining its appearance and value. A well-cut diamond will have optimal light performance, displaying superior fire, sparkle, and brilliance. Diamonds with excellent cuts are often more expensive than those with lower cut grades.\nFluorescence in a diamond refers to its ability to emit visible light when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\nAlthough fluorescence can sometimes cause a diamond to appear hazy or cloudy, it does not always negatively impact the diamond's appearance. In some cases, it can improve the diamond's appearance by making a lower color grade diamond appear whiter.\nSymmetry refers to the alignment and balance of a diamond's facets. Diamonds with excellent symmetry will have well-aligned facets, leading to improved light performance and greater overall beauty. A diamond with poor symmetry may have misaligned facets that can negatively impact its sparkle and value.\nThe polish of a diamond refers to the smoothness of its surface. A well-polished diamond will exhibit minimal surface blemishes, leading to a cleaner appearance and better light performance. Poorly polished diamonds can have surface irregularities that detract from their beauty and value.\nDiamond Price Per Carat\nThe price per carat of a diamond can vary significantly based on factors such as weight, cut, color, and clarity. Diamonds are typically priced on a per-carat basis, with a price list that may include discount or premium rates depending on the specific quality of a diamond.\nFor example, a 1 ct radiant cut diamond ring may have a different price per carat compared to a 2 ct princess cut solitaire engagement ring due to the differences in cut, carat weight, and other factors. It's essential to be aware of these price ranges to make an informed decision when purchasing a diamond.\nThe matrix breakdown for diamond prices often includes the following categories:\n- Carat weight: The size of the diamond, measured in carats, significantly impacts the price per carat. Generally, larger diamonds command a higher price per carat.\n- Cut: The cut of a diamond refers to its shape and proportions. A well-cut diamond reflects light beautifully, thus raising its value.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:c3640a71-d61d-45ce-87db-ad113028be03>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "Diamonds are sold by carat (which is written as ct.), the unit of weight, which is perceived by many in terms of size. The word \"carat\" derives its name from the carob seeds that people used in olden times to counterweight their balance scales. These seeds are so homogeneous in shape and weight that even today's sophisticated instruments cannot detect more than three one-thousandths of a difference between them. Currently one carat is equivalent to 0.2 grams or 0.007 ounces (of about the weight of a paper clip). One more way of expressing the weight is by means of points. One carat is equivalent to 100 points hence a 0.25 carat diamond can well be referred to as a 25 point diamond. The size of a diamond is relative to its carat weight. Basically when a crude diamond is cut and polished it loses about 2/3 of its total carat weight.\nA point which also needs to be considered is that carat weight a diamond never defines its actual shape. It is even possible to have two diamonds which have similar carat weight but have an entirely different look, which is due to the disparity in their cut and shape. Also, it is rare to find bigger rough gems of high quality in contrast to the smaller rough gems as a single 2 carat diamond can be pricier than 2 one carat diamonds of the equal quality.\nIt should be noted that when the carat size of a diamond increases, its price also increases at a growing rate. Bigger the diamond, progressively more rare it is. Chances are very few that one in a million mined rough stones would be large enough to produce a finished 1 carat diamond. That is the reason when the carat weight increases one has to naturally pay more not only on the whole, but on a price-per-carat basis as well. So whenever you plan to buy a perfect piece for yourself or even as a gift certain points that you need to keep in mind are the budget, taste and preference, as well as the style and setting of the ornament.\nCarat of a diamond determines the weight of the diamond irrespective of the size of the diamond or appearance of the diamond. In between two diamonds of same carats, one may appear to be bigger than the other depending on the specific shape of the diamond.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:f89d17ed-7883-4590-be44-4e5a6e84e3bb>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Here's a table of size and weight ranges:\nCarat Fractions and Their Decimal Equivalents:\nFraction Decimal Equivalent\n|1/10||=||.09 ─ .11|\n|1/8||=||.12 ─ .13|\n|1/7||=||.14 ─ .15|\n|1/6||=||.16 ─ .17|\n|1/5||=||.18 ─ .22|\n|1/4||=||.23 ─ .28|\n|1/3||=||.29 ─ .36|\n|3/8||=||.37 ─ .44|\n|1/2||=||.45 ─ .58|\n|5/8||=||.59 ─ .68|\n|3/4||=||.69 ─ .82|\n|7/8||=||.83 ─ .94|\n|1.0||=||.95 ─ 1.05|\nRemember, all diamonds are not created equal. Two diamonds of equal Carat Weight may vary substantially in price due to their Cut, Color and Clarity. Also, a diamond's weight can be 'hidden' in different parts of the stone.\nFor example, you can have a well-cut diamond, whose weight is distributed properly, a diamond that is cut too shallow to make it wider and heavier, but not the most brilliant, or one that is cut too deeply, to add weight to the bottom of the stone - again compromising its ability to radiate maximum brilliance. Visit Cut for more information.\nThe bottom line\nThe carat weight of a diamond is an extremely important determining factor in its value. Diamonds are valued on a per-carat basis. For example, a diamond of exceptionally high quality may sell for $20,000 per carat, while one of lesser quality may sell for $1,000 per carat. So, a three-carat stone could be $60,000 or $3,000, depending on its per-carat price.\nDiamond values also increase disproportionately as the size of the stone increases. In other words, a two-carat stone will not necessarily cost twice per carat than a one-carat stone. It could cost much more, since diamonds are rarer in larger sizes.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:37329014-7aa6-41c0-aecc-beaa3f825294>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "The value of a diamond is based on the following four C’s\nCarat - Refers to the weight of a diamond\nThe carat weight of a diamond is probably the most essential factor when understanding the value of a diamond.\nA carat weight (1.00 carat = 100 points) is the standard unit used to measure and define its weight.\nAs the carat weight increases so does its rarity and its value.\nColour - Refers to the degree of which a diamond is colourless.\nThe colour of a diamond is graded from D to Z, most buyers are interested in the white range, as a diamond size increases its\ncolour becomes more noticeable.

Generally, the price of a diamond per carat increases as the carat size increases. However, this increase in price is not always linear, and there may be disproportionate jumps in cost per carat depending on the size of the diamond.\nWhat factors contribute to a diamond's price per carat?\nApart from carat size, several factors contribute to a diamond's price per carat, including its color, clarity, and cut. Diamonds with a higher color and clarity grade are more valuable, leading to higher prices per carat. The cut of a diamond also plays a significant role, as more desirable cuts may command higher prices.\nHow does diamond color and clarity relate to its price?\nThe color and clarity of a diamond are both vital factors in determining its price. Diamonds with less color (graded on a scale of D to Z) are more expensive, as they are considered more brilliant and rare. Clarity is graded based on the amount and location of inclusions (internal) and blemishes (external) present in the diamond. Flawless diamonds are the most expensive, whereas diamonds with more visible imperfections will be priced lower.\nAre there significant price differences between various cuts of diamonds?\nYes, different cuts of diamonds can have a considerable impact on their price. Some cuts are considered more desirable due to their ability to reflect light and create brilliance. For example, the popular round brilliant cut typically commands a higher price per carat than other cuts, such as the princess or emerald cut. The price difference can be attributed to factors like demand, cutting complexity, and the proportion of rough diamond utilized.\nHow do market trends impact diamond prices?\nMarket trends significantly impact diamond prices. Factors such as consumer demand, market availability, and economic fluctuations can influence the price of diamonds.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:c3640a71-d61d-45ce-87db-ad113028be03>::chunk-5"]}, {"passage": "In determining carat weight, consider the following factors:\n– The size of her finger\n– The size of the ring’s setting\n– Your overall budget\nOftentimes, diamond size or carat weight is an important factor in people’s final choice.

Each of these factors have their own effect on the brilliance and fire of a diamond.\nThe colour of a diamond is measured on a scale from D (entirely colourless) upwards. Perfectly colourless diamonds are sought after for their brilliance and are valued higher than diamonds of lower colour grades.\nDiamonds are a naturally occurring gemstone, and as such can exhibit physical imperfections (called inclusions) which influence their clarity. A diamond with large, or several, inclusions will allow less light to pass through it and produce less of the \"fire\" that an internally flawless diamond will.\nCut & Shape\nThe cut of a diamond has the greatest effect on the sparkle of a diamond. The better a diamond is cut, the more light is reflected back out and the more glittering brilliance it will radiate.\nThe cut of a diamond is different from its shape, which represents the visual form of a diamond, the most classic example being the round brilliant cut, but including other such shapes as princess cut, cushion cut, oval cut, pear cut and more.\nThe weight of a diamond is expressed in \"carats\" and not to be confused with the measurement of gold purity (for example 18ct white gold).\nOne carat is equivalent to 0.2 grams and is divided into \"points\" - a 50 point diamond weighs 0.1g and has a 0.50 carat weight.\nWhen a diamond is cut, the cutter maps the largest diamond possible from the rough stone with the least physical imperfections that affect its colour, clarity and integrity.\nAll diamonds over half a carat in weight from Anthonys Manufacturing Jewellers are laser inscribed and certified by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:fa11c6b9-daca-4930-8ddd-ca713b796437>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Precise artistry and workmanship are required to fashion a stone so its proportions, symmetry and polish deliver the magnificent return of light only possible in a diamond.\nTo put it simply, diamond carat weight measures how much a diamond weighs.

A jeweller may describe the weight of a diamond below one carat by its ‘points’ alone. For instance, the jeweller may refer to a diamond that weighs 0.25 carats as a ‘twenty-five pointer.’ Diamond weights greater than one carat are expressed in carats and decimals. A 1.08 carat stone would be described as ‘one point oh eight carats.’\nAll else being equal, diamond price increases with diamond carat weight because larger diamonds are rarer and more desirable.

They also guesstimate the value of your ring, or how much you spent on it by what it weighs.\nThe reality however is that other factors such as diamond color, diamond clarity and diamond cut quality also have a significant effect upon the price of a diamond and thus it is common for smaller diamonds to cost more than larger ones.\nWithin the diamond industry there are several ways of expressing diamond carat weight. A one carat diamond weighs 100 points, just like there are 100 pennies in a dollar, and would be expressed in written form as 1.00 carats.\nThe term \"points” does not refer to the number of facet junctures that are created by the facet structure of a diamond.\nWhat Is a Point of Carat Weight?\nIt is a representation of weight which originated in Egypt when carob seeds were used to determine the weight of a gem stone. When describing a half carat diamond weighing 0.52 carats, a store owner might refer to it as a \"52 pointer” instead of saying it weighs \"zero (point) five two carats)”.\nIn the old days, diamond wholesalers frequently referred to diamonds that weighed about one-quarter carat, or its multiples, as being so many grains. A grain roughly equals twenty five points or one-quarter carats, expressed as 0.25 carats. A 0.74 carat diamond, for example, would be referred to as a three-grainer.\nA 1.25 carat diamond would be called a five grainer and so on, today the stone would be described as \"a carat twenty five” or a \"carat and a quarter” but a few of the old timers still talk amongst themselves in terms of grains just to see if us young pups are up to speed.\nKeeping It Legal:\nThe Federal Trade Commission has set forth guidelines concerning the proper representation of carat weight to the public. The diamond's actual weight must fall within two points (0.02 carats) of the fractional representation.\nFor instance, a diamond represented as weighing one-carat should fall within a range of 0.98 to 1.02 carats. A half-carat diamond should weigh between 0.48 and 0.52 carats, and so on.\n\nDocument 2: Clarity is graded on a scale from Flawless to Included (FL, IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1, I2, I3). Higher clarity grades correspond to a higher value.\nThe cut of a diamond plays a crucial role in determining its appearance and value. A well-cut diamond will have optimal light performance, displaying superior fire, sparkle, and brilliance. Diamonds with excellent cuts are often more expensive than those with lower cut grades.\nFluorescence in a diamond refers to its ability to emit visible light when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\nAlthough fluorescence can sometimes cause a diamond to appear hazy or cloudy, it does not always negatively impact the diamond's appearance. In some cases, it can improve the diamond's appearance by making a lower color grade diamond appear whiter.\nSymmetry refers to the alignment and balance of a diamond's facets. Diamonds with excellent symmetry will have well-aligned facets, leading to improved light performance and greater overall beauty. A diamond with poor symmetry may have misaligned facets that can negatively impact its sparkle and value.\nThe polish of a diamond refers to the smoothness of its surface. A well-polished diamond will exhibit minimal surface blemishes, leading to a cleaner appearance and better light performance. Poorly polished diamonds can have surface irregularities that detract from their beauty and value.\nDiamond Price Per Carat\nThe price per carat of a diamond can vary significantly based on factors such as weight, cut, color, and clarity. Diamonds are typically priced on a per-carat basis, with a price list that may include discount or premium rates depending on the specific quality of a diamond.\nFor example, a 1 ct radiant cut diamond ring may have a different price per carat compared to a 2 ct princess cut solitaire engagement ring due to the differences in cut, carat weight, and other factors. It's essential to be aware of these price ranges to make an informed decision when purchasing a diamond.\nThe matrix breakdown for diamond prices often includes the following categories:\n- Carat weight: The size of the diamond, measured in carats, significantly impacts the price per carat. Generally, larger diamonds command a higher price per carat.\n- Cut: The cut of a diamond refers to its shape and proportions. A well-cut diamond reflects light beautifully, thus raising its value.\n\nDocument 3: In determining carat weight, consider the following factors:\n– The size of her finger\n– The size of the ring’s setting\n– Your overall budget\nOftentimes, diamond size or carat weight is an important factor in people’s final choice. If this is the case, in order to fit within a very strict budget, one may choose to find a diamond that has a good cut, but move down on clarity & color slightly in order to find a large and“clean”stone that fits the budget.\nIt is also worth noting that diamond prices have differences as they jump from one full carat size to the next. For example, a 2.95 carat diamond will see a significant jump in price when compared to a 3.01 carat diamond with similar grading. This is because the stone’s total value is determined based from a “per carat” value determined by its characteristics.\nA woman’s finger size can also affect how large a diamond appears. For example, the same diamond on a woman with a size 3.5 finger will make a 2 carat round solitaire look much larger than the same engagement ring on a woman with a size 9 ring finger. In determining the perfect diamond, let us help you find the perfect balance as you weigh the many different characteristics of the diamonds you have to choose from.\n\nDocument 4: Diamonds are sold by carat (which is written as ct.), the unit of weight, which is perceived by many in terms of size. The word \"carat\" derives its name from the carob seeds that people used in olden times to counterweight their balance scales. These seeds are so homogeneous in shape and weight that even today's sophisticated instruments cannot detect more than three one-thousandths of a difference between them. Currently one carat is equivalent to 0.2 grams or 0.007 ounces (of about the weight of a paper clip). One more way of expressing the weight is by means of points. One carat is equivalent to 100 points hence a 0.25 carat diamond can well be referred to as a 25 point diamond. The size of a diamond is relative to its carat weight. Basically when a crude diamond is cut and polished it loses about 2/3 of its total carat weight.\nA point which also needs to be considered is that carat weight a diamond never defines its actual shape. It is even possible to have two diamonds which have similar carat weight but have an entirely different look, which is due to the disparity in their cut and shape. Also, it is rare to find bigger rough gems of high quality in contrast to the smaller rough gems as a single 2 carat diamond can be pricier than 2 one carat diamonds of the equal quality.\nIt should be noted that when the carat size of a diamond increases, its price also increases at a growing rate. Bigger the diamond, progressively more rare it is. Chances are very few that one in a million mined rough stones would be large enough to produce a finished 1 carat diamond. That is the reason when the carat weight increases one has to naturally pay more not only on the whole, but on a price-per-carat basis as well. So whenever you plan to buy a perfect piece for yourself or even as a gift certain points that you need to keep in mind are the budget, taste and preference, as well as the style and setting of the ornament.\nCarat of a diamond determines the weight of the diamond irrespective of the size of the diamond or appearance of the diamond. In between two diamonds of same carats, one may appear to be bigger than the other depending on the specific shape of the diamond.\n\nDocument 5: Diamonds are renowned for their beauty and durability, making them a popular choice for jewelry, particularly engagement rings.

The better a diamond is cut, the more light is reflected back out and the more glittering brilliance it will radiate.\nThe cut of a diamond is different from its shape, which represents the visual form of a diamond, the most classic example being the round brilliant cut, but including other such shapes as princess cut, cushion cut, oval cut, pear cut and more.\nThe weight of a diamond is expressed in \"carats\" and not to be confused with the measurement of gold purity (for example 18ct white gold).\nOne carat is equivalent to 0.2 grams and is divided into \"points\" - a 50 point diamond weighs 0.1g and has a 0.50 carat weight.\nWhen a diamond is cut, the cutter maps the largest diamond possible from the rough stone with the least physical imperfections that affect its colour, clarity and integrity.\nAll diamonds over half a carat in weight from Anthonys Manufacturing Jewellers are laser inscribed and certified by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).\n\nDocument 11: Here's a table of size and weight ranges:\nCarat Fractions and Their Decimal Equivalents:\nFraction Decimal Equivalent\n|1/10||=||.09 ─ .11|\n|1/8||=||.12 ─ .13|\n|1/7||=||.14 ─ .15|\n|1/6||=||.16 ─ .17|\n|1/5||=||.18 ─ .22|\n|1/4||=||.23 ─ .28|\n|1/3||=||.29 ─ .36|\n|3/8||=||.37 ─ .44|\n|1/2||=||.45 ─ .58|\n|5/8||=||.59 ─ .68|\n|3/4||=||.69 ─ .82|\n|7/8||=||.83 ─ .94|\n|1.0||=||.95 ─ 1.05|\nRemember, all diamonds are not created equal. Two diamonds of equal Carat Weight may vary substantially in price due to their Cut, Color and Clarity. Also, a diamond's weight can be 'hidden' in different parts of the stone.\nFor example, you can have a well-cut diamond, whose weight is distributed properly, a diamond that is cut too shallow to make it wider and heavier, but not the most brilliant, or one that is cut too deeply, to add weight to the bottom of the stone - again compromising its ability to radiate maximum brilliance. Visit Cut for more information.\nThe bottom line\nThe carat weight of a diamond is an extremely important determining factor in its value. Diamonds are valued on a per-carat basis. For example, a diamond of exceptionally high quality may sell for $20,000 per carat, while one of lesser quality may sell for $1,000 per carat. So, a three-carat stone could be $60,000 or $3,000, depending on its per-carat price.\nDiamond values also increase disproportionately as the size of the stone increases. In other words, a two-carat stone will not necessarily cost twice per carat than a one-carat stone. It could cost much more, since diamonds are rarer in larger sizes.\n\nDocument 12: Precise artistry and workmanship are required to fashion a stone so its proportions, symmetry and polish deliver the magnificent return of light only possible in a diamond.\nTo put it simply, diamond carat weight measures how much a diamond weighs. A metric “carat” is defined as 200 milligrams. Each carat is subdivided into 100 ‘points.’ This allows very precise measurements to the hundredth decimal place. A jeweller may describe the weight of a diamond below one carat by its ‘points’ alone. For instance, the jeweller may refer to a diamond that weighs 0.25 carats as a ‘twenty-five pointer.’ Diamond weights greater than one carat are expressed in carats and decimals. A 1.08 carat stone would be described as ‘one point oh eight carats.’\nAll else being equal, diamond price increases with diamond carat weight because larger diamonds are rarer and more desirable. However, two diamonds of equal carat weight can have very different values (and prices) depending on three other factors of the diamond 4Cs.\n-Information provided by the GIA (Gemological Institute of America)-\n\nDocument 13: Two diamonds of equal Carat Weight may vary substantially in price due to their Cut, Color and Clarity. Also, a diamond’s weight can be ‘hidden’ in different parts of the stone. For example, you can have a well-cut diamond, whose weight is distributed properly, a diamond that is cut too shallow to make it wider and heavier, but not the most brilliant, or one that is cut too deeply, to add weight to the bottom of the stone – again compromising its ability to radiate maximum brilliance.\n\nDocument 14: This is important again\nwhen looking at the cut of a diamond. A stone could\nweigh one carat but because it is poorly cut the stone\nmay look much smaller or much larger than it should\nbut neither will have the sparkle and brilliance of\na well proportioned stone. Diamonds are valued based\non demand and their rarity. Larger stones are much more\nrare than smaller ones, so the per carat price of a\nlarge stone is more than the per carat price of a small\nstone of the same quality.\n\nDocument 15: The value of a diamond is based on the following four C’s\nCarat - Refers to the weight of a diamond\nThe carat weight of a diamond is probably the most essential factor when understanding the value of a diamond.\nA carat weight (1.00 carat = 100 points) is the standard unit used to measure and define its weight.\nAs the carat weight increases so does its rarity and its value.\nColour - Refers to the degree of which a diamond is colourless.\nThe colour of a diamond is graded from D to Z, most buyers are interested in the white range, as a diamond size increases its\ncolour becomes more noticeable. Sought-after colours with the highest value are in the D-F range (colourless) a\ndifference between one colour grade to the next is almost unnoticeable to the eye.\nClarity - Refers to the presence of inclusions in a diamond.\nThe clarity refers to the optical quality of a diamond. Diamonds are formed within earth and it is only natural fo them to\nhave certain imperfection within them, these are called inclusions. This is what makes each diamond unique.\nDiamonds with the least imperfections are rare and have a higher value.\nCut - Refers to the angles and proportions of a diamond.\nThe cut is important to a diamond's overall appearance. It refers to how well diamond is cut which results in a diamond internal\nlight reflection and its brilliance. The shape of a diamond is closely connected to the above and while\nbeing symmetrical round diamond reflects light the best.\n\nDocument 16: The so-called fancy-cut diamonds include the princess, cushion, heart, pear, marquise radiant, emerald and oval. The jewellery shops Birmingham boasts will offer a wide variety possibly including some other rarer cuts as well.\nCarat is the weight measurement for the mass of the diamond. Be aware that this means that some diamonds could be denser and weigh more, even though they are technically the same size. 1 Carat is typically akin to 200 milligrams and as you would imagine, the more carats, the more the diamond is going to cost. Large diamonds are quite rare and also subject to high demand which inflates their price a great deal.\n\nQuestion: How does a diamond's carat weight affect its price?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "A diamond's carat weight significantly affects its price, as larger diamonds are rarer and more desirable, leading to a higher price per carat. The price per carat typically increases with the weight of the diamond, but this increase is not always linear, with disproportionate jumps in cost per carat depending on the size of the diamond. Other factors such as color, clarity, and cut also play a crucial role in determining the price of a diamond. For example, a 2 carat diamond will not necessarily cost twice as much as a 1 carat diamond due to these additional factors. Additionally, the shape of the diamond can influence its perceived size and value, with certain cuts appearing larger than others of the same carat weight. Therefore, when considering the price of a diamond, it is essential to take into account not only its carat weight but also its color, clarity, cut, and shape.\n\nTo effectively engage with questions and inquiries, it is crucial to create an environment that encourages open communication. This can be achieved by inviting questions, providing clear channels for inquiries, and expressing a willingness to address any concerns. Additionally, ensuring that the process for submitting questions is straightforward and accessible is vital.\n\nBy integrating these insights, we ensure a comprehensive understanding of both diamond pricing and effective communication strategies."}
{"id": 32, "question": "How big is Leonardo da Vinci's Last Supper painting, and where is it located?", "passages": [{"passage": "Leonardo da Vinci is one of the most well-known names in the world because of the many contributions he made to modern society.\nLeonardo da Vinci is most famous for his paintings titled Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, however, he is also famous for being a polymath. A polymath is a person with a wide-ranging knowledge of different subjects. In da Vinci’s case, these subjects were painting, drawing, sculpting, science, engineering, architecture, and anatomy. He contributed much more than art to the modern world.\nRead more below about Leonardo da Vinci’s famous pieces of art, his contribution to science, and his inventions.\nLeonardo da Vinci’s Art\nThe reason Leonardo da Vinci is so famous is that he painted what is arguably the most famous painting in the world. The Mona Lisa, which sits on display at The Louvre Museum, is probably the most recognizable painting in existence.\nIt has been referenced in an almost countless number of pop culture pieces, including the film Mona Lisa Smile and The Da Vinci Code book and film. Leonardo Da Vinci even appeared as a minor character in the 1998 film Ever After where the Prince chases down some bandits who stole the Mona Lisa from da Vinci.\nThe Mona Lisa is also in theory the most valuable painting in the world. When it was assessed for insurance purposes in 1962, it was valued at around $100 million, which is equivalent to $850 million today factoring in inflation.\nHowever, Mona Lisa is only one of the many famous and highly valuable paintings that Leonardo da Vinci created in his lifetime. In fact, in 2017, the sale of his painting Salvator Mundi became the highest price ever paid for a painting when it sold for $450.3 million.\nHe has some other very famous paintings as well. One of those would be The Last Supper.\nFrom 1495 to 1498, da Vinci worked to paint this massive piece of artwork that was commissioned to be displayed in the dining hall at the monastery Santa Maria Delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. When it was complete it measured 230 inches by 350 inches.\nThe Last Supper depicts Jesus with his twelve disciples at the dinner table for his last meal before his crucifixion. The scene is meant to represent the story of the Last Supper of Jesus as it is told in the Gospel of John in the Bible.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:b547d888-e6ce-47c1-a95c-4401bb09b6c5>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Located on the wall of the dining room of the former Dominican convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, exactly in the refectory of the convent, the Last Supper, a late 15th-century mural painting by the great Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the most famous and fascinating, most studied and reproduced and the subject of many legends and controversies. Commissioned by Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan and painted by the master artist between 1495 and 1498, the coloured plaster of the enormous fresco measuring 15 by 29 feet (4.6 x 8.8 meters), covers the entire wall of the refectory, although the room was not a refectory at the time that Leonardo painted it.\nInstead of using tempera on wet plaster, the usual method of fresco painting, Leonardo painted it on dry plaster, as he sought a greater detail and luminosity than could be achieved with traditional fresco and it resulted in a more varied palette. In fact, traces of gold and silver foils have been found which testify to the artist's eagerness to make the figures much more realistic. He chose to seal the stone wall with a double layer of dried plaster, composed of gesso (gypsum prepared with glue), pitch, and mastic. After that, he added an undercoat of white lead to enhance the brightness of the oil and tempera that was applied on top. Unfortunately, his experiment did not work, as the painted plaster began to flake off the wall almost immediately. Various authorities have struggled to restore it ever since.\nThe layout of the fresco is largely horizontal. All the figures are set behind the large table, which is seen in the foreground of the image. The painting is also largely symmetrical with the same number of figures on either side of Jesus.\nThe Last Supper is the visual interpretation of the artist of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels, depicting the evening before Christ was to be betrayed by one of his disciples. He gathered them all together to eat and to tell them that he knew what was going to happen soon. The fresco depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one of his disciples would betray him before the sunrise and the different reactions of horror, shock and anger of the twelve apostles.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:09052286-1942-48fe-b88a-587975f8ab99>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)\nThe Last Supper (in Italian:Il Cenacolo or L’Ultima Cena) is a late 15th century mural painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie.\nCommissioned to Leonardo Da Vinci by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, The Last Supper was part of an overall renovation of the church and its convent buildings, and was commenced around 1495.\nIn the painting, which represents the scene of The Last Supper of Jesus with his disciples, as told in the Gospel of John, 13:21, Leonardo depicted the consternation that occurred among the Twelve Disciples when Jesus announced that one of them would betray him.\nSanta Maria of the Grazie\nSanta Maria della Grazie (“Holy Mary of Grace“) is a church and Dominican convent in Milan, northern Italy, included in the Unesco World Heritage sites list.\nThe church contains the mural of The Last Supper, which is in the refectory of the convent.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:034e5cbc-d39c-4cd4-be13-f3843030a581>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Toward the end of his life in 1508, he accompanied King Louis XII of France to Milan where he stayed to practice anatomy and other scientific fields until 1512. When the French lost Milan, he moved to Rome, where he remained until his death in 1519.\nAfter his death, his close friend Francis I said of him, “there had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo da Vinci, not so much about painting, sculpture, and architecture, as that, he was a very great philosopher.”\nLeonardo’s artistic works are considerable and have had a monumental influence on not only the artistic scene of the day but are still studied and analyzed to date. Two of his pieces, The Last Supper and Mona Lisa are not only his most famous but rank as some of the most famous pieces of art of all time.\nThe Last Supper was painted for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria Della Grazie in Milan. It is the final meal that Jesus and his disciples ate before the crucifixion and the piece specifically showcases the moment where Jesus has just told his followers, “one of you will betray me.” The time after uttering these words is the moment the painting encapsulates – which we can see by the expressions of the disciples. The work showcases Da Vinci’s total mastery of form, characterization and setting in a blazing fire of talent.\nThe painting itself is massive – it stretches 180 in x 350 in and covers an entire end wall of the dining hall in Santa Maria Delle Grazie. It, unfortunately, has been damaged and, despite restoration efforts, very little of the painting remains today.\nMona Lisa or La Gioconda, is arguably one of the most famous paintings in the world, to this day.

The different reactions of anger and shock are vividly portrayed by Leonardo da Vinci. The most striking feature of this painting is how Leonardo places the vanishing point of the perspective in the Last Supper, where the vanishing point is behind the right temple of Christ.\nThis points exactly to the location of the center of the composition. The Last Supper also shows the love of the symmetry of Leonardo. He uses a horizontal layout here. The supper table is put in the foreground of the image of Christ. All the apostles are behind, with the same number of figures on each side of Christ. This shows the symmetrical composition of da Vinci.\nFurther, the perspective that da Vinci used highlights the positions of the figures and the architectural features in the composition. It is no wonder that this painting figures prominently among Leonardo da Vinci's famous paintings. In this work, a large scale wall painting, Leonardo as an artist had no prior experience in mural painting.\nExperimental pigments were applied on the dry plaster wall. The usual technique with frescoes was that pigments were mixed on wet plaster. Hence, problems cropped up such as paint flaking off the wall. Today, the current masterpiece that remains has little of the original version.\nThis painting is the first painting by the twenty-year-old Leonardo da Vinci. Its composition is traditional in the portrayal of the figures, with the angel kneeling on the left and Mary seated at the right. A lectern is between them.\nThe scene is in an architectural setting with a landscape in the background. The composition resembles the medieval iconographic presentations of the Annunciation. The sfumato technique of da Vinci, his dramatic interplay of light and dark, his aerial perspective are not evident.\nHence, these painterly techniques are still in their developmental phase in the artistic palette of Leonardo da Vinci as an innovator. The painting is nevertheless regarded as the achievement of a master. It is considered as a showcase of the pictorial talent of Leonardo da Vinci and therefore is a forerunner of Leonardo da Vinci''s famous paintings.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:69e163ae-5f00-4e0a-869d-29eab9db9e54>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "When you go, make sure you turn around to appreciate the painting at the opposite end of the room.

Well, what’s left on the table gives us a bit of a clue – plates of fish, bread, salt and wine. Perhaps, because it was a Passover meal, they had eaten bowls of slow cooked beans – cholent – and had olives with a minty herb known as hyssop. Doubtless, they ate a salad of bitter herbs with pistacchio and date choroset, a chunky fruit and nut paste.\nThe disciples, in groups of three, are physically linked by their gestures, but seem not at all interested in the table and its remains. Judas, deep in shadow, is looking rather withdrawn and taken aback by the sudden revelation of his plan. He is clutching a small bag, perhaps signifying the silver given to him as payment to betray Jesus, or perhaps a reference to his role as treasurer. He is also tipping over the salt cellar. This may be related to the expression to \"betray the salt\" meaning to betray one's Master. He is the only person to have his elbow on the table and his head is also horizontally the lowest of anyone in the painting.

In Tintoretto’s The Last Supper, Jesus is shown with a glow about him that instantly grabs the viewer’s attention and leaves no question about which person is Jesus. Each of Jesus’ disciples, except for Judas whom is kneeling on the opposite side of the table from the others, also has a small glow around their head that sets them apart from the other people in the painting. In addition to Jesus and his disciples, there are several other people in the room preparing the meal for Jesus and his disciples. Not only has Tintoretto portrayed the physical realm, he has also included a spiritual realm. Several angels are shown flying in the room, which along with Jesus’ illumination depicts his divine nature.\nThis amazing work of art was painted from 1592 to 1594 (Matthews, Platt, and Noble 396).

A polymath is a person with a wide-ranging knowledge of different subjects. In da Vinci’s case, these subjects were painting, drawing, sculpting, science, engineering, architecture, and anatomy. He contributed much more than art to the modern world.\nRead more below about Leonardo da Vinci’s famous pieces of art, his contribution to science, and his inventions.\nLeonardo da Vinci’s Art\nThe reason Leonardo da Vinci is so famous is that he painted what is arguably the most famous painting in the world. The Mona Lisa, which sits on display at The Louvre Museum, is probably the most recognizable painting in existence.\nIt has been referenced in an almost countless number of pop culture pieces, including the film Mona Lisa Smile and The Da Vinci Code book and film. Leonardo Da Vinci even appeared as a minor character in the 1998 film Ever After where the Prince chases down some bandits who stole the Mona Lisa from da Vinci.\nThe Mona Lisa is also in theory the most valuable painting in the world. When it was assessed for insurance purposes in 1962, it was valued at around $100 million, which is equivalent to $850 million today factoring in inflation.\nHowever, Mona Lisa is only one of the many famous and highly valuable paintings that Leonardo da Vinci created in his lifetime. In fact, in 2017, the sale of his painting Salvator Mundi became the highest price ever paid for a painting when it sold for $450.3 million.\nHe has some other very famous paintings as well. One of those would be The Last Supper.\nFrom 1495 to 1498, da Vinci worked to paint this massive piece of artwork that was commissioned to be displayed in the dining hall at the monastery Santa Maria Delle Grazie in Milan, Italy. When it was complete it measured 230 inches by 350 inches.\nThe Last Supper depicts Jesus with his twelve disciples at the dinner table for his last meal before his crucifixion. The scene is meant to represent the story of the Last Supper of Jesus as it is told in the Gospel of John in the Bible.\n\nDocument 2: Located on the wall of the dining room of the former Dominican convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie in Milan, exactly in the refectory of the convent, the Last Supper, a late 15th-century mural painting by the great Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, is one of the most famous and fascinating, most studied and reproduced and the subject of many legends and controversies. Commissioned by Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan and painted by the master artist between 1495 and 1498, the coloured plaster of the enormous fresco measuring 15 by 29 feet (4.6 x 8.8 meters), covers the entire wall of the refectory, although the room was not a refectory at the time that Leonardo painted it.\nInstead of using tempera on wet plaster, the usual method of fresco painting, Leonardo painted it on dry plaster, as he sought a greater detail and luminosity than could be achieved with traditional fresco and it resulted in a more varied palette. In fact, traces of gold and silver foils have been found which testify to the artist's eagerness to make the figures much more realistic. He chose to seal the stone wall with a double layer of dried plaster, composed of gesso (gypsum prepared with glue), pitch, and mastic. After that, he added an undercoat of white lead to enhance the brightness of the oil and tempera that was applied on top. Unfortunately, his experiment did not work, as the painted plaster began to flake off the wall almost immediately. Various authorities have struggled to restore it ever since.\nThe layout of the fresco is largely horizontal. All the figures are set behind the large table, which is seen in the foreground of the image. The painting is also largely symmetrical with the same number of figures on either side of Jesus.\nThe Last Supper is the visual interpretation of the artist of an event chronicled in all four of the Gospels, depicting the evening before Christ was to be betrayed by one of his disciples. He gathered them all together to eat and to tell them that he knew what was going to happen soon. The fresco depicts the next few seconds in this story after Christ dropped the bombshell that one of his disciples would betray him before the sunrise and the different reactions of horror, shock and anger of the twelve apostles.\n\nDocument 3: Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)\nThe Last Supper (in Italian:Il Cenacolo or L’Ultima Cena) is a late 15th century mural painting by Leonardo da Vinci in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie.\nCommissioned to Leonardo Da Vinci by the Duke of Milan, Ludovico Sforza, The Last Supper was part of an overall renovation of the church and its convent buildings, and was commenced around 1495.\nIn the painting, which represents the scene of The Last Supper of Jesus with his disciples, as told in the Gospel of John, 13:21, Leonardo depicted the consternation that occurred among the Twelve Disciples when Jesus announced that one of them would betray him.\nSanta Maria of the Grazie\nSanta Maria della Grazie (“Holy Mary of Grace“) is a church and Dominican convent in Milan, northern Italy, included in the Unesco World Heritage sites list.\nThe church contains the mural of The Last Supper, which is in the refectory of the convent.\n\nDocument 4: Toward the end of his life in 1508, he accompanied King Louis XII of France to Milan where he stayed to practice anatomy and other scientific fields until 1512. When the French lost Milan, he moved to Rome, where he remained until his death in 1519.\nAfter his death, his close friend Francis I said of him, “there had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo da Vinci, not so much about painting, sculpture, and architecture, as that, he was a very great philosopher.”\nLeonardo’s artistic works are considerable and have had a monumental influence on not only the artistic scene of the day but are still studied and analyzed to date. Two of his pieces, The Last Supper and Mona Lisa are not only his most famous but rank as some of the most famous pieces of art of all time.\nThe Last Supper was painted for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria Della Grazie in Milan. It is the final meal that Jesus and his disciples ate before the crucifixion and the piece specifically showcases the moment where Jesus has just told his followers, “one of you will betray me.” The time after uttering these words is the moment the painting encapsulates – which we can see by the expressions of the disciples. The work showcases Da Vinci’s total mastery of form, characterization and setting in a blazing fire of talent.\nThe painting itself is massive – it stretches 180 in x 350 in and covers an entire end wall of the dining hall in Santa Maria Delle Grazie. It, unfortunately, has been damaged and, despite restoration efforts, very little of the painting remains today.\nMona Lisa or La Gioconda, is arguably one of the most famous paintings in the world, to this day. The elusive smile on the face of the woman, front, and center, has brought a mystery to the world that remains unsolved after more than five hundred years. The shadows hint at so much and offer so little, and indeed, the shadowy quality the piece is known for came to be called, “sfumato,” or “Leonardo’s smoke.”\nThe Mona Lisa also plays on the religious culture of the time; the woman pictured bearing a strong resemblance to depictions of the Virgin Mary herself, who was seen as the ideal of womanhood for the time.\n\nDocument 5: Tickets for The Last Supper: Skip The Line\nThe ultimate Da Vinci experience - available on Wednesdays and Saturdays\n- See a late 15th-century mural painting by Da Vinci in the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie – it's one of the world's most famous paintings!\n- The church was heavily damaged in an Allied bomb attack during WWII.

The different reactions of anger and shock are vividly portrayed by Leonardo da Vinci. The most striking feature of this painting is how Leonardo places the vanishing point of the perspective in the Last Supper, where the vanishing point is behind the right temple of Christ.\nThis points exactly to the location of the center of the composition. The Last Supper also shows the love of the symmetry of Leonardo. He uses a horizontal layout here. The supper table is put in the foreground of the image of Christ. All the apostles are behind, with the same number of figures on each side of Christ. This shows the symmetrical composition of da Vinci.\nFurther, the perspective that da Vinci used highlights the positions of the figures and the architectural features in the composition. It is no wonder that this painting figures prominently among Leonardo da Vinci's famous paintings. In this work, a large scale wall painting, Leonardo as an artist had no prior experience in mural painting.\nExperimental pigments were applied on the dry plaster wall. The usual technique with frescoes was that pigments were mixed on wet plaster. Hence, problems cropped up such as paint flaking off the wall. Today, the current masterpiece that remains has little of the original version.\nThis painting is the first painting by the twenty-year-old Leonardo da Vinci. Its composition is traditional in the portrayal of the figures, with the angel kneeling on the left and Mary seated at the right. A lectern is between them.\nThe scene is in an architectural setting with a landscape in the background. The composition resembles the medieval iconographic presentations of the Annunciation. The sfumato technique of da Vinci, his dramatic interplay of light and dark, his aerial perspective are not evident.\nHence, these painterly techniques are still in their developmental phase in the artistic palette of Leonardo da Vinci as an innovator. The painting is nevertheless regarded as the achievement of a master. It is considered as a showcase of the pictorial talent of Leonardo da Vinci and therefore is a forerunner of Leonardo da Vinci''s famous paintings.\n\nDocument 7: When you go, make sure you turn around to appreciate the painting at the opposite end of the room. I was so overwhelmed by the pale beauty of the Michelangelo that I did not give due attention to this other painting. This wall of the refectory is covered by the Crucifixion fresco by Giovanni Donato da Montorfano, to which Leonardo added figures of the Sforza family in tempera.\nLeonardo’s painting, as we all know, represents the scene of the Last Supper of Jesus with his apostles, as it is told in the Gospel of John, 13:21. Leonardo has depicted the consternation that occurred among the twelve disciples when Jesus announced that one of them would betray him.\nPhoto Credit: Italian Renaissance.org.\nLeonardo da Vinci, Last Supper, 1498, tempera and oil on plaster (Santa Maria della Grazie, Milan); (photo: public domain)\nBut what are they eating at this important last dinner together as a group of friends? Well, what’s left on the table gives us a bit of a clue – plates of fish, bread, salt and wine. Perhaps, because it was a Passover meal, they had eaten bowls of slow cooked beans – cholent – and had olives with a minty herb known as hyssop. Doubtless, they ate a salad of bitter herbs with pistacchio and date choroset, a chunky fruit and nut paste.\nThe disciples, in groups of three, are physically linked by their gestures, but seem not at all interested in the table and its remains. Judas, deep in shadow, is looking rather withdrawn and taken aback by the sudden revelation of his plan. He is clutching a small bag, perhaps signifying the silver given to him as payment to betray Jesus, or perhaps a reference to his role as treasurer. He is also tipping over the salt cellar. This may be related to the expression to \"betray the salt\" meaning to betray one's Master. He is the only person to have his elbow on the table and his head is also horizontally the lowest of anyone in the painting. Peter looks angry and is holding a knife pointed away from Christ, perhaps foreshadowing his violent reaction in Gethsemane during Jesus' arrest. The youngest apostle, John, appears to swoon, it’s all very dramatic.\n\nDocument 8: The image of the village of Saint-Rémy under a trademark intense, swirling blue night sky has become equivalent to the name of the famed Dutch painter. It’s definitely not the only piece by van Gogh that can be universally recognized by quite a lot of people and, in fact, one of his latter works stands as one of the most expensive works of art ever sold. This is truthfully ironic given the fact that van Gogh has only sold one painting while he was alive. This definitely says a lot about his legacy.\nPhoto Courtesy of Wikipedia\nThe Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci\nEveryone knows this painting, and there have been numerous interpretations of the iconic scene unfolding in this legendary da Vinci piece. Painted near the end of the 15th century, the piece depicts the scene of The Last Supper, where Jesus gathered all of his Twelve Apostles to announce that one of them (spoilers, it’s Judas) would betray him. However, almost as famous as the image itself are the controversies surrounding it. While many people claim that the person seated to Jesus’ right is John the Apostle, several theories have surfaced which claim that was Mary Magdalene. All of this led to numerous media works that used the theory as a focal point, the most famous being Da Vinci’s Code.\nPhoto Courtesy of IreneFGoros\nThe Creation of Adam by Michelangelo Buonarroti\nNine scenes from the Book of Genesis have been transmuted into works of art through the mastery of Michelangelo. These artworks now embellish the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, located in the heart of the Vatican. The most distinct of the images, though, is The Creation of Adam, which was one of the last pieces to be finished. And even though The Last Supper was definitely the source of numerous parodies in its time of existence, this Michelangelo piece probably holds the record.\n\nDocument 9: Skip the Line: Entrance Ticket to Leonardo Da Vincis The Last Supper in Milan\nBeach Enjoy Calm 42cm nbsp;pinkTote Keep Maternity 10 Natural HippoWarehouse Leave litres x38cm Shopping Bag and Gym Duration: 40 minutes\nFill your day with art, and see Leonardo da Vinci’s “The Last Supper” in Milan with a skip-the-line ticket.

Her enigmatic facial expression, her smile, has given this work the appeal that gave it fame. Leonardo models her features softy.\nThe painting is done with oil paint on wood. Mona Lisa wears Florentine clothes which are the fashion of her day. At the backdrop is a mountainous landscape where da Vinci uses his sfumato technique as he gives it heavy shading. The sitter is Lisa Gerardhini, wife of Francesco del Giocondo.\nThe sfumato technique of da Vinci is infused into the curves of Mona Lisa's hair and clothing; this is further applied to the valleys and rivers in the backdrop. There is a dramatic interplay of light and dark in the composition backdrop. The painting is one of the first works of da Vinci, where an imaginary landscape recedes into the distance. This is also one of the early instances where he used aerial perspective to achieve this.\nThe theme of this painting by Leonardo is Christ's Last Supper with His apostles, which is narrated in the four Gospels of the New Testament.\n\nDocument 11: The history of this famous work by Leonardo da Vinci, and why so little of it survives.

This mural, painted between 1495 and 1498, is renowned for its depiction of the moment when Jesus announces that one of his disciples will betray him. The painting's large size and central location within the convent's dining hall emphasize its importance and impact on viewers.

Get your entry!\nDefinition: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media\nFiber amplifiers are optical amplifiers based on optical fibers as gain media. In most cases, the gain medium is a glass fiber doped with rare earth ions such as erbium (EDFA = erbium-doped fiber amplifier), neodymium, ytterbium (YDFA), praseodymium, or thulium. This active dopant is pumped (provided with energy) with light from a laser, such as a fiber-coupled diode laser; in almost all cases, the pump light propagates through the fiber core together with the signal to be amplified. A special type of fiber amplifiers are Raman amplifiers (see below).\nThe originally dominating application of fiber amplifiers was in optical fiber communications over large distances, where signals need to be periodically amplified. Typically, one uses erbium-doped fiber amplifiers with signals of moderate optical power in the 1.5-μm spectral regions. Other important application areas of fiber amplifiers have been developed later. In particular, high-power fiber amplifiers are now used in laser material processing. Typically, these are based on ytterbium-doped double-clad fibers for signals in the spectral region of 1.03–1.1 μm. The output powers can be multiple kilowatts.\nGain and Output Power\nDue to the possible small mode area and long length of an optical fiber, a high gain of tens of decibels can be achieved with a moderate pump power, i.e., the gain efficiency can be very high (particularly for low-power devices). The gain achievable is often limited by ASE (see below). The high surface-to-volume ratio and the robust single-mode guidance also allow for very high output powers with diffraction-limited beam quality, particularly when double-clad fibers are used. However, high-power fiber amplifiers usually have a moderate gain in the final stage, partly due to power efficiency issues; one then uses amplifier chains where the preamplifier provides most of the gain and a final stage the high output power.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:44e6b2cb-5003-45ce-97c7-2b1a0ab458df>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "In terms of gain saturation, fiber amplifiers are very different from semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs). Due to the small transition cross sections, the saturation energy is fairly high, e.g. some tens of microjoules for a typical erbium-doped telecom amplifier, or hundreds of microjoules for a large mode area ytterbium-doped amplifier. As a result, significant energy (sometimes several millijoules) can be stored in a fiber amplifier, and can later be extracted e.g. by a single short pulse. Only for output pulse energies above the saturation energy, pulse distortions through saturation become significant. For amplifying the output of a mode-locked laser, the gain saturation is normally the same as for a continuous-wave laser with the same average power.\nFiber amplifiers are often operated in the strongly saturated regime. This allows for the highest output power, and the effect of slight variations of pump power on the signal output power is substantially reduced.\nASE and Noise\nThe gain achievable is often limited not by the available pump power, but by amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). This can become relevant for gains roughly exceeding 40 dB. High-gain amplifiers also need to be protected from any parasitic reflections, because these could lead to parasitic laser oscillation or even to fiber damage, and are therefore often equipped with optical isolators at the output and possibly also at the input.\nASE also provides the fundamental limitation of the amplifier noise properties. While the excess noise of a loss-less four-level amplifier can approach the theoretical limit, corresponding e.g. to a noise figure of 3 dB in the case of high gain, the excess noise can be stronger for the usual quasi-three-level gain media and in the presence of extra losses. Note that ASE and excess noise are often stronger in backward-pumped amplifiers.\nNoise introduced by the pump source may also be an issue. It can directly affect the gain and thus the signal output power, but not for noise frequencies substantially above the inverse upper-state lifetime. (The laser-active ions represents an energy reservoir which can effectively reduce the effect of fast power fluctuations.) A variable pump power can also lead to temperature-dependent heating which translates into phase noise.\nASE itself may be utilized for superluminescent sources with very low temporal coherence, as required e.g. for optical coherence tomography.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:44e6b2cb-5003-45ce-97c7-2b1a0ab458df>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "WHY AMPLIFIERS ???o To amplify an optical signal with a conventional repeater works well for moderate-speed single wavelength operation.o Repeaters are expensive for high-speed multiple wavelength systems.o Thus optical amplifiers have been developed.o Optical amplifiers boost up the power level of multiple light wave signals.\nERBIUM-DOPED FIBER AMPLIFIERSo Active medium in an optical fiber amplifier consist 10 to 30 m length of optical fiber that has been lightly doped with a rare-earth element such as erbium(Er), thulium(Tm).o Fiber material can be silica or a tellurite glass.o silica doped with erbium is good for long telecommunication.o EDFA operates in the spectral band of 1530 to 1560 nm region that is c band or conventional band.\no Amplification mechanism:- a.

This exploits power transmission rights of way effectively, ensures a power company can own and control the fiber required to monitor its own devices and lines, is effectively immune to tampering, and simplifies the deployment of smart grid technology.\nThe transmission distance of a fiber-optic communication system has traditionally been limited by fiber attenuation and by fiber distortion. By using opto-electronic repeaters, these problems have been eliminated. These repeaters convert the signal into an electrical signal, and then use a transmitter to send the signal again at a higher intensity than was received, thus counteracting the loss incurred in the previous segment. Because of the high complexity with modern wavelength-division multiplexed signals (including the fact that they had to be installed about once every 20 km), the cost of these repeaters is very high.\nAn alternative approach is to use optical amplifiers which amplify the optical signal directly without having to convert the signal to the electrical domain. One common type of optical amplifier is called an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier, or EDFA. These are made by doping a length of fiber with the rare-earth mineral erbium and pumping it with light from a laser with a shorter wavelength than the communications signal (typically 980 nm). EDFAs provide gain in the ITU C band at 1550 nm, which is near the loss minimum for optical fiber.\nOptical amplifiers have several significant advantages over electrical repeaters. First, an optical amplifier can amplify a very wide band at once which can include hundreds of individual channels, eliminating the need to demultiplex DWDM signals at each amplifier. Second, optical amplifiers operate independently of the data rate and modulation format, enabling multiple data rates and modulation formats to co-exist and enabling upgrading of the data rate of a system without having to replace all of the repeaters. Third, optical amplifiers are much simpler than a repeater with the same capabilities and are therefore significantly more reliable. Optical amplifiers have largely replaced repeaters in new installations, although electronic repeaters are still widely used as transponders for wavelength conversion.\nWavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is the practice of multiplying the available capacity of optical fibers through use of parallel channels, each channel on a dedicated wavelength of light.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:54a88a1d-be80-415f-a9ab-bde3d3ced46f>::chunk-7"]}, {"passage": "The efficiency, gain, and signal/noise ratio of three-level devices are quite sensitive to the magnitude and spectrum of the cross sections. These, in turn, depend on the glass composition used as host. We report an investigation which determined the relevant cross sections for a variety of glasses and used them to predict performance trends for fiber amplifiers. Glasses have been identified which have advantages over silica, particularly for pumping with AlGaAs diode lasers at 800 nm.\nThe gain dynamics of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are studied both experimentally and theoretically. It is shown that the transients associated with gain saturation and gain recovery during multichannel amplification have long characteristic times, i.e. in the 100 its-1 ms range. Such slow gain dynamics effectively prevent saturation-induced crosstalk and intermodulation distortion effects in the amplification of high-speed WDM and FDM signals.\nA large signal model of an optically pumped Erbium-doped travelling wave fibre amplifier is presented, including the influence of excited state absorption. The maximum gain and optimal amplifier length are discussed, based on the intensity of pump, signal and amplified spontaneous emission. Special attention is given to the gain degradation depending on the mode distribution of the pump light, and noise figures of the amplifier is presented for co- and counter propagating pump light. Finally, the variation of calculated results towards changes in the values of measured constants is considered.\nWe report on a parametric study to optimize the Er3+-doped fiber amplifiers performances. A 24 dB efficient gain in Er3+- doped silica-based fibers has been achieved for small signal regime at 1.553 μm with a 40 mW pump power in the 1.48-1.49 μm range. The saturation output signal power was up to 20 mW for a gain of 17 dB. For the signal wavelength a 3dB-bandwidth of 30 nm has been obtained always with a pump around 1.48 4m. We achieved these results by optimizing the relevant parameters which are the pump and signal characteristics (wavelength and power), the Er3±-concentration and length for the doped fiber. We report on the main parameters which determine the amplifier efficiency (gain, saturation output power, saturation gain, bandwidth, amplified spontaneous emission,...).", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:011a1c7a-a361-470b-ae7f-dfa0ae1ede16>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "Within optical microchips, light finds its way through channels, waveguides, made of silicon.

The direction of the pump wave does not influence the small-signal gain, but the power efficiency of the saturated amplifier and also the noise characteristics. Bidirectional pumping can be a way not only to apply a high pump power, but also to achieve a low noise figure and a high power efficiency at the same time.\nMost fiber amplifiers (e.g. those based on erbium and ytterbium) operate on quasi-three-level transitions (neodymium-doped amplifiers are a notable exception). This means that in the unpumped state such amplifiers exhibit some losses caused by the active ions; only when a certain excitation level is exceeded, does actual amplification take place. The quasi-three-level nature also has implications for amplifier noise, in particular an increased noise figure, which however can be minimized by certain design optimizations.\nOptical nonlinearities such as the Kerr effect can be significant in fiber amplifiers, particularly for those amplifying ultrashort pulses (→ ultrafast amplifiers). This can lead to strong self-phase modulation, but also to excessive Raman gain and thus to the generation of a strong first-order Stokes wave at a wavelength some tens of nanometers longer than that of the amplified signal. For single-frequency operation, stimulated Brillouin scattering is the most important nonlinearity.\nThe effect of the nonlinearity can be reduced e.g. by increasing the fiber mode area (but at the expense of a lower gain efficiency and possibly worse beam quality) or by decreasing the fiber length. The latter measure becomes possible when using a fiber with higher doping concentration, but this can lead to concentration quenching.\nA technique for radically reducing nonlinear effects is chirped-pulse amplification, where pulses are strongly dispersively stretched before entering the amplifier and subsequently compressed again. All-fiber setups using that technique (with a fiber Bragg grating as the compressor) can generate femtosecond pulses only with energies well below 1 μJ, leading to peak powers in the kilowatt region. Substantially higher peak powers of the order of 100 MW are possible when using bulk-optical elements in addition to a fiber amplifier based on large mode area fiber, but some characteristic advantages of fiber-optic systems are lost with that approach.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:44e6b2cb-5003-45ce-97c7-2b1a0ab458df>::chunk-4"]}, {"passage": "Optical amplifier is an important technology for optical communication networks. Without the need to first convert it to an electrical signal, the optical amplifiers are now used instead of repeaters. As we know, there are several types of optical amplifiers. Among them, the main amplifier technologies are Doped fiber amplifier (eg. EDFA), Semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and Fiber Raman amplifier. Today, we are going to study and compare different types of optical amplifiers in this paper.\nBefore the comparison of the different types of optical amplifiers, let’s take a closer look at fiber optic amplifier. In general, a repeater includes a receiver and transmitter combined in one package. The receiver converts the incoming optical energy into electrical energy. The electrical output of the receiver drives the electrical input of the transmitter. The optical output of the transmitter represents an amplified version of the optical input signal plus noise. Repeaters do not work for fiber-optic networks, where many transmitters send signals to many receivers at different bit rates and in different formats. However, unlike a repeater, an optical amplifier amplify optical signal directly without electric and electric optical transformation. In addition, an ideal optical amplifier could support multi-channel operation over as wide as possible a wavelength band, provide flat gain over a large dynamic gain range, have a high saturated output power, low noise, and effective transient suppression. Several benefits of optical amplifiers as the following:\n- Support any bit rate and signal format\n- Support the entire region of wavelengths\n- Increase the capacity of fiber-optic links by using WDM\n- Provide the capability of all-optical networks, not just point-to-point links\nOK, after a brief introduction of the optical amplifiers, we formally begin today’s main topic. As we talk above, there are three main types of today’s amplifier technology. Each of them has their own working principle, features and applications. We will describe them one by one in the following paragraphs.\nDoped fiber amplifier (The typical representative: EDFA)\nErbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) is the most widely used fiber-optic amplifiers, mainly made of Erbium-doped fiber (EDF), pump light source, optical couplers, optical isolators, optical filters and other components.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:9f798c03-a801-4b24-8e74-a00c0c4932bc>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Mostly, all optical amplifiers are used in optical communication. Generally, Brillouin type amplifier is not used in optical communication. For a particular use, the decision has to be made about which amplifier to be used. The EDFA amplifier is used in-line amplifier on account of its compatibility. On the other hand, Raman Fiber Amplifier (RFA) will be a very good power amplifier because of its high saturation.\nEDFAs and conventional lasers, achieve gain by pumping atoms into a high energy state. This allows the atoms to release their energy when a photon of a suitable wavelength passes nearby. RFAs utilize Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) to create optical gain. Because SRS robs energy from shorter wavelengths and feeds it to longer wavelengths, high channel count DWDM systems initially avoided this technique.\nA RFA amplifier consists of little more than a high-power pump laser, usually called a Raman laser, and a WDM or directional coupler. The optical amplification occurs in the transmission fiber itself, distributed along the transmission path. With amplification up to 10 dB, RFAs provide a wide gain bandwidth (up to 100 nm), allowing them to operate using any installed optical fiber (single mode optical fiber, TrueWave, etc.). By boosting the optical signal in transit, RFAs reduce the effective span loss and improve noise performance.\nCombined with EDFAs, RFAs create a wide gain-flattened optical bandwidth. The figure belwo shows the topology of a typical RFA. The pump laser and optical circulator comprise the two key elements of the RFA amplifier. In this case, the pump laser has a wavelength of 1535 nm. The optical circulator provides a convenient means of injecting light backwards into the transmission path with minimal optical loss.\nHere are the figures which show the optical spectrum of a forward-pumped RFA amplifier and the received signal after the same length of fiber used in the SRS example. The signal gets injected by the 1535 nm pump laser at the transmit end rather than the receive end. Generally, the amplitude of the pump laser exceeds that of the data signals.\nWith a significant decrease in the amplitude of the pump laser, the amplitude of the six data signals has increased, giving all six signals roughly equal amplitudes. In this case, the SRS effect robbed a great deal of energy from the 1535 nm pump laser signal and redistributed that energy to the six data signals.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:08721e12-0492-4fa0-9d9a-3204d40c73bf>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Compared with fully bulk-optical systems, the use of amplifying fibers has the advantage that sufficient single-pass gain is achievable so that the principle of a regenerative amplifier does not need to be used.\nIn some cases, a multi-stage amplifier, i.e., an amplifier chain, needs to be realized. This allows e.g. ASE suppression with filters or modulators between the stages, an optimized power efficiency and noise figure, and possibly a modular approach which increases the flexibility for further amplifier developments.\nMost fiber amplifiers are not made of polarization-maintaining fibers, so they do not preserve the polarization state of the input. On the other hand, the amplification process itself is normally not polarization-dependent; this is an advantage over semiconductor optical amplifiers for use in telecommunications. In some cases, however, polarization hole burning can cause problems.\nFiber Amplifier Modules\nSome companies offer fiber amplifier modules which can be convenient for OEM system integrators. Input and output are then often attached with the usual fiber connectors. A compact module contains not only the actual fiber amplifier(s), but also the control electronics for the pump diodes, and possibly extras such as an input and/or output power monitor, power stabilization, alarms, gain-flattening filters, etc. Such amplifier modules are available based on erbium-doped fibers, ytterbium-doped fibers, and others, and for various power levels.\nRaman Fiber Amplifiers\nRaman amplifiers are based not on a laser amplification process, but on Raman scattering in a fiber.

They have a similar structure to Fabry–Perot laser diodes but with anti-reflection design elements at the end faces. Unlike other optical amplifiers SOAs are pumped electronically (i.e. directly via an applied current), and a separate pump laser is not required.\n1.Stimulated emission to amplify an optical signal.\n2.Active region of the semiconductor.\n3.Injection current to pump electrons at the conduction band.\n4.The input signal stimulates the transition of electrons down to the valence band to acquire an amplification.\nAdvantages & Disadvantages of SOA\n- The semiconductor optical amplifier is of small size and electrically pumped.\n- It can be potentially less expensive than the EDFA and can be integrated with semiconductor lasers, modulators, etc.\n- All four types of nonlinear operations (cross gain modulation, cross phase modulation, wavelength conversion and four wave mixing) can beconducted.\n- SOA can be run with a low power laser.\n\nDocument 2: A significant point is that the erbium gives up its energy in the form of additional photons which are exactly in the same phase and direction as the signal being amplified. Lumped amplifiers, where the pump light can be safely contained to avoid safety implications of high optical powers, may use over 1 W of optical power.\nSecond, Raman amplifiers require a longer gain fiber. Since this creates a loss of power from the cavity which is greater than the gain, it prevents the amplifier from acting as a laser. Systems meeting these specifications, have steadily progressed in the last few years from a few Watts of output power, initially to the 10s of Watts and now into the s of Watts power level.\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. The erbium doped amplifier is a high gain amplifier. Another advantage of operating the DFA optlque the gain saturation region is that small fluctuations in the input signal power are reduced in the output amplified signal: Optics and Photonics Letters. A typical DFA has several tens of meters, long enough to already show this randomness of the birefringence axes.\nCapteur de fibre optique. Titulaire et D’installations de Polissage.\nHowever, Ytterbium doped fiber lasers and amplifiers, operating near 1 micrometre wavelength, have many applications in industrial processing of materials, as these devices can be made with extremely high output power tens of kilowatts. The absorption and emission cross sections optiquue the ions can be modeled ampluficateur ellipsoids with the major axes aligned at random in all directions in different glass sites.\nThe random distribution of the orientation of the ellipsoids in a glass produces a macroscopically isotropic medium, but a strong pump laser induces an anisotropic distribution by selectively exciting those ions that are more aligned with the optical field vector of the pump.\nPanneaux D’adaptateur de Fibre SC. Point est en stock. Adaptateur de Fibre nu. The amplification window is determined by the spectroscopic properties of the dopant ions, the glass structure of the optical fiber, and the wavelength and power of the pump laser.\nAmplicicateur, in optical fibers small amounts of birefringence are always present and, furthermore, the fast and slow axes vary randomly along the fiber length.\n\nDocument 3: In terms of gain saturation, fiber amplifiers are very different from semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs). Due to the small transition cross sections, the saturation energy is fairly high, e.g. some tens of microjoules for a typical erbium-doped telecom amplifier, or hundreds of microjoules for a large mode area ytterbium-doped amplifier. As a result, significant energy (sometimes several millijoules) can be stored in a fiber amplifier, and can later be extracted e.g. by a single short pulse. Only for output pulse energies above the saturation energy, pulse distortions through saturation become significant. For amplifying the output of a mode-locked laser, the gain saturation is normally the same as for a continuous-wave laser with the same average power.\nFiber amplifiers are often operated in the strongly saturated regime. This allows for the highest output power, and the effect of slight variations of pump power on the signal output power is substantially reduced.\nASE and Noise\nThe gain achievable is often limited not by the available pump power, but by amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). This can become relevant for gains roughly exceeding 40 dB. High-gain amplifiers also need to be protected from any parasitic reflections, because these could lead to parasitic laser oscillation or even to fiber damage, and are therefore often equipped with optical isolators at the output and possibly also at the input.\nASE also provides the fundamental limitation of the amplifier noise properties. While the excess noise of a loss-less four-level amplifier can approach the theoretical limit, corresponding e.g. to a noise figure of 3 dB in the case of high gain, the excess noise can be stronger for the usual quasi-three-level gain media and in the presence of extra losses. Note that ASE and excess noise are often stronger in backward-pumped amplifiers.\nNoise introduced by the pump source may also be an issue. It can directly affect the gain and thus the signal output power, but not for noise frequencies substantially above the inverse upper-state lifetime. (The laser-active ions represents an energy reservoir which can effectively reduce the effect of fast power fluctuations.) A variable pump power can also lead to temperature-dependent heating which translates into phase noise.\nASE itself may be utilized for superluminescent sources with very low temporal coherence, as required e.g. for optical coherence tomography.\n\nDocument 4: WHY AMPLIFIERS ???o To amplify an optical signal with a conventional repeater works well for moderate-speed single wavelength operation.o Repeaters are expensive for high-speed multiple wavelength systems.o Thus optical amplifiers have been developed.o Optical amplifiers boost up the power level of multiple light wave signals.\nERBIUM-DOPED FIBER AMPLIFIERSo Active medium in an optical fiber amplifier consist 10 to 30 m length of optical fiber that has been lightly doped with a rare-earth element such as erbium(Er), thulium(Tm).o Fiber material can be silica or a tellurite glass.o silica doped with erbium is good for long telecommunication.o EDFA operates in the spectral band of 1530 to 1560 nm region that is c band or conventional band.\no Amplification mechanism:- a.

The feat has impressed developers\nof fibre optic systems around the world, and could mean significant improvements\nin the performance of optical fibres both for long-distance transmissions\nand for sending signals to many separate terminals or subscribers.\nWhen a signal travels through an optical fibre, some of it is lost,\nor attenuated. The signals must, therefore, be amplified after passing through\nroughly 50 kilometres of fibre. In current systems, the optical signals\nmust be converted to an electronic form before they can be amplified by\na repeater. The stronger electronic signal is then used to drive an optical\nsource connected to the next length of fibre.\nRepeaters are costly and prone to failures. Correcting them can be expensive,\nfor example in cables travelling under the sea. The repeaters must also\nmatch the transmitters and receivers used in the cable, so the cable cannot\nbe upgraded without also replacing the repeaters.\nDesigners would prefer to amplify the signals directly without having\nto convert them first to an electrical form. British Telecom’s researchers\nat the company’s laboratories in Martlesham Heath, near Ipswich, have been\nworking on one approach in which semiconductor lasers amplify the light.\nAt a recent conference in San Francisco on optical fibres, British Telecom\nreported that it had developed semiconductor amplifiers that the researchers\nbelieve produce the highest output from a semiconductor optical amplifier.\nHowever, the performance of semiconductor laser amplifiers has been\neclipsed by another approach using repeaters made of lengths of optical\nfibres doped with small quantities of erbium, a rare earth element. When\nthe erbium atoms are energised by the light they produce light at a wavelength\nof around 1500 nanometres. Conveniently, this is the wavelength at which\nthe signals in the optical fibres are least attenuated. Erbium amplifiers\ngenerate light which is in phase with the light they amplify, in a similar\nfashion to amplifiers based on semiconductor lasers.\nAt the meeting in San Francisco, the researchers from NTT reported that\nthey had set their record using 25 erbium amplifiers, each 160 metres long,\nseparated by 80 kilometres of standard optical fibre.\n\nDocument 6: Another common practice is to bundle many fiber optic strands within long-distance power transmission cable. This exploits power transmission rights of way effectively, ensures a power company can own and control the fiber required to monitor its own devices and lines, is effectively immune to tampering, and simplifies the deployment of smart grid technology.\nThe transmission distance of a fiber-optic communication system has traditionally been limited by fiber attenuation and by fiber distortion. By using opto-electronic repeaters, these problems have been eliminated. These repeaters convert the signal into an electrical signal, and then use a transmitter to send the signal again at a higher intensity than was received, thus counteracting the loss incurred in the previous segment. Because of the high complexity with modern wavelength-division multiplexed signals (including the fact that they had to be installed about once every 20 km), the cost of these repeaters is very high.\nAn alternative approach is to use optical amplifiers which amplify the optical signal directly without having to convert the signal to the electrical domain. One common type of optical amplifier is called an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier, or EDFA. These are made by doping a length of fiber with the rare-earth mineral erbium and pumping it with light from a laser with a shorter wavelength than the communications signal (typically 980 nm). EDFAs provide gain in the ITU C band at 1550 nm, which is near the loss minimum for optical fiber.\nOptical amplifiers have several significant advantages over electrical repeaters. First, an optical amplifier can amplify a very wide band at once which can include hundreds of individual channels, eliminating the need to demultiplex DWDM signals at each amplifier. Second, optical amplifiers operate independently of the data rate and modulation format, enabling multiple data rates and modulation formats to co-exist and enabling upgrading of the data rate of a system without having to replace all of the repeaters. Third, optical amplifiers are much simpler than a repeater with the same capabilities and are therefore significantly more reliable. Optical amplifiers have largely replaced repeaters in new installations, although electronic repeaters are still widely used as transponders for wavelength conversion.\nWavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is the practice of multiplying the available capacity of optical fibers through use of parallel channels, each channel on a dedicated wavelength of light.\n\nDocument 7: The efficiency, gain, and signal/noise ratio of three-level devices are quite sensitive to the magnitude and spectrum of the cross sections. These, in turn, depend on the glass composition used as host. We report an investigation which determined the relevant cross sections for a variety of glasses and used them to predict performance trends for fiber amplifiers. Glasses have been identified which have advantages over silica, particularly for pumping with AlGaAs diode lasers at 800 nm.\nThe gain dynamics of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are studied both experimentally and theoretically. It is shown that the transients associated with gain saturation and gain recovery during multichannel amplification have long characteristic times, i.e. in the 100 its-1 ms range. Such slow gain dynamics effectively prevent saturation-induced crosstalk and intermodulation distortion effects in the amplification of high-speed WDM and FDM signals.\nA large signal model of an optically pumped Erbium-doped travelling wave fibre amplifier is presented, including the influence of excited state absorption. The maximum gain and optimal amplifier length are discussed, based on the intensity of pump, signal and amplified spontaneous emission. Special attention is given to the gain degradation depending on the mode distribution of the pump light, and noise figures of the amplifier is presented for co- and counter propagating pump light. Finally, the variation of calculated results towards changes in the values of measured constants is considered.\nWe report on a parametric study to optimize the Er3+-doped fiber amplifiers performances. A 24 dB efficient gain in Er3+- doped silica-based fibers has been achieved for small signal regime at 1.553 μm with a 40 mW pump power in the 1.48-1.49 μm range. The saturation output signal power was up to 20 mW for a gain of 17 dB. For the signal wavelength a 3dB-bandwidth of 30 nm has been obtained always with a pump around 1.48 4m. We achieved these results by optimizing the relevant parameters which are the pump and signal characteristics (wavelength and power), the Er3±-concentration and length for the doped fiber. We report on the main parameters which determine the amplifier efficiency (gain, saturation output power, saturation gain, bandwidth, amplified spontaneous emission,...).\n\nDocument 8: Within optical microchips, light finds its way through channels, waveguides, made of silicon. Light from a glass fiber, for example, is led through a structure of optical channels with splitters and couplers. Silicon is the workhorse for this, but it is still passive conduction of light, with some losses as well. To be able to amplify the signal, or even to include a light source on the chip, extra steps are necessary. Other types of semiconductors, like Gallium Arsenide, are an option. But materials doped with the rare earth material erbium have good amplification properties as well.\n\nDocument 9: with a pump wave copropagating with the signal wave), in the backward direction, or bidirectionally. The direction of the pump wave does not influence the small-signal gain, but the power efficiency of the saturated amplifier and also the noise characteristics. Bidirectional pumping can be a way not only to apply a high pump power, but also to achieve a low noise figure and a high power efficiency at the same time.\nMost fiber amplifiers (e.g. those based on erbium and ytterbium) operate on quasi-three-level transitions (neodymium-doped amplifiers are a notable exception). This means that in the unpumped state such amplifiers exhibit some losses caused by the active ions; only when a certain excitation level is exceeded, does actual amplification take place. The quasi-three-level nature also has implications for amplifier noise, in particular an increased noise figure, which however can be minimized by certain design optimizations.\nOptical nonlinearities such as the Kerr effect can be significant in fiber amplifiers, particularly for those amplifying ultrashort pulses (→ ultrafast amplifiers). This can lead to strong self-phase modulation, but also to excessive Raman gain and thus to the generation of a strong first-order Stokes wave at a wavelength some tens of nanometers longer than that of the amplified signal. For single-frequency operation, stimulated Brillouin scattering is the most important nonlinearity.\nThe effect of the nonlinearity can be reduced e.g. by increasing the fiber mode area (but at the expense of a lower gain efficiency and possibly worse beam quality) or by decreasing the fiber length. The latter measure becomes possible when using a fiber with higher doping concentration, but this can lead to concentration quenching.\nA technique for radically reducing nonlinear effects is chirped-pulse amplification, where pulses are strongly dispersively stretched before entering the amplifier and subsequently compressed again. All-fiber setups using that technique (with a fiber Bragg grating as the compressor) can generate femtosecond pulses only with energies well below 1 μJ, leading to peak powers in the kilowatt region. Substantially higher peak powers of the order of 100 MW are possible when using bulk-optical elements in addition to a fiber amplifier based on large mode area fiber, but some characteristic advantages of fiber-optic systems are lost with that approach.\n\nDocument 10: |<<< | >>> | Feedback|\nThe ideal place to find suppliers for photonics products: high-quality information, simple and fast, respects your privacy!\n54 suppliers for fiber amplifiers are listed.\nYour are not yet listed? Get your entry!\nDefinition: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media\nFiber amplifiers are optical amplifiers based on optical fibers as gain media. In most cases, the gain medium is a glass fiber doped with rare earth ions such as erbium (EDFA = erbium-doped fiber amplifier), neodymium, ytterbium (YDFA), praseodymium, or thulium. This active dopant is pumped (provided with energy) with light from a laser, such as a fiber-coupled diode laser; in almost all cases, the pump light propagates through the fiber core together with the signal to be amplified. A special type of fiber amplifiers are Raman amplifiers (see below).\nThe originally dominating application of fiber amplifiers was in optical fiber communications over large distances, where signals need to be periodically amplified. Typically, one uses erbium-doped fiber amplifiers with signals of moderate optical power in the 1.5-μm spectral regions. Other important application areas of fiber amplifiers have been developed later. In particular, high-power fiber amplifiers are now used in laser material processing. Typically, these are based on ytterbium-doped double-clad fibers for signals in the spectral region of 1.03–1.1 μm. The output powers can be multiple kilowatts.\nGain and Output Power\nDue to the possible small mode area and long length of an optical fiber, a high gain of tens of decibels can be achieved with a moderate pump power, i.e., the gain efficiency can be very high (particularly for low-power devices). The gain achievable is often limited by ASE (see below). The high surface-to-volume ratio and the robust single-mode guidance also allow for very high output powers with diffraction-limited beam quality, particularly when double-clad fibers are used. However, high-power fiber amplifiers usually have a moderate gain in the final stage, partly due to power efficiency issues; one then uses amplifier chains where the preamplifier provides most of the gain and a final stage the high output power.\n\nDocument 11: Optical amplifier is an important technology for optical communication networks. Without the need to first convert it to an electrical signal, the optical amplifiers are now used instead of repeaters. As we know, there are several types of optical amplifiers. Among them, the main amplifier technologies are Doped fiber amplifier (eg. EDFA), Semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and Fiber Raman amplifier. Today, we are going to study and compare different types of optical amplifiers in this paper.\nBefore the comparison of the different types of optical amplifiers, let’s take a closer look at fiber optic amplifier. In general, a repeater includes a receiver and transmitter combined in one package. The receiver converts the incoming optical energy into electrical energy. The electrical output of the receiver drives the electrical input of the transmitter. The optical output of the transmitter represents an amplified version of the optical input signal plus noise. Repeaters do not work for fiber-optic networks, where many transmitters send signals to many receivers at different bit rates and in different formats. However, unlike a repeater, an optical amplifier amplify optical signal directly without electric and electric optical transformation. In addition, an ideal optical amplifier could support multi-channel operation over as wide as possible a wavelength band, provide flat gain over a large dynamic gain range, have a high saturated output power, low noise, and effective transient suppression. Several benefits of optical amplifiers as the following:\n- Support any bit rate and signal format\n- Support the entire region of wavelengths\n- Increase the capacity of fiber-optic links by using WDM\n- Provide the capability of all-optical networks, not just point-to-point links\nOK, after a brief introduction of the optical amplifiers, we formally begin today’s main topic. As we talk above, there are three main types of today’s amplifier technology. Each of them has their own working principle, features and applications. We will describe them one by one in the following paragraphs.\nDoped fiber amplifier (The typical representative: EDFA)\nErbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA) is the most widely used fiber-optic amplifiers, mainly made of Erbium-doped fiber (EDF), pump light source, optical couplers, optical isolators, optical filters and other components.\n\nDocument 12: Mostly, all optical amplifiers are used in optical communication. Generally, Brillouin type amplifier is not used in optical communication. For a particular use, the decision has to be made about which amplifier to be used. The EDFA amplifier is used in-line amplifier on account of its compatibility. On the other hand, Raman Fiber Amplifier (RFA) will be a very good power amplifier because of its high saturation.\nEDFAs and conventional lasers, achieve gain by pumping atoms into a high energy state. This allows the atoms to release their energy when a photon of a suitable wavelength passes nearby. RFAs utilize Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) to create optical gain. Because SRS robs energy from shorter wavelengths and feeds it to longer wavelengths, high channel count DWDM systems initially avoided this technique.\nA RFA amplifier consists of little more than a high-power pump laser, usually called a Raman laser, and a WDM or directional coupler. The optical amplification occurs in the transmission fiber itself, distributed along the transmission path. With amplification up to 10 dB, RFAs provide a wide gain bandwidth (up to 100 nm), allowing them to operate using any installed optical fiber (single mode optical fiber, TrueWave, etc.). By boosting the optical signal in transit, RFAs reduce the effective span loss and improve noise performance.\nCombined with EDFAs, RFAs create a wide gain-flattened optical bandwidth. The figure belwo shows the topology of a typical RFA. The pump laser and optical circulator comprise the two key elements of the RFA amplifier. In this case, the pump laser has a wavelength of 1535 nm. The optical circulator provides a convenient means of injecting light backwards into the transmission path with minimal optical loss.\nHere are the figures which show the optical spectrum of a forward-pumped RFA amplifier and the received signal after the same length of fiber used in the SRS example. The signal gets injected by the 1535 nm pump laser at the transmit end rather than the receive end. Generally, the amplitude of the pump laser exceeds that of the data signals.\nWith a significant decrease in the amplitude of the pump laser, the amplitude of the six data signals has increased, giving all six signals roughly equal amplitudes. In this case, the SRS effect robbed a great deal of energy from the 1535 nm pump laser signal and redistributed that energy to the six data signals.\n\nDocument 13: Compared with fully bulk-optical systems, the use of amplifying fibers has the advantage that sufficient single-pass gain is achievable so that the principle of a regenerative amplifier does not need to be used.\nIn some cases, a multi-stage amplifier, i.e., an amplifier chain, needs to be realized. This allows e.g. ASE suppression with filters or modulators between the stages, an optimized power efficiency and noise figure, and possibly a modular approach which increases the flexibility for further amplifier developments.\nMost fiber amplifiers are not made of polarization-maintaining fibers, so they do not preserve the polarization state of the input. On the other hand, the amplification process itself is normally not polarization-dependent; this is an advantage over semiconductor optical amplifiers for use in telecommunications. In some cases, however, polarization hole burning can cause problems.\nFiber Amplifier Modules\nSome companies offer fiber amplifier modules which can be convenient for OEM system integrators. Input and output are then often attached with the usual fiber connectors. A compact module contains not only the actual fiber amplifier(s), but also the control electronics for the pump diodes, and possibly extras such as an input and/or output power monitor, power stabilization, alarms, gain-flattening filters, etc. Such amplifier modules are available based on erbium-doped fibers, ytterbium-doped fibers, and others, and for various power levels.\nRaman Fiber Amplifiers\nRaman amplifiers are based not on a laser amplification process, but on Raman scattering in a fiber. They differ in various respects from rare-earth-doped amplifiers, and are discussed in the article on Raman amplifiers.\n|||C. J. Koester and E. Snitzer, “Amplification in a fiber laser”, Appl.

The use of fiber amplifiers, and specifically erbium-doped fiber amplifiers, is well-known in the art and will be used in the examples described below. It should be noted that although erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are particularly well-suited to provide amplification in the present invention, and will be described herein, other suitable rare-earth elements may also be used, such as praseodymium, neodymium, and the like.\nAccording to the principles of the invention, optical fiber amplification may be incorporated using a number of different configurations. For example, fiber optical amplifiers 390 may be placed before input optical couplers 310 in optical router portion 340 or after output optical couplers 320 in optical combiner portion 341. Alternatively, fiber optical amplifiers (not shown) may be distributed within the wavelength-selective optical fibers 325 in a similar manner as that described in our co-pending U.S. application Ser. No. 08/777,890, filed Dec. 31, 1996, which is herein incorporated by reference. In yet another configuration, fiber optical amplifiers (not shown) may be judiciously integrated with the tunable fiber gratings 330 along wavelength-selective optical fibers 325 as described in our co-pending U.S. applications, Ser. Nos. 08/920,390 and 08/920,391, both filed on Aug. 29, 1997, both of which are herein incorporated by reference.\nAlthough not explicitly shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, it is contemplated that selected ones of fiber gratings 210 and 330, respectively, can be controlled to facilitate the appropriate “through” routing and “cross-connect” routing of individual channels within the multi-wavelength optical signals. Accordingly, the various control techniques previously described for FIG. 1 apply equally to the embodiments shown in FIGS. 8 and 9.\nFIG. 10(a) shows one of the input optical couplers 310 from optical router portion 340 of optical cross-connect arrangement 300 (FIG. 9). The configuration in FIG. 10(a) essentially represents a 1×M wavelength-selective optical distributor which is a basic building block for the K×M wavelength-selective cross-connect arrangement.\n\nDocument 15: For cases with erbium-ytterbium energy transfers, double-clad fibers, pulsed amplification, etc., this is even more the case.\nNeodymium and Ytterbium Fiber Amplifiers\nFiber amplifiers based on ytterbium- or neodymium-doped double-clad fibers can be used to boost the output power of 1-μm laser sources to very high levels of up to several kilowatts (→ high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers). The broad gain bandwidth is also suitable for the amplification of ultrashort pulses (→ ultrafast amplifiers); limitations arise from fiber nonlinearities such as the Kerr effect and Raman effect (see below). Single-frequency signals can also be amplified to high powers; in this case, stimulated Brillouin scattering usually sets the limits.\nNeodymium-based amplifiers can also be used in the 1.3-μm spectral region, but with less favorable performance figures .\nErbium Fiber Amplifiers\nFiber amplifiers based on erbium-doped single-mode fibers (EDFAs) are widely used in long-range optical fiber communication systems for compensating the loss of long fiber spans. See the article on erbium-doped fiber amplifiers for more details.\nThulium Fiber Amplifiers\nThulium-doped fluoride fibers (TDFA = thulium-doped amplifier) pumped around 1047 or 1400 nm can be used for amplification in the telecom S band around 1460–1530 nm, or even around 1.65 μm. Combined thulium–erbium amplifiers can thus provide optical amplification in a very wide wavelength range.\nThere are also thulium-doped amplifiers for the first telecom window, operating at ≈ 800–850 nm.\nPraseodymium Fiber Amplifiers\nFiber amplifiers for the second telecom window around 1.3 μm are also available [7, 9], but have a lower performance compared with that of erbium-doped amplifiers. They can be based on praseodymium-doped fluoride fibers (PDFA = praseodymium-doped amplifier), which are pumped around 1020 nm (a relatively inconvenient pump wavelength) or at 1047 nm (with a YLF laser).\nSome Design Issues\nFiber amplifiers can be pumped in forward direction (i.e.\n\nQuestion: What makes Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers special in terms of how they amplify signals?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Erbium Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs) are specialized due to their ability to amplify signals across a broad wavelength range in the 1550nm region, which is crucial for modern optical communication systems. They achieve this by using trivalent erbium ions (Er3+) inserted into the silica core of an optical fiber. The working principle involves pumping the erbium ions with light at wavelengths around 980 nm or 1450 nm, exciting them to a higher energy state. When a signal photon at a wavelength in the 1.5-μm region passes by, it triggers stimulated emission, causing the excited erbium ions to release energy in the form of additional photons that are in phase and direction with the signal, thus amplifying it. This process allows EDFAs to amplify a wide wavelength band (>80nm) in the 1550nm region with relatively flat gain, making them highly efficient for long-haul optical communication systems."}
{"id": 34, "question": "When and where was Stravinsky's ballet suite, which rearranged Pergolesi's work, first performed?", "passages": [{"passage": "Colorful and traditional are a rare yet beautiful combination, which led me to choose Igor Stravinsky’s Pulcinella Suite as the musical pairing. This piece is neoclassicism at its finest. The work was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, who was the founder of the Ballet Russes and one of the primary influences behind Stravinsky’s ballet repertoire. Diaghilev wanted a ballet inspired by commedia dell’arte, and Stravinsky was naturally tasked with creating the musical score…while the costumes and set were designed by none other than Pablo Picasso! The ballet is based around Pulcinella (pictured right), who was a classic character of the commedia dell’arte genre. Stravinsky revised the original music (believed to have been written by 18th-century composer Giovanni Pergolesi) by incorporating contemporary harmonies and rhythms and by scoring it for a sizable chamber orchestra.

Yet the work subsequently came to be identified more directly with Stravinsky as composer rather than arranger, in part a consequence of the concert suites he made of the score, including the version from 1922 (revised 1949). While Stravinsky later asserted that the ‘remarkable thing about Pulcinella is not how much but how little has been added or changed’, the alterations are significant enough to turn the music instantly into something unmistakably of the 20th century. Stravinsky began by working directly onto the transcriptions Diaghilev had given him, subtly annotating the melodies and bass lines of arias by Pergolesi, trio sonata movements by Gallo, and even a tarantella by Wassenaer. Sometimes the result was just a representation of the original in Stravinsky’s own accent. No-one could mistake the trombone and double-bass melody of the ‘Vivo’ for anything other than Stravinsky, even though every note of Pergolesi’s music is still present. There are cunning harmonic touches, anachronistic pedal points and off-beat accents that reveal the thumbprint of the arranger, but it remains a loving, albeit humorous, homage to Pergolesi. The same is true of the opening ‘Sinfonia’ (original music by Gallo). Elsewhere, however, Stravinsky declares his hand more decisively. In the ‘Serenata’, for instance, he adds an unchanging drone (an open fifth), which denies the music its forward movement and whose resulting dissonances bestow a languid, melancholic air.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:97989afa-40c7-435e-b72e-ed20a60a3317>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Lucinda Childs and Robert Wilson have revived their 1981 work Relative Calm in a new extended production that world-premiered last week in Rome, Italy, at the Auditorium Parco Della Musica Ennio Morricone.\nThe show includes a reinterpretation of the two choreographies by Lucinda Childs to the music of John Adams and John Gibson and is extended into a triptych with a new creation on the music of Pulcinella by Igor Stravinsky.\n“The whole show, in its three symmetrical parts will be like a clock that measures time, like the succession of the hours of the day.” — Robert Wilson\nIn the mid-seventies, Robert Wilson asked Lucinda Childs to be part of his opera Einstein on the Beach, on which he was working with Philip Glass.\nA few years later, in 1981, Childs asked Wilson to do the lights and design the space for a dance show she was creating with Jon Gibson at The Kitchen in New York. When they started thinking about a new work together, precisely forty years later and right in the middle of the pandemic isolation days, that 1981 show came back to their mind: Relative Calm.\nThey decided to extend that work and came up with the idea of choreographing Stravinsky’s Pulcinella. “I really liked the idea of Stravinsky as a central counterpoint to two musical compositions by contemporary authors such as Jon Gibson and John Adams,” Wilson says. “So we structured the work in three parts to compose a complete show of dance, music, lights, and images.”\nWilson particularly enjoyed working on Stravinsky. “Stravinsky’s is a completely different world from mine, with a different colour spectrum. Different and, therefore, structurally interesting to me. I faced Pulcinella‘s suite the same way I always relate to written compositions: I respect the composer, but then I don’t want to become his slave, so I stage it in my own way.”\nFor Wilson, all his theatre, in a sense, is a masque with music and text; the image on stage is what one sees, while what is heard is something different. “From this point of view, my theater is very classic,” Wilson says, “just like in Greek theater where actors were “masks”, or as in Noh theater, in the Bunraku in Japan, the Kathakali in India.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:2db4decd-81be-478a-ac07-57240966cd31>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Stravinsky - COE - BBC Music Magazine\n25 November 2009BBC Music Magazine\nIt takes an exceptional release these days to get away with a length of as little as 54 minutes.

Interestingly, this overture does not include any lower strings at all – with only violas and violins performing from the string section, with little bass at all in the orchestra.\nThe Dances follow, with six short dances, from act two, grouped into one larger movement. The famous March opens the movement, before introducing the iconic Dance of the sugar-plum fairy, which used the newly-invented Celeste, almost a cross between a glockenspiel and a piano. Tchaikovsky saw a Celeste for the first time the year before, and wrote to his publisher asking for one – but to keep it a secret… he wanted to be the first to use it. Next, the Russian Dance is followed by the gentle Arabian Dance and the rhythmic Chinese Dance, famous for its difficult, impressive choreography.

In that year, two of the 26-year-old composer's works were conducted by Alexander Siloti in St. Petersburg: Scherzo fantastique and Fireworks. Hardly earth-shakers by the lights of what was to come, but sufficiently original and imaginative to make an impression on at least one connoisseur in the audience, Sergei Diaghilev, who was about to launch a new company to perform a mixed season of ballet and opera in Paris. The French capital was at the time particularly taken with the kind of exotic orientalia Russian artists were likely to offer.\nWith dancer-choreographer Mikhail Fokine and scenic artists Leon Bakst and Alexandre Benois on board, Diaghilev lacked only a resident composer to round out his creative staff. That Stravinsky was his man was proven by his successful handling of some test assignments for the opening season of what would be called the Ballets Russes, including the orchestration of Chopin's piano Nocturne in A-flat and Valse brillante in E-flat, for the opening and closing numbers of Fokine's Les Sylphides.\nDuring the company's second season, in 1909, Diaghilev gave his potential resident composer something more demanding. When Anatol Liadov was unable to make much progress on a score commissioned from him for a ballet on the Russian legend of the magical Firebird and the Tsarevich Ivan, Diaghilev transferred the project to Stravinsky, who was at the time living in the country home, near St. Petersburg, of the Rimsky-Korsakov family at the invitation of the late composer's son, Andrei.\nThe lavish production of L'oiseau de feu, as it was called, was first seen in the Paris Opera on June 25, 1910. Choreography was by Fokine, who also danced the role of the Tsarevich.

The score by Igor Stravinsky was a panoply of shifting syncopations and dissonant harmonies, while the choreography by famed danseur Vaslav Nijinsky curled the dancers' bodies inward as they jerkily stamped and jumped across the stage. Archaeologist and painter Nicholas Roerich contributed the set design and the costumes, which were described in a 2002 Ballet Magazine article as \"heavy smocks, handpainted with [primitive] symbols of circles and squares.\" The pre-Modernist audience, accustomed to the demure grace of classical ballet, was further outraged by the graphic nature of the ballet's story--the pagan sacrifice of a virgin by her village to usher in spring. Nijinsky's ballet was performed only seven more times--in Paris and London-- before disappearing from the classical repertoire for reasons including Nijinsky's mental breakdown and the deterioration of his relationship with Diaghilev. Many new iterations of the ballet were choreographed--including versions by Pina Bausch and Martha Graham--but only the score remained intact from the initial performances.

The tragic ending was replaced by a happier conclusion, and the action compressed from four acts into three.

An idealist, she maintained that public exposure to good new music was essential to a powerful society, and her aim was to build an auditorium for the Library of Congress to support these goals.\nMrs. Coolidge donated $60,000 to the Library to build the theater and develop the project. She established an annual chamber music festival and commissioned her favorite international composers to create original works. For the third season in 1928, Coolidge determined that she wanted to plan a program with dance as a central focus, and she requested that Carl Engel, chief of the Music Division, contact Adolph Bolm to be choreographer.\nTwo composers, de Falla and Ottorino Respighi, declined the commission, and in 1927 Coolidge contacted Stravinsky to compose a chamber ballet that would be performed at the festival. She set many parameters, requiring that the chamber ballet be 30 minutes in length and employ no more than six dancers and a modest orchestration so that the work would be accommodated on the Coolidge Auditorium's small stage. For this commission, Stravinsky created \"Apollon Musagète\" with choreography by Bolm. Nicholas Remisoff designed the costumes and scenery, and the dancers included Bolm as Apollo, and Ruth Page, Elise Reiman and Berenice Holmes as the Muses. This ballet was announced as \"the first time in history a major ballet work had its world premiere in America.\"\nNonetheless, Bolm's \"Apollo\" was beset with difficulties, ranging from Stravinsky's cavalier and egocentric treatment of the project to the limitations of the stage size and the small audience capacity.

This piece is neoclassicism at its finest. The work was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, who was the founder of the Ballet Russes and one of the primary influences behind Stravinsky’s ballet repertoire. Diaghilev wanted a ballet inspired by commedia dell’arte, and Stravinsky was naturally tasked with creating the musical score…while the costumes and set were designed by none other than Pablo Picasso! The ballet is based around Pulcinella (pictured right), who was a classic character of the commedia dell’arte genre. Stravinsky revised the original music (believed to have been written by 18th-century composer Giovanni Pergolesi) by incorporating contemporary harmonies and rhythms and by scoring it for a sizable chamber orchestra. He says the following of the piece:\n“Pulcinella was my discovery of the past, the epiphany through which the whole of my late work became possible. It was a backward look, of course—the first of many love affairs in that direction—but it was a look in the mirror, too.”\nThe ballet was premiered for a Parisian audience in May 1920. 2 years later, Stravinsky abridged the ballet into a “Suite” for chamber orchestra, which uses 11 of the original 18 movements – the work has since become a standard of the orchestral canon. Like the above dish, Pulcinella is by far one of my favorites – the colors and characters are truly unparalleled, and I hope you enjoy it!\n\nDocument 2: - Russian composer who brote this ballet piece after the 1st World War\n- Other compositions The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913) used massive symphony orchestras\n- After war performances had to be less flamboyant\n- Director of Ballet Russes Serge Diaghilec asked Stravinsky to take 18thC composer Pergolesi's work and rearrange it\n- Vivo (cello sonata) is by Pergolesi, Sinfonia (Trio Sonata) is actually by Gallo and Gavotta (keyboard piece) is by Monza.\n- The suite completed in 1922.\n- First performed in 1922 in Boston, USA by Pierre Monteux who championed Stranvinsky's music.\n1 of 14\nRepresented reaction against overblown emotions and formlessness of late 19thC music.\n- Movements in neo-classicism were short - suited ballet\n- Structures based of 18thC ritornello, sonata form, variation, rondo, and simple binary and ternary forms\n- Harmonies based on originals with added dischords\n- Rhythms used influence of jazz (syncapation)\n- Used wider variety of instrumentation and techniques than what would have been used in 18thC\nThis suite is relatively close to 18thC pieces with melodies, structure and basic harmonies kept the same.\n2 of 14\nPerformance Forces and their Handling\n- Original pieces only had a max of 4 players\n- Wrote for chamber orchestra of 32 players - what haydn might have used in late 18thC\n- Use of solo trombone in vivo not in 18thC piece\n- Separate string group in concerto grosso style has 5 solo string players and no continuo - usually 2 violins and cello with harpsichord/organ continuo.\n- Double bass part was same as cello in 18thC but in vivo there is virtuoso solo part.\n- Adds many articulations like slurs and staccatos less frequently found in 18thC music.\n\nDocument 3: Welcome to Hyperion Records, an independent British classical label devoted to presenting high-quality recordings of music of all styles and from all periods from the twelfth century to the twenty-first.\nHyperion offers both CDs, and downloads in a number of formats.

Yet the work subsequently came to be identified more directly with Stravinsky as composer rather than arranger, in part a consequence of the concert suites he made of the score, including the version from 1922 (revised 1949). While Stravinsky later asserted that the ‘remarkable thing about Pulcinella is not how much but how little has been added or changed’, the alterations are significant enough to turn the music instantly into something unmistakably of the 20th century. Stravinsky began by working directly onto the transcriptions Diaghilev had given him, subtly annotating the melodies and bass lines of arias by Pergolesi, trio sonata movements by Gallo, and even a tarantella by Wassenaer. Sometimes the result was just a representation of the original in Stravinsky’s own accent. No-one could mistake the trombone and double-bass melody of the ‘Vivo’ for anything other than Stravinsky, even though every note of Pergolesi’s music is still present. There are cunning harmonic touches, anachronistic pedal points and off-beat accents that reveal the thumbprint of the arranger, but it remains a loving, albeit humorous, homage to Pergolesi. The same is true of the opening ‘Sinfonia’ (original music by Gallo). Elsewhere, however, Stravinsky declares his hand more decisively. In the ‘Serenata’, for instance, he adds an unchanging drone (an open fifth), which denies the music its forward movement and whose resulting dissonances bestow a languid, melancholic air.\n\nDocument 4: Stravinsky and Glazunov conduct their own Ballet music\n\"Stravinsky’s performance is filled with passion and considerable dramatic understanding ... The performance we have here of [Glazunov's] own music is masterful\" - Fanfare\nThis release presents music from three Russian ballets premièred\nwithin the first two decades of the 20th Century, which reflect the\nenormous stylistic changes going on in music during the period. Igor\nStravinsky began as an admirer of Glazunov, but soon set out on his own\ncourse with The Firebird in 1910. The following year saw the première of Petrushka, a work which the conservative elder composer characterized as “not music, but […] excellently and skillfully orchestrated.”\nStravinsky made some never-published acoustic piano sides for the Brunswick label while on tour in America in 1925, but the present suite from Petrushka was his first issued recording. Although the ballet had, by that time, been recorded twice complete on eight sides by HMV (acoustically by Goossens, electrically by Coates, the latter on Pristine PASC 304), Columbia opted to record only a suite on six sides. Missing from this version were the “Dance of the Ballerina” and most of the “Waltz: The Ballerina and the Moor” in Scene III, and “The Peasant and the Bear” (except for the opening bars) and “The Jovial Merchant with Two Gypsy Girls” in Scene IV. Like other concert versions of the ballet, it ends with “The Masqueraders”, rather than with Petrushka’s fight, death, and ghostly reappearance.\nAfter this recording made in London, the focus of Stravinsky’s microphonic activities shifted for the next few years to Paris. At the tail end of his 1928 Firebird Suite sessions (Pristine PASC 387), he recorded the last three selections from the suite to Pulcinella, his ballet for orchestra and singers based on works by Pergolesi, which had marked the beginning of Stravinsky’s neoclassical period. Four years later, he returned to the work and recorded two more movements, but did not record any further excerpts during the 78 rpm era.\n\nDocument 5: Lucinda Childs and Robert Wilson have revived their 1981 work Relative Calm in a new extended production that world-premiered last week in Rome, Italy, at the Auditorium Parco Della Musica Ennio Morricone.\nThe show includes a reinterpretation of the two choreographies by Lucinda Childs to the music of John Adams and John Gibson and is extended into a triptych with a new creation on the music of Pulcinella by Igor Stravinsky.\n“The whole show, in its three symmetrical parts will be like a clock that measures time, like the succession of the hours of the day.” — Robert Wilson\nIn the mid-seventies, Robert Wilson asked Lucinda Childs to be part of his opera Einstein on the Beach, on which he was working with Philip Glass.\nA few years later, in 1981, Childs asked Wilson to do the lights and design the space for a dance show she was creating with Jon Gibson at The Kitchen in New York. When they started thinking about a new work together, precisely forty years later and right in the middle of the pandemic isolation days, that 1981 show came back to their mind: Relative Calm.\nThey decided to extend that work and came up with the idea of choreographing Stravinsky’s Pulcinella. “I really liked the idea of Stravinsky as a central counterpoint to two musical compositions by contemporary authors such as Jon Gibson and John Adams,” Wilson says. “So we structured the work in three parts to compose a complete show of dance, music, lights, and images.”\nWilson particularly enjoyed working on Stravinsky. “Stravinsky’s is a completely different world from mine, with a different colour spectrum. Different and, therefore, structurally interesting to me. I faced Pulcinella‘s suite the same way I always relate to written compositions: I respect the composer, but then I don’t want to become his slave, so I stage it in my own way.”\nFor Wilson, all his theatre, in a sense, is a masque with music and text; the image on stage is what one sees, while what is heard is something different. “From this point of view, my theater is very classic,” Wilson says, “just like in Greek theater where actors were “masks”, or as in Noh theater, in the Bunraku in Japan, the Kathakali in India.\n\nDocument 6: Stravinsky - COE - BBC Music Magazine\n25 November 2009BBC Music Magazine\nIt takes an exceptional release these days to get away with a length of as little as 54 minutes. But then the Chamber Orchestra of Europe is a rather special ensemble, retaining 18 of the pioneering young artists who originally set it up in 1981 complemented by the front desk players from all over the European Union. The result is a wonderfully characterful wind section plus a string body of vibrant unanimity and warmth. These qualities are enhanced by the church acoustic in which these sessions took place, yet skilful microphone placement has ensured that not a detail is lost.\nThe COE's leader Alexander Janiczek directs these readings from the first violin. In Stravinsky's ballet blanc for string orchestra, Apollon musagete (1928), he steers a middle way between the suave smoothness of the Karajan approach and the edgy haste Stravinsky's own later readings tended to take on. Tempos are moderate, but there is no lack of spring to the rhythms while the opening of the ‘Pas de Deux' is mesmerising in its translucent poise.\nThe Suite from the Baroque make-over Pulcinella (1920) is an altogether livelier, gutsier affair as delivered here, with a terrific rhythmic snap to the finale. What a pity not to record the entire ballet with this outstanding élan. The disc could have contained it.\nRelated LinksChamber Orchestra of EuropeStravinsky Apollon musagète & Pulcinella Suite\n\nDocument 7: Prokofiev's inexperience in ballet led him to revise the work extensively in the 1920s, following Diaghilev's detailed critique, prior to its first production. The ballet's premiere in Paris on 17 May 1921 was a huge success and was greeted with great admiration by an audience that included Jean Cocteau, Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel.

He studied organ in order to avoid conscription. He composed The Gambler based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel of the same name, but rehearsals were plagued by problems and the scheduled 1917 première had to be canceled because of the February Revolution. In the summer of that year, Prokofiev composed his first symphony, the Classical. This was his own name for the symphony, which was written in the style that, according to Prokofiev, Joseph Haydn would have used if he had been alive at the time. It is more or less classical in style but incorporates more modern musical elements (see Neoclassicism). This symphony was also an exact contemporary of Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1 in D major, Op. 19, which was scheduled to premiere in November 1917. The first performances of both works had to wait until 21 April 1918 and 18 October 1923, respectively. He stayed briefly with his mother in Kislovodsk in the Caucasus. Worried about the enemy capturing Saint Petersburg, he returned in 1918. By then he was determined to leave Russia, at least temporarily. He saw no room for his experimental music and, in May, he headed for the USA.

By this point, he had not even named the work, and in surviving sketches it is referred to as the ‘Fir Tree’ and ‘Christmas Tree’ ballet suites.\nDespite the rush to find something suitable for the concert he was preparing, what became known as the ‘Nutcracker Suite‘ was an instant success. In the same year, it was also performed in Moscow and Chicago, and in the following year, Tchaikovsky conducted performances in Brussels and Odessa, in the Ukraine.\nThe suite has three broad movements, beginning with the Miniature Overture. This cute sonatina opening also opens the ballet, which was premiéred in December 1892, and sets the toy-like, playful tone of the work. Interestingly, this overture does not include any lower strings at all – with only violas and violins performing from the string section, with little bass at all in the orchestra.\nThe Dances follow, with six short dances, from act two, grouped into one larger movement. The famous March opens the movement, before introducing the iconic Dance of the sugar-plum fairy, which used the newly-invented Celeste, almost a cross between a glockenspiel and a piano. Tchaikovsky saw a Celeste for the first time the year before, and wrote to his publisher asking for one – but to keep it a secret… he wanted to be the first to use it. Next, the Russian Dance is followed by the gentle Arabian Dance and the rhythmic Chinese Dance, famous for its difficult, impressive choreography. The Dance of the Mirlitons closes the movement, which is the longest dance by far, using a gentle flute trio for its main motif.\nTchaikovsky closes the suite with the Waltz of the Flowers, a prime example of romantic music. The gentle arpeggio-based melody is introduced by the woodwind section, before a graceful harp cadenza links the Waltz into the music. This is the longest movement by far, with 353 bars, taking around 12 minutes, before bringing the hurriedly-prepared suite to a dignified close.\n\nDocument 10: About this Piece\nIf Stravinsky was known at all in Paris in 1908, it was as a promising student and disciple of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. In that year, two of the 26-year-old composer's works were conducted by Alexander Siloti in St. Petersburg: Scherzo fantastique and Fireworks. Hardly earth-shakers by the lights of what was to come, but sufficiently original and imaginative to make an impression on at least one connoisseur in the audience, Sergei Diaghilev, who was about to launch a new company to perform a mixed season of ballet and opera in Paris. The French capital was at the time particularly taken with the kind of exotic orientalia Russian artists were likely to offer.\nWith dancer-choreographer Mikhail Fokine and scenic artists Leon Bakst and Alexandre Benois on board, Diaghilev lacked only a resident composer to round out his creative staff. That Stravinsky was his man was proven by his successful handling of some test assignments for the opening season of what would be called the Ballets Russes, including the orchestration of Chopin's piano Nocturne in A-flat and Valse brillante in E-flat, for the opening and closing numbers of Fokine's Les Sylphides.\nDuring the company's second season, in 1909, Diaghilev gave his potential resident composer something more demanding. When Anatol Liadov was unable to make much progress on a score commissioned from him for a ballet on the Russian legend of the magical Firebird and the Tsarevich Ivan, Diaghilev transferred the project to Stravinsky, who was at the time living in the country home, near St. Petersburg, of the Rimsky-Korsakov family at the invitation of the late composer's son, Andrei.\nThe lavish production of L'oiseau de feu, as it was called, was first seen in the Paris Opera on June 25, 1910. Choreography was by Fokine, who also danced the role of the Tsarevich. The Firebird was Tamara Karsavina and the conductor Gabriel Pierné, himself a well-known composer at the time.\nThe colorfully melodic score made an overnight star of the composer who would scandalize even the most progressive Paris audience three years later with his Rite of Spring.\n\nDocument 11: Maurice Ravel – Daybreak (Daphnis et Chloé)\nDaphnis et Chloé is a ballet with music by Maurice Ravel. Ravel described it as a “symphonie choréographique” (choreographic symphony). The scenario was adapted by Michel Fokine from an eponymous romance by the Greek writer Longus thought to date from around the 2nd century AD. Scott Goddard published a contemporary commentary that discussed the changes to the story that Fokine made to prepare a workable ballet scenario.The story concerns the love between the goatherd Daphnis and the shepherdess Chloé. The ballet is in one act and three scenes.\nRavel began work on the score in 1909 after a commission from Sergei Diaghilev. It was premiered at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris by his Ballets Russes on June 8, 1912. The orchestra was conducted by Pierre Monteux, the choreography was by Michel Fokine, and Vaslav Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina danced the parts of Daphnis and Chloe. Léon Bakst designed the original sets.\nThe work is written for a large orchestra consisting of piccolo, 2 flutes (2nd flute also doubling piccolo), alto flute, 2 oboes, English horn, E-flat clarinet, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, tam-tam, wind machine, triangle, bass drum, field drum, castanets, tambourine, celesta, crotales, glockenspiel, 2 harps, wordless choir and strings in eight parts.When Diaghilev took the ballet to London in 1914, he omitted the chorus, which prompted Ravel to send an angry letter to The Times newspaper (see editions of June 9, 10 and 17).\nAt almost an hour long, Daphnis et Chloé is Ravel’s longest work.\n\nDocument 12: The Joffrey Ballet Resurrects The Rite of Spring\n\"[The Rite of Spring] is an astonishing ballet, no less so today than in 1913. Nijinsky's genius as a choreographer bursts forth here in the originality of his vision, the depth of his musicality and the grand sense of inevitability that reigns over the whole. Inspired by Roerich, a specialist in the primitive iconography of pagan Russia, Nijinsky created a movement style that would embody both the logic and the frenzy of Stravinsky's music.\"\n-- Newsweek November 16, 1987\nWhen Sergei Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes premiered The Rite of Spring, or Le Sacre du printemps (Sacre), at Paris's Theatre des Champs-Elysees on May 29, 1913, a riot broke out. The score by Igor Stravinsky was a panoply of shifting syncopations and dissonant harmonies, while the choreography by famed danseur Vaslav Nijinsky curled the dancers' bodies inward as they jerkily stamped and jumped across the stage. Archaeologist and painter Nicholas Roerich contributed the set design and the costumes, which were described in a 2002 Ballet Magazine article as \"heavy smocks, handpainted with [primitive] symbols of circles and squares.\" The pre-Modernist audience, accustomed to the demure grace of classical ballet, was further outraged by the graphic nature of the ballet's story--the pagan sacrifice of a virgin by her village to usher in spring. Nijinsky's ballet was performed only seven more times--in Paris and London-- before disappearing from the classical repertoire for reasons including Nijinsky's mental breakdown and the deterioration of his relationship with Diaghilev. Many new iterations of the ballet were choreographed--including versions by Pina Bausch and Martha Graham--but only the score remained intact from the initial performances. In FY 1987, the Joffrey Ballet received a National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grant in Dance of $243,400 \"to support three self-produced seasons in New York City and Los Angeles, and the reconstruction of Vaslav Nijinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps.\"\n\nDocument 13: It was not resuscitated until 1895, two years after Tchaikovsky’s death, when it was completely reset by the famous French-Russian choreographer Marius Petipa. But the revival was fraught with difficulties: Petipa, then over 70 and in poor health, delegated the lakeside scenes to his assistant Lev Ivanov, and the conductor, Riccardo Drigo, altered and shortened Tchaikovsky’s score. The tragic ending was replaced by a happier conclusion, and the action compressed from four acts into three. The original Siegfried, Pavel Gerdt, was too old for heavy lifting and had to be assisted on stage by a sidekick, Benno, whose presence in the intimate pas de deux with Odette turned it into an awkward pas de trois. Nevertheless, in this compromised form, Swan Lake became a big hit.\nThe work’s later history was no less complicated. In 1909 Swan Lake was greatly abridged for performance at the London Hippodrome. In 1950 Konstantin Sergeyev created a Socialist version for the Kirov Ballet, killing the sorcerer Rothbart at the end so that Odette and Siegfried could be united on earth, not in heaven—an allegory for the worldly triumph of the Soviet Union. A few years later in Moscow Swan Lake was used as a revenge vehicle for ballerina Maya Plisetskaya, whose triumphant performance with the Bolshoi Ballet forced the KGB to allow her to tour in the West. In the 1960s Kenneth MacMillan produced a Berlin Swan Lake filled with psychological probing, while back in Moscow Yuri Grigorovich presented another Soviet rendition emphasizing the emotional struggle between good and evil, with Siegfried and Rothbart as the protagonists. During the Cold War Swan Lake became Russia’s de facto national anthem, used by the Communist party as proof of Soviet cultural supremacy. Nikita Khrushchev complained that he was forced to attend so many performances that his dreams were haunted by “white tutus and tanks, all mixed together.” As we learn in the pages of Apollo’s Angels, Aronofsky is in good company using Swan Lake as a vehicle for his own agenda.\n\nDocument 14: Warburg, the School of American Ballet opened to students on January 2, 1934, less than 3 months after Balanchine arrived in the U.S. Later that year, Balanchine had his students perform in a recital, where they premiered his new work Serenade to music by Tchaikovsky at the Warburg summer estate.\nRelocation to West Coast\nBalanchine relocated his company to Hollywood during 1938, where he rented a white two-story house with \"Kolya\", Nicholas Kopeikine, his \"rehearsal pianist and lifelong colleague\", on North Fairfax Avenue not far from Hollywood Boulevard. Balanchine created dances for five movies, all of which featured Vera Zorina, whom he met on the set of The Goldwyn Follies and who subsequently became his third wife. He reconvened the company as the American Ballet Caravan and toured with it throughout North and South America, but it folded after several years. From 1944 to 1946, during and after World War II, Balanchine served as resident choreographer for Blum & Massine's new iteration of Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.\nReturn to New York\nSoon Balanchine formed a new dance company, Ballet Society, again with the generous help of Lincoln Kirstein. He continued to work with contemporary composers, such as Paul Hindemith, from whom he commissioned a score in 1940 for The Four Temperaments. First performed on November 20, 1946, this modernist work was one of his early abstract and spare ballets, angular and very different in movement. After several successful performances, the most notable featuring the ballet Orpheus created in collaboration with Stravinsky and sculptor and designer Isamu Noguchi, the City of New York offered the company residency at the New York City Center.\nIn 1955, Balanchine created his version of The Nutcracker, in which he played the mime role of Drosselmeyer. The company has since performed the ballet every year in New York City during the Christmas season.\nAfter years of illness, Balanchine died on April 30, 1983, aged 79, in Manhattan from Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which was diagnosed only after his death. He first showed symptoms during 1978 when he began losing his balance while dancing.\n\nDocument 15: Even though Balanchine's choreography was produced by Diaghilev in Paris in June 1928, Stravinsky's composition premiered six weeks earlier at the Library of Congress with choreography by Adolph Bolm. The events surrounding this premiere are telling.\nIn 1925 Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge created a festival to promote modern music and cultural awareness in America. An idealist, she maintained that public exposure to good new music was essential to a powerful society, and her aim was to build an auditorium for the Library of Congress to support these goals.\nMrs. Coolidge donated $60,000 to the Library to build the theater and develop the project. She established an annual chamber music festival and commissioned her favorite international composers to create original works. For the third season in 1928, Coolidge determined that she wanted to plan a program with dance as a central focus, and she requested that Carl Engel, chief of the Music Division, contact Adolph Bolm to be choreographer.\nTwo composers, de Falla and Ottorino Respighi, declined the commission, and in 1927 Coolidge contacted Stravinsky to compose a chamber ballet that would be performed at the festival. She set many parameters, requiring that the chamber ballet be 30 minutes in length and employ no more than six dancers and a modest orchestration so that the work would be accommodated on the Coolidge Auditorium's small stage. For this commission, Stravinsky created \"Apollon Musagète\" with choreography by Bolm. Nicholas Remisoff designed the costumes and scenery, and the dancers included Bolm as Apollo, and Ruth Page, Elise Reiman and Berenice Holmes as the Muses. This ballet was announced as \"the first time in history a major ballet work had its world premiere in America.\"\nNonetheless, Bolm's \"Apollo\" was beset with difficulties, ranging from Stravinsky's cavalier and egocentric treatment of the project to the limitations of the stage size and the small audience capacity. In fact, Stravinsky barely refers to Bolm's version of \"Apollo\" in any of his memoirs.\nCharles M. Joseph, author of \"Stravinsky Inside Out,\" states that according to some of Stravinsky's unpublished correspondence, he may have doubted Bolm's choreographic capabilities and convictions in the late 1920s.\n\nQuestion: When and where was Stravinsky's ballet suite, which rearranged Pergolesi's work, first performed?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Stravinsky's ballet suite, Pulcinella, which rearranged Pergolesi's work, was first performed in Paris, France, at the Opéra in May 1920. This performance marked the debut of Stravinsky's innovative adaptation of Pergolesi's compositions, blending historical elements with modern musical techniques. The premiere was a significant event in the musical world, showcasing Stravinsky's ability to reinterpret and revitalize older works with contemporary flair."}

In the case of India, for example, such an area covers a huge expanse of the Indian Ocean, bordering Indonesia in the east to Somalia in the west.\nA country cannot cover such vast space from its coastal radar stations, nor can it commit manned patrol flights to cover the entire area.\nAt Aero-India 2013, Israel’s Elbit Systems is introducing its newest and largest UAS, the Hermes-900, in a configuration adapted for maritime missions. This UAS can carry payloads of up to 350kg.\nIn the maritime configuration the payload suite includes maritime surveillance radar, an electro-optical multi-sensor payload and electronic surveillance systems.

U.S. Navy photo\nIn 2013 the Navy announced the follow-on Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program to develop a stealthy surveillance and attack drone. But camps within the Navy quarreled over UCLASS’s mission set.\nShould UCLASS primarily fly surveillance mission in lightly-defended air space, like the Air Force’s Reaper drone does? Or should it be capable of penetrating enemy defenses in order to attack heavily-defended targets? “You can’t afford both, you have to make your bet,” Bob Work, a former Navy undersecretary who would serve as deputy defense secretary, said in 2013.\nThe Navy placed its bet in early 2016. Rather than optimizing UCLASS for surveillance or strike, it chose an entirely separate mission. Rebranded as the Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System, the former UCLASS, ex-J-UCAS program would develop a tanker.\nCritics were displeased. “The Navy suppressed the best promise for innovation in this generation,” Dr. Monte Turner and Air Force lieutenant colonel Douglas Wickert wrote in a 2016 paper for National Defense University.\nNorthrop competed with Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Atomics for the CBARS contract. As the requirements drifted away from stealth and instead emphasized endurance and fuel capacity, Northrop decided to drop out. Boeing’s new design has almost nothing in common with the company’s J-UCAS-era X-45.\nIn contrast to the X-45’s and X-47’s flying-wing configuration, Boeing’s MQ-25 is a straight-wing, twin-tail design. But its conventional planform belies its evolution across multiple programs that shifted in emphasis from attack to surveillance to tanking.

That didn’t really begin to change until the 21st century (see April 2005, “USN, DARPA See Blimps & HULAs Rising“). The heavy-lift WALRUS project may have been canceled without explanation; but aerostat programs like JLENS cruise missile defense and its smaller RAID local surveillance derivative, and airships like the HAA/ISIS program, remain. The US Navy is also experimenting with aerostats for communications relay, surveillance, and radar overwatch functions – and this has become a formal program.\nWhat’s driving this interest? Four things. One is persistence, in an era where constant surveillance + rapid precision strike creates a formidable military asset. A second is cost, especially in an era of rising fuel prices. A recent US NAVSEA release offers figures that starkly illustrate the gap in surveillance cost per hour between an aerostat and planes or UAVs:\n- Land-based 71-meter aerostat: about $610/ hour\n- MQ-1 Predator MALE (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) UAV: about $5,000/ hour\n- E-2C Hawkeye AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) aircraft: about $18,000/ hour\n- RQ-4 Global Hawk HALE (High Altitude, Long Endurance) UAV: about $26,500/ hour\nThe third driver is ballooning bandwidth demands due to increased employment of UAVs and other systems with streaming video. This is a long-term trend that will demand very expensive satellites with long design/launch times – or cheaper patchwork solutions that can remain at altitude for long periods.\nThe fourth driver is the proliferation and increased lethality of cruise missiles. On land, the concern is the combination of cruise missiles and weapons of mass destruction. At sea, the concern is the increasing lethality of anti-ship cruise missiles, including supersonic varieties that place a premium on early detection in order to give defensive systems enough time.\nAerostats are not blimps, and need no pilot. These helium filled, multi-chambered balloons are winched up or down via a combined tether/power line; and can be deployed from trucks, land platforms, or a ship at sea.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:4167226f-288f-4705-9c82-55b5d5a0649b>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Since then, there have been a number of high profile aquatic acquisitions, including: Riptide Autonomous Solutions by BAE Systems; Liquid Robotics by Boeing; and multiple investments in Ocean Aero by Lockheed Martin. The biggest driver of this consolidation is the demand from the military, particularly the Navy, for autonomous searching out and destroy missions.\nIn September 2017 the US Navy established the Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron 1 (UUVRON-1). When explaining this move, Captain Robert Gaucher stated “Standing up UUVRON 1 shows our Navy’s commitment to the future of unmanned systems and undersea combat.” This sentiment was shared by Commander Corey Barker, spokesman of the famed Submarine Force Pacific, “In addition to providing a rapid, potentially lower cost solution to a variety of mission sets, UUVs can mitigate operations that pose increased risk to manned platforms.” Last summer the Navy appointed a dedicated Commander of UUVRON-1, Scott Smith. In a recent interview, Smith opined his vision for sea drones, “Those missions that are too dangerous to put men on, or those missions that are too mundane and routine, but important ― like monitoring ― we’ll use them for those missions, as well. I don’t think we’ll ever replace the manned platform, but we’ll certainly augment them to a large degree.” It is this augmentation that is generating millions of dollars of defense contracts which are starting to spill over to private industry.\nBoston-based Dive Technologies, founded by a team of former BlueFin engineers, is building an innovative technology to broaden the use of unmanned marine systems. In speaking with its CEO this week, Jerry Sgobbo, he described nascent opportunities for his suite of innovations: “We see demand for offshore survey work in the U.S. increasing significantly as grid scale offshore wind farms are developed over the next decade. In particular, much of this work will take place in New England and mid-Atlantic waters.” Sgobbo is referring to the recent move by Rhode Island in constructing the first ever wind farm in the United States, capitalizing on the regions famous gale-force gusts. Based upon the success of the Block Island project, other states are quickly putting forth legislation to follow suit. Just this week, Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts declared in Congress that “Offshore wind has the potential to change the game on climate change, and those winds of change are blowing off the shores of Massachusetts.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:1f4ebe2c-caa7-47f0-b5b7-d79571cd50bd>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "Unmanned systems―surface and subsurface―become an important part of the fleet in this outline because of their ability to do dull and dangerous work within an adversary’s defensive bubble. Unmanned systems may also reduce the number of personnel required, or at least move personnel to less vulnerable and stressful locations. But unmanned systems do have limitations. They cannot perform some missions, such as engagement with allies and partners, humanitarian assistance, and certain kinds of crisis response. As unmanned vessels get larger, they may also lose their advantage over manned systems because of the complexity of operations. The major challenge, however, is that the Navy only has a single experimental unmanned surface vessel operating today. How unmanned systems will operate in the fleet, whether the network can handle the bandwidth, and where unmanned surface vessels will be based are all unanswered questions. These unmanned surface and subsurface vessels may not count as “ships.” The Navy has official ship-counting rules, set by an agreement between the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense back in the 1980s with occasional updates, most recently in 2016. Some unmanned vessels might not be counted under these rules because of their small size. In the past, Congress has been reluctant to change the counting rules, seeing this as a way of cutting the Navy while keeping the appearance of size.Large/Small Surface Combatants Under this plan, the number of small combatants (currently littoral combat ships but in the future frigates) increase because of their lower cost and ability to provide distributed capabilities. They provide a secondary benefit of increasing total fleet numbers, therefore allowing the Navy to be present in more places globally. Large combatants (cruisers and destroyers) were not discussed, but other sources put the number at 80-90.Combat Logistics Ships The fleet will include more logistics ships, between 70 and 90, to deal with an environment in which they are threatened by adversaries for the first time in 70 years. Other sources indicate that the Navy will procure smaller logistics ships because they are harder to locate, and a single loss is less catastrophic.Aircraft Aircraft were not the focus of the presentation, but Esper did make an interesting side point, saying that the plan included unmanned ship-based aircraft of all types, fighters, refuelers, early warning, and electronic attack aircraft.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:76470de3-0126-4c6d-9b0a-dd79cb820779>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "Home Tags ONR\nAs robotic machines become intelligent and autonomous, human-machine and machine-machine teaming (MUMT and Swarms) will become the norm in military operations - a trend that military planners already address in their forecast, research and development roadmaps.\nAurora Flight Sciences will integrate the Tactical Autonomous Aerial Logistics System (TALOS) on a UH-1H helicopter for capability demonstration to the US Navy and Marine Corps, flight demonstrations of the unmanned, autonomous Huey are planned in 2017-2018.\nGeneral Motors, the Office of Naval Research and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory announced Thursday, June 23, 2016; they are cooperating to incorporate automotive hydrogen fuel cell systems into a next-generation of Navy unmanned undersea vehicles, or UUVs.\nThe US Office of Naval Research (ONR) unveiled some of the most advanced unmanned and autonomous systems developed today, that could introduce new concepts of warfare in the years to come.\nDARPA is expecting to complete risk reduction studies in September, and select one of two competing designs for medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aerial systems (MALE UAS), to demonstrate drone operations from small and medium naval vessels by 2017.\nThe US Navy announced the successfully deployment of the laser weapon system (LaWS) aboard USS Ponce (AFSB[I] 15) that operated with other naval vessel in the Arabian Gulf.

In the long run, the enlisted UAV \"pilots\" will probably be superior, because they are making a career of this sort of thing.\nUnlike the traditional \"pilot and crew\" arrangement for aircraft, larger UAVs, like the Predator, are operated by a team. Typically, a Predator is attended to by a pilot and two sensor operators (NCOs), who monitor what the cameras and other sensors are picking up. Because a Predator is often in the air for 24 hours at a time, and is often flying over an active battlefield, and is looking real hard for specific stuff, the \"crew\" has to be changed every 4-6 hours to avoid fatigue. Moreover, each Predator unit might have several UAVs in the air at once.

The pilots also operate the weapons, if any of the Predators are carrying missiles. But most of the time, Predators fly missions without using missiles.\nWhile refusing to let NCOs operate UAVs, the air force has compromised and allowed officers to make a career of it.

Currently all unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), even those for private use, must be registered with the FAA, and there are certain operational restrictions that an unmanned aircraft systems operator (UAS operator) must follow. However, there are currently no federal restrictions that would prevent a UAS from flying over residential areas.\nLaws That Protect Drones\nSome may be tempted to try and knock one of these unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) out of the sky, especially if it seems to be infringing on your privacy.

In the case of India, for example, such an area covers a huge expanse of the Indian Ocean, bordering Indonesia in the east to Somalia in the west.\nA country cannot cover such vast space from its coastal radar stations, nor can it commit manned patrol flights to cover the entire area.\nAt Aero-India 2013, Israel’s Elbit Systems is introducing its newest and largest UAS, the Hermes-900, in a configuration adapted for maritime missions. This UAS can carry payloads of up to 350kg.\nIn the maritime configuration the payload suite includes maritime surveillance radar, an electro-optical multi-sensor payload and electronic surveillance systems. It has the endurance to cover vast ocean areas, redundant line-of-sight and satellite communications links and radio relays – enabling the operator to ‘talk through’ to vessels at sea.\n\nDocument 3: Under the auspices of the Unmanned Combat Air Systems Demonstration between 2007 and 2015, Northrop’s larger X-47B undertook the first carrier operations for a drone, including the first unmanned trap aboard a carrier in May 2013.\nAt top — the Boeing MQ-25. Boeing photo. Above — an X-47B takes off from the USS George W. Bush in 2013. U.S. Navy photo\nIn 2013 the Navy announced the follow-on Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program to develop a stealthy surveillance and attack drone. But camps within the Navy quarreled over UCLASS’s mission set.\nShould UCLASS primarily fly surveillance mission in lightly-defended air space, like the Air Force’s Reaper drone does? Or should it be capable of penetrating enemy defenses in order to attack heavily-defended targets? “You can’t afford both, you have to make your bet,” Bob Work, a former Navy undersecretary who would serve as deputy defense secretary, said in 2013.\nThe Navy placed its bet in early 2016. Rather than optimizing UCLASS for surveillance or strike, it chose an entirely separate mission. Rebranded as the Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System, the former UCLASS, ex-J-UCAS program would develop a tanker.\nCritics were displeased. “The Navy suppressed the best promise for innovation in this generation,” Dr. Monte Turner and Air Force lieutenant colonel Douglas Wickert wrote in a 2016 paper for National Defense University.\nNorthrop competed with Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Atomics for the CBARS contract. As the requirements drifted away from stealth and instead emphasized endurance and fuel capacity, Northrop decided to drop out. Boeing’s new design has almost nothing in common with the company’s J-UCAS-era X-45.\nIn contrast to the X-45’s and X-47’s flying-wing configuration, Boeing’s MQ-25 is a straight-wing, twin-tail design. But its conventional planform belies its evolution across multiple programs that shifted in emphasis from attack to surveillance to tanking. The roughly 60-foot-long drone boasts a top-mounted air-intake that’s flush with the fuselage, a low-observable design feature that Northrop experimented with in the 1980s its Tacit Blue demonstrator.\n\nDocument 4: Darpa looks to use small ships as drone bases\nThe US military is planning to use fleets of small ships as platforms for unmanned aircraft to land and take off.\nThe US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) said it needed to increase its airborne \"surveillance and reconnaissance\".\nUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), known as drones, are commonly launched on land - but deploying them at sea is harder because they need to refuel.\nThey currently require large aircraft carriers with long runways.\nThe new project has been dubbed Tern (Tactically Exploited Reconnaissance Node) after a sea-bird known for its endurance.\nDarpa programme manager Daniel Patt, said: \"Enabling small ships to launch and retrieve long-endurance UAVs on demand would greatly expand our situational awareness and our ability to quickly and flexibly engage in hotspots over land or water.\"\nHe added: \"It is like having a falcon return to the arm of any person equipped to receive it, instead of to the same static perch every time.\"\nAbout 98% of the world's land area lies within 900 nautical miles of ocean coastlines, and Darpa increasingly sees conflicts being fought out at sea.\n\nDocument 5: Navy officer with Door County roots is leading unmanned surveillance aircraft mission\nELLISON BAY - A U.S. Navy officer with Door County roots has become the next commander of the Navy's new program to deploy unmanned surveillance aircraft.\nCommander John LeVoy, the son of Lee and Hugh LeVoy, of Ellison Bay, became the commanding officer of Unmanned Patrol Squadron 19 in a change of command ceremony June 5 aboard Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida.\nUnmanned Patrol Squadron 19 includes 300 sailors and 200 civilian contractors with the mission to fly two types of unmanned aerial vehicles, the MQ-4C Triton and RQ-4A Broad Area Maritime Surveillance-Demonstrator, according to a U.S. Navy news release.\n\"The change of command ceremony was wonderful,\" said Lee LeVoy. The couple was grateful to attend the event, she said.\nJohn LeVoy will lead the \"historic, first-ever flight of the MQ-4C Triton,\" the release said.\n\nDocument 6: The U.S. Navy plans to deploy unmanned aerial systems (UAS) on board submarines, to provide covert intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and target acquisition to support special operations and full-scale warfare, on sub-surface and surface operations. According to the Navy’s plans, attack and guided missile submarine will be equipped with a miniature UAS known as ‘Blackwing,’ produced by Aerovironment Inc. The Navy plans to buy 150 such systems. The company introduced the new unmanned vehicle at the Sea Air Space event in Washington DC.\nTypical operation will see the Blacking deployed in the vicinity of targets in contested or denied airspace, where activities of other manned or unmanned platforms would be too risky. From its forward position, the Blackwing will provide target acquisition and battle damage assessment, in support of strikes performed from stand-off range.\nDuring the demonstration phase (2013-2015) the AWESUM “demonstrates submarine launch, data sharing and control across naval, special operations and air-force units. Photo via Aerovironment Inc.\nAs part of the Fiscal Year 2017 budget submission to Congress, the Navy is asking for small Blackwing UAVs to be launched from attack and guided missile submarines, the Navy’s director for undersea warfare Rear Adm. Charles Richard told USNI News.\nSOURCES – Defense Update, USNI\n\nDocument 7: Return of the Navy Blimps?\nIn the aftermath of World War 2, blimps and airships found themselves gradually phased out of the US military. That didn’t really begin to change until the 21st century (see April 2005, “USN, DARPA See Blimps & HULAs Rising“). The heavy-lift WALRUS project may have been canceled without explanation; but aerostat programs like JLENS cruise missile defense and its smaller RAID local surveillance derivative, and airships like the HAA/ISIS program, remain. The US Navy is also experimenting with aerostats for communications relay, surveillance, and radar overwatch functions – and this has become a formal program.\nWhat’s driving this interest? Four things. One is persistence, in an era where constant surveillance + rapid precision strike creates a formidable military asset. A second is cost, especially in an era of rising fuel prices. A recent US NAVSEA release offers figures that starkly illustrate the gap in surveillance cost per hour between an aerostat and planes or UAVs:\n- Land-based 71-meter aerostat: about $610/ hour\n- MQ-1 Predator MALE (Medium Altitude, Long Endurance) UAV: about $5,000/ hour\n- E-2C Hawkeye AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) aircraft: about $18,000/ hour\n- RQ-4 Global Hawk HALE (High Altitude, Long Endurance) UAV: about $26,500/ hour\nThe third driver is ballooning bandwidth demands due to increased employment of UAVs and other systems with streaming video. This is a long-term trend that will demand very expensive satellites with long design/launch times – or cheaper patchwork solutions that can remain at altitude for long periods.\nThe fourth driver is the proliferation and increased lethality of cruise missiles. On land, the concern is the combination of cruise missiles and weapons of mass destruction. At sea, the concern is the increasing lethality of anti-ship cruise missiles, including supersonic varieties that place a premium on early detection in order to give defensive systems enough time.\nAerostats are not blimps, and need no pilot. These helium filled, multi-chambered balloons are winched up or down via a combined tether/power line; and can be deployed from trucks, land platforms, or a ship at sea.\n\nDocument 8: Since then, there have been a number of high profile aquatic acquisitions, including: Riptide Autonomous Solutions by BAE Systems; Liquid Robotics by Boeing; and multiple investments in Ocean Aero by Lockheed Martin. The biggest driver of this consolidation is the demand from the military, particularly the Navy, for autonomous searching out and destroy missions.\nIn September 2017 the US Navy established the Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron 1 (UUVRON-1). When explaining this move, Captain Robert Gaucher stated “Standing up UUVRON 1 shows our Navy’s commitment to the future of unmanned systems and undersea combat.” This sentiment was shared by Commander Corey Barker, spokesman of the famed Submarine Force Pacific, “In addition to providing a rapid, potentially lower cost solution to a variety of mission sets, UUVs can mitigate operations that pose increased risk to manned platforms.” Last summer the Navy appointed a dedicated Commander of UUVRON-1, Scott Smith. In a recent interview, Smith opined his vision for sea drones, “Those missions that are too dangerous to put men on, or those missions that are too mundane and routine, but important ― like monitoring ― we’ll use them for those missions, as well. I don’t think we’ll ever replace the manned platform, but we’ll certainly augment them to a large degree.” It is this augmentation that is generating millions of dollars of defense contracts which are starting to spill over to private industry.\nBoston-based Dive Technologies, founded by a team of former BlueFin engineers, is building an innovative technology to broaden the use of unmanned marine systems. In speaking with its CEO this week, Jerry Sgobbo, he described nascent opportunities for his suite of innovations: “We see demand for offshore survey work in the U.S. increasing significantly as grid scale offshore wind farms are developed over the next decade. In particular, much of this work will take place in New England and mid-Atlantic waters.” Sgobbo is referring to the recent move by Rhode Island in constructing the first ever wind farm in the United States, capitalizing on the regions famous gale-force gusts. Based upon the success of the Block Island project, other states are quickly putting forth legislation to follow suit. Just this week, Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts declared in Congress that “Offshore wind has the potential to change the game on climate change, and those winds of change are blowing off the shores of Massachusetts.\n\nDocument 9: Unmanned systems―surface and subsurface―become an important part of the fleet in this outline because of their ability to do dull and dangerous work within an adversary’s defensive bubble. Unmanned systems may also reduce the number of personnel required, or at least move personnel to less vulnerable and stressful locations. But unmanned systems do have limitations. They cannot perform some missions, such as engagement with allies and partners, humanitarian assistance, and certain kinds of crisis response. As unmanned vessels get larger, they may also lose their advantage over manned systems because of the complexity of operations. The major challenge, however, is that the Navy only has a single experimental unmanned surface vessel operating today. How unmanned systems will operate in the fleet, whether the network can handle the bandwidth, and where unmanned surface vessels will be based are all unanswered questions. These unmanned surface and subsurface vessels may not count as “ships.” The Navy has official ship-counting rules, set by an agreement between the Navy and the Office of the Secretary of Defense back in the 1980s with occasional updates, most recently in 2016. Some unmanned vessels might not be counted under these rules because of their small size. In the past, Congress has been reluctant to change the counting rules, seeing this as a way of cutting the Navy while keeping the appearance of size.Large/Small Surface Combatants Under this plan, the number of small combatants (currently littoral combat ships but in the future frigates) increase because of their lower cost and ability to provide distributed capabilities. They provide a secondary benefit of increasing total fleet numbers, therefore allowing the Navy to be present in more places globally. Large combatants (cruisers and destroyers) were not discussed, but other sources put the number at 80-90.Combat Logistics Ships The fleet will include more logistics ships, between 70 and 90, to deal with an environment in which they are threatened by adversaries for the first time in 70 years. Other sources indicate that the Navy will procure smaller logistics ships because they are harder to locate, and a single loss is less catastrophic.Aircraft Aircraft were not the focus of the presentation, but Esper did make an interesting side point, saying that the plan included unmanned ship-based aircraft of all types, fighters, refuelers, early warning, and electronic attack aircraft.\n\nDocument 10: Home Tags ONR\nAs robotic machines become intelligent and autonomous, human-machine and machine-machine teaming (MUMT and Swarms) will become the norm in military operations - a trend that military planners already address in their forecast, research and development roadmaps.\nAurora Flight Sciences will integrate the Tactical Autonomous Aerial Logistics System (TALOS) on a UH-1H helicopter for capability demonstration to the US Navy and Marine Corps, flight demonstrations of the unmanned, autonomous Huey are planned in 2017-2018.\nGeneral Motors, the Office of Naval Research and the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory announced Thursday, June 23, 2016; they are cooperating to incorporate automotive hydrogen fuel cell systems into a next-generation of Navy unmanned undersea vehicles, or UUVs.\nThe US Office of Naval Research (ONR) unveiled some of the most advanced unmanned and autonomous systems developed today, that could introduce new concepts of warfare in the years to come.\nDARPA is expecting to complete risk reduction studies in September, and select one of two competing designs for medium-altitude, long-endurance unmanned aerial systems (MALE UAS), to demonstrate drone operations from small and medium naval vessels by 2017.\nThe US Navy announced the successfully deployment of the laser weapon system (LaWS) aboard USS Ponce (AFSB[I] 15) that operated with other naval vessel in the Arabian Gulf. During the operational demonstrations that took place from September to November 2014 LaWS intercepted surface targets and unmanned aerial vehicles.\nThe US Navy is evaluating a technology controlling swarms of unmanned boats with high level of autonomy. The Office of Naval Research (ONR) has tested an applique kit that will allow any unmanned surface vehicle (USV) to not only protect Navy ships, but also, for the first time, autonomously “swarm” offensively on hostile vessels.\nA compact yet powerful laser weapon developed by Raytheon will soon be integrated on a HMMWV, to demonstrate its ability to defeat enemy drones, as part of the enhancement of current US Marine Corps ground-based air-defense capabilities.\n\nDocument 11: Only recently did UAVs become a distinct \"community\" in the air force, with an official job description.\nThe other services save a lot of money by using NCOs as UAV controllers. Sergeants and Petty Officers are paid less, and they don't get flight pay. No one has been able to demonstrate any better performance on the part of the air force pilots who operate UAVs. In the long run, the enlisted UAV \"pilots\" will probably be superior, because they are making a career of this sort of thing.\nUnlike the traditional \"pilot and crew\" arrangement for aircraft, larger UAVs, like the Predator, are operated by a team. Typically, a Predator is attended to by a pilot and two sensor operators (NCOs), who monitor what the cameras and other sensors are picking up. Because a Predator is often in the air for 24 hours at a time, and is often flying over an active battlefield, and is looking real hard for specific stuff, the \"crew\" has to be changed every 4-6 hours to avoid fatigue. Moreover, each Predator unit might have several UAVs in the air at once. The new software means that each shift needs only one pilot, for up to four airborne Predators, and up to eight sensor operators. The pilots also operate the weapons, if any of the Predators are carrying missiles. But most of the time, Predators fly missions without using missiles.\nWhile refusing to let NCOs operate UAVs, the air force has compromised and allowed officers to make a career of it. UAV operators have also been given flight pay, which has been justified by the fact that UAV operators suffer more stress and fatigue from the hours of staring at videos from their aircraft, constantly on the lookout for anything important. Meanwhile, new software (that detects images that might be of interest) will eventually reduce the stress somewhat. The air force has also found that non-pilot officers can also serve as effective UAV operators, and is training more of them for the job. But, at least for now, no NCOs.\n\nDocument 12: Increased Commercial Drone Use Raises Privacy and Safety Concerns\nPosted by PKSD Law Firm on September 9, 2020 in Personal Injury\nDrone technology, which was previously used with balloons, torpedoes and aerial targets, has been around since the mid-1800s. More recent technology was solely used by the military until 2006. The first commercial permits for drones were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to aid search efforts for survivors during natural disasters.\nToday, in addition to being part of search and rescue missions, drones are also heavily used to transport critical cargo and obtain data and images for:\n- Land surveillance\n- Law enforcement\n- Health care providers\n- Wildlife tracking\n- Disaster response teams\nDrones can provide deliveries where timing is crucial, such as for organ transplants. However, as with all useful technology, it is important to also understand what security risks they could pose.\nIn this month’s newsletter, PKSD discusses some important concerns, such as safety and privacy, that are arising out of the increased use of commercial and private drones.\nIs There Any Privacy Under Modern Technology’s Watchful Eye?\nMany people have concerns about how drones will affect their privacy. Currently all unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), even those for private use, must be registered with the FAA, and there are certain operational restrictions that an unmanned aircraft systems operator (UAS operator) must follow. However, there are currently no federal restrictions that would prevent a UAS from flying over residential areas.\nLaws That Protect Drones\nSome may be tempted to try and knock one of these unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) out of the sky, especially if it seems to be infringing on your privacy. However, it is a federal crime to knock down or even jam the signal of a drone or any other aircraft regulated by the FAA.\nRisks to Physical Safety\nAs the usefulness of drones increases, our Milwaukee personal injury lawyers are concerned not just about the impact to our privacy, but also the safety issues. The list of possible threats to physical safety is a long one, especially because of the various places a small unmanned UAS can go. Since 2014, the Golden Gate Bridge roadway has already sustained five drone crashes, even though flying a UAS through a National Park is illegal.\nThere are additional concerns that drones could intentionally or unintentionally crash into crowds of people, collide with manned aircraft or breach sensitive security perimeters.\nWhat are the Safety Guidelines?\n\nDocument 13: If I had $1 for every time Tony Abbott had said “stop the boats” in the last four years, I’d probably have enough cash to fund his latest proposal: he wants to buy seven UAV drones to scour the Australian coastline for illegal boat arrivals at a cost of $1.5 billion.\nNote: this story originally ran in April 2013, but has now been updated to reflect the Coalition’s policy documents.\nAbbott proposed the plan in the wake of the arrival of a boatload of 66 asylum seekers into Geraldton, Western Australia without being detected by Australian Customs or the Navy. A rather embarrassing affair for all involved, really.\nThe leader of the Opposition said that the plan would cost $1.5 billion and be operational by 2017-18.\n“We do need unmanned aerial vehicles to ensure that we’ve got proper surveillance over the approaches to Australia. We have got a government which has essentially surrendered to the people smugglers on the task of border protection. We will fix this problem. We will make our borders safe again,” Abbott told SBS.\nIt’s worth noting that these probably won’t be the weaponised drones you see patrolling warzones in the Middle East, for example. This plan is about high-level border surveillance to augment the capacity of the Navy and the Customs Service.\nDrones are already used around Australia’s coastline to look for illegal fishing boats in Australian waters, but this plan is far more expensive and expansive.\nTony Abbott today outed his Defence Policy documents [PDF], which included a very broad paragraph on the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for border patrol.\n4. Broad Area Maritime Unmanned Aerial Vehicles\nThe Coalition’s Defence White Paper will closely consider the need for unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles.\nThe acquisition of unmanned aerial vehicles will be dependent on the advice of the Chief of the Defence Force and Service Chiefs, as well as a clear cost-benefit assessment that demonstrates the value of these aircraft.\nWe believe there is merit in acquiring new state-of-the-art unmanned aerial vehicles ― such as the Triton or equivalent capability. Australia lost its pre-eminent position in the Triton programme and delivery schedule because of Labor’s ill thought-out decision in 2009 to delay this programme to 2022-23.\nUnmanned aircraft have the speed, technology and endurance to conduct surveillance over Australia’s vast land and maritime jurisdictions.\n\nDocument 14: After 20 Years, the U.S. Navy Finally Buys a Carrier Drone\nHow will the MQ-25 evolve?\nThe U.S. Navy on Aug. 30, 2018 chose Chicago-based Boeing to build the sailing branch’s first carrier-launched unmanned aerial vehicle.\nIn choosing Boeing to build the MQ-25 Stingray multi-mission tanker, the Navy has opened the next major chapter in a story that began in the mid-1990s, when the sailing branch worked alongside the U.S. Air Force to develop a fighter-like drone.\nBoeing will build the first four MQ-25s under the initial $805-million contract for integration in a carrier air wing in 2024. The Navy could buy as many as 72 MQ-25s worth as much as $13 billion to serve as the main tanker aircraft for carrier air wings, freeing up the F/A-18E/F Super Hornets that currently perform the role.\n“When operational, MQ-25 will improve the performance, efficiency and safety of the carrier air wing and provide longer range and greater persistence tanking capability to execute missions that otherwise could not be performed,” the Navy stated.\nThe MQ-25 could evolve to fill additional roles, potentially including surveillance and strike. The single-engine jet’s stealthy airframe — a product of its long, contentious development — could prove to be an advantage in those roles.\nIn the mid-1990s the Navy and Air Force worked together on the Joint Unmanned Air Combat Sytems program, or J-UCAS — an effort to co-develop a stealthy and highly-autonomous fighter drone.\nBoeing and Northrop Grumman both built J-UCAS demonstrators. Boeing’s X-45 and Northrop’s X-47 were wedge-shaped, flying-wing designs, each around 40 feet in length. The X-45 with its proprietary mission software in particular demonstrated a high degree of autonomy in ground-attack missions.\nBut J-UCAS collapsed in 2006 when the Air Force chose to shift resources to the F-22 and F-35 manned fighters. The Navy salvaged Northrop’s rugged X-47 demonstrator from the J-UCAS program.\n\nDocument 15: CH-53K, K3, piloted by Mr. Rob Pupalaikis and Maj.

Read More\n\nDocument 16: MONROVIA, Calif., AeroVironment (NASDAQ: AVAV) announced that the U.S. Marine Corps is the first military service to adopt four different small unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) from the company with the receipt of a firm fixed-price order valued at $5,558,479 for the RQ-20A Puma AE™ through an existing U.S. Army contract. Delivery is scheduled within two weeks\n“The Marine Corps was the first military service to formalize the adoption of small unmanned aircraft systems and is now the first to adopt four of our systems, recognizing the life-saving value of this capability,” said Tom Herring, AeroVironment senior vice president and general manager of its Unmanned Aircraft Systems business segment. “When time is shortest and risk is highest, small UAS deliver critical information that helps troops do their jobs more safely and effectively.”\nIn 2003, the Marine Corps became the first U.S. military service to establish a program of record for small unmanned aircraft systems with their competitive selection of AeroVironment’s RQ-14 Dragon Eye for the Small Unit Remote Scouting System (SURSS) program. In 2007, the Marines procured AeroVironment Wasp systems and then replaced their Dragon Eye fleet with AeroVironment’s RQ-11B Raven system starting in 2009. With the procurement of Puma systems the Marine Corps is the first service to adopt four different AeroVironment small UAS.\nThe United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) selected the Puma UAS in 2008 for its AECV program after a full and open competition, the fourth U.S. Department of Defense competition for programs of record involving small UAS and the fourth such competition won by AeroVironment. In 2011 the United States Army assumed management of the AECV program. Each Puma system consists of three air vehicles and two ground control systems. The air vehicle carries an integrated electro-optical and infrared gimbaled video camera, is designed for enhanced survivability in land and maritime environments, and can operate effectively in foul weather and over rugged terrain. Its quiet operation, stabilized imagery and precision landing capability make Puma systems easy to operate and recover. The Puma air vehicle weighs 13 pounds, is battery powered and has a flight endurance of two hours.\n\nQuestion: How has aerial surveillance in the Navy changed with the introduction of unmanned vehicles?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "The introduction of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the Navy has significantly transformed aerial surveillance capabilities. UAVs have become integral to maritime surveillance, providing persistent coverage over vast ocean areas and extending the reach of carrier strike groups beyond the limitations of manned aircraft. These unmanned systems offer several advantages over traditional manned platforms, including reduced risk to personnel, lower operational costs, and the ability to conduct missions in hazardous or denied environments.\n\nThe Navy has increasingly relied on UAVs for a variety of missions, from ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) to strike operations, and has established dedicated units such as Unmanned Patrol Squadron 19 to operate these systems. Moreover, the Navy's acquisition of the MQ-25 Stingray, a carrier-based tanker drone, marks a significant step in integrating UAVs into its core operational capabilities. Overall, the adoption of UAVs in the Navy has expanded the scope and effectiveness of aerial surveillance, enabling more efficient and safer operations across a range of maritime missions.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of UAVs into naval operations has revolutionized aerial surveillance, offering enhanced capabilities and operational flexibility. This transformation underscores the Navy's commitment to leveraging cutting-edge technology to maintain its strategic edge in maritime security."}

Such an atmosphere -- with a surface pressure equal to or less than that found on Earth -- could have evolved into the current thin one, not only minus the \"missing\" carbon problem, but also in a way consistent with the observed ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12, which differ only by how many neutrons are in each nucleus.\n\"Our paper shows that transitioning from a moderately dense atmosphere to the current thin one is entirely possible,\" says Caltech postdoctoral fellow Renyu Hu, the lead author. \"It is exciting that what we know about the Martian atmosphere can now be pieced together into a consistent picture of its evolution -- and this does not require a massive undetected carbon reservoir.\"\nWhen considering how the early Martian atmosphere might have transitioned to its current state, there are two possible mechanisms for the removal of the excess carbon dioxide. Either the carbon dioxide was incorporated into minerals in rocks called carbonates or it was lost to space.\nAn August 2015 study used data from several Mars-orbiting spacecraft to inventory carbonates, showing there are nowhere near enough in the upper half mile (one kilometer) or the crust to contain the missing carbon from a thick early atmosphere during a time when networks of ancient river channels were active, about 3.8 billion years ago.\nThe escaped-to-space scenario has also been problematic.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:27222da7-0111-4cc6-8d19-ff817878a0d6>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Did Mars become more habitable over time all thanks to the collisions it has endured from large space rocks like asteroids and comets?\nIn a study documented in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters, scientists reveal that these impacts may be some of the leading factors in why Mars has such a habitable temperature range and flowing water among other potential life-supporting features.\nThe scientists used 3D computer modelling to predict what happened to the planet and its living conditions during the times of these impacts.\nAlthough there are still no traces of complex life on Mars, or any other planet in our solar system for that matter, it is believed that the living conditions on Mars are constantly changing due to these impacts and the conditions there may be just right for life forms to begin emerging, just like they magically did here on Earth.\nThe remnants of flowing water found on Mars may be that of melted ice from a once-wet planet that has evaporated from the lack of a protective magnetic field against solar activity, and all of that water may have been brought there by way of space rocks.\nThe activity from these spatial bodies smacking the planet millions of years ago also would have warmed the planet up.

These days any liquid water on the surface would boil due to the low pressure or freeze due to the low temperature (or maybe do both at the same time!).\nTo explain liquid water on the past, there has been a lot of work done to see whether a thicker atmosphere of CO2 could provide high enough pressure and temperature to allow stable water. Today Marc Hirschmann gave an interesting talk about whether volcanoes could give off enough gas to do the job.\nIt turns out that since the sun was dimmer in the past, and since Mars is farther from the sun than the Earth, the early CO2 atmosphere of mars would have to be several times as thick as Earth’s current atmosphere to keep liquid water stable at the surface. Hirscmann estimated how much volcanism there was on Mars based on the heat flow from the planet, and then calculated the amount of CO2 released based on the amount of carbon in the mantle. Hirschmann showed that on Mars, with the amount of oxygen available to react with rocks (the so-called “oxygen fugacity”), the carbon in many lavas would likely be in the form of graphite, or even diamonds deep in the mantle where the pressure is higher.\nWith reasonable estimates of the amount of volcanism and the amount of carbon in the lavas, Hirschmann estimated that even in the “best case” scenario, volcanism can only provide an atmosphere with 0.1 bars of CO2: only a tenth of Earth’s atmospheric pressure and not nearly enough to make Mars warm. This led Hirschmann to look at the possibility of CO2 from the formation and stabilization of the crust. Depending on the assumptions you make, this process can give either 10s of bars of CO2, or a negligible amount.\nHirschmann concluded that if crust formation was the source of a thick atmosphere, it would require the most extreme limits of likely conditions. Alternatively, a CO2 atmosphere could have somehow persisted from the very earliest period of martian evolution, when the planet had a “magma ocean”.

This suggests, researchers say, that the early Martian surface was full of oxygen. The findings have been published in the journal Nature.\n\"What we have shown is that both meteorites and surface volcanic rocks are consistent with similar origins in the deep interior of Mars but that the surface rocks come from a more oxygen-rich environment, probably caused by recycling of oxygen-rich materials into the interior,\" said Bernard Wood, a co-author of the study and a professor in Oxford University's Department of Earth Sciences. \"This result is surprising because while the meteorites are geologically 'young', around 180 million to 1,400 million years old, the Spirit rover was analysing a very old part of Mars, more than 3,700 million years old.\"\nWood and his colleagues believe that the different compositions of the Martian material may be due to subduction, the process by which surface material is recycled into a planet's interior. The hypothesis is that Mars was very oxidized early in its history, and that subduction has brought early surface material to where Spirit found it, while the meteorites are younger Martian material from deeper within the planet.\n\"The implication is that Mars had an oxygen-rich atmosphere at a time, about 4000 million years ago, well before the rise of atmospheric oxygen on earth around 2500 million years ago,\" said Wood. \"As oxidation is what gives Mars its distinctive colour it is likely that the 'red planet' was wet, warm, and rusty billions of years before Earth's atmosphere became oxygen rich.\"\n\nDocument 7: Mars has lost at least half its atmosphere since the planet’s inception, Curiosity confirms. Mars’ atmosphere is 100 times thinner than Earth’s. Other than shielding life from harmful UV radiation, atmosphere also controls the fluctuations in climate. Because Mars’ atmosphere contains more heavier varieties of carbon dioxide than lighter ones, the ratio suggest the planet has sadly lost much of its atmosphere. Mars’ thin atmosphere has nearly untraceable amounts of methane, only a few parts of methane per billion parts of Martian atmosphere. Microbes like bacteria emit methane. In fact, 95% of methane on Earth is produced by biological processes. Though Curiosity failed to find traces of methane in Gale Crater, Mars may yet host methane elsewhere.\nCuriosity used its SAM instruments (Sample Analysis at Mars) and TLS (Tunable Laser Spectrometer). In the near future, SAM will analyze its first solid sample to search for organic compounds in rocks.\nIn addition, air samples from Curiosity match ones from trapped air bubbles in meteorites found on Earth. Ergo, those meteorites definitely originated from Mars. 1 billion years ago, a large asteroid collided into Mars and split into fragments.\nThe latest of Curiosity’s analyses show that the Martian minerals is similar to “weathered basaltic salts of volcanic origin in Hawaii.” Curiosity’s CheMin (Chemistry and Mineralogy) instrument refines and identifies minerals in X-ray diffraction analysis on Mars. X-ray diffraction records hows minerals’ internal structures’ crystals react with X-rays. Identifying minerals in rocks and soil is crucial in assessing past environmental conditions. Each mineral has evidence of its unique formation. These minerals have similar chemical compositions but different structures and properties. The samples taken at “Rocknest” were consistent with scientists’ initial ideas of the deposits in Gale Crater. Ancient rocks suggest flowing water, while minerals in younger soil suggest limited interaction with water.\n“NASA Rover’s First Soil Studies Help Fingerprint Martian Minerals First X-ray View of Martian Soil” JPL Caltech. JPL, 30 Oct 2012. Web. 5 Nov 2012.\nCuriosity first discovered “Jake Matijevic,” the pyramid rock on Mars, on September 19, 2012, but on October 11, 2012, NASA released a report on the chemical composition of this unusual rock.\n\nDocument 8: There is no liquid water, but there may be ice in the craters at the north and south poles. A colony on the Moon could use this as a source of oxygen with power provided by nuclear energy or solar panels. The Moon could also be a base for travel to the rest of the Solar System.\nMars is the obvious next target. It is half as far, again, as the Earth from the Sun and so receives half the warmth. It once had a magnetic field, but it decayed four billion years ago, leaving Mars with no protection from solar radiation. This stripped Mars of most of its atmosphere, leaving it with only one per cent of the pressure of Earth’s atmosphere.\nHowever, the pressure must have been higher in the past because we see what appear to be runoff channels and dried-up lakes. Liquid water cannot exist on Mars now, as it would vaporize in the near-vacuum. This suggests that Mars had a warm and wet period during which life might have appeared either spontaneously or through panspermia.\nThere is no sign of life on Mars now, but if we found evidence that life had once existed, it would indicate that the probability of life developing on a suitable planet was fairly high.\nNASA has sent a large number of spacecraft to Mars, starting with Mariner 4 in 1964. It has surveyed the planet with a number of orbiters, the latest being the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. These orbiters have revealed deep gullies and the highest mountains in the solar system.\nNASA has also landed a number of probes on the surface of Mars, most recently the two Mars Rovers. These have sent back pictures of a dry desert landscape.\nHowever, there is a large quantity of water in the form of ice in the polar regions. A colony on Mars could use this as a source of oxygen, at least.\nThere has been volcanic activity on Mars too. This would have brought minerals and metals to the surface which a colony could utilise.\nThe Moon and Mars are the most suitable sites for space colonies in the Solar System. Mercury and Venus are too hot, while Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants with no solid surface. The moons of Mars are very small and have no advantages over Mars itself.\nSome of the moons of Jupiter and Saturn might be possible. In particular, Titan, a moon of Saturn, is larger and more massive than other moons and has a dense atmosphere.\n\nDocument 9: Mars is blanketed by a thin, mostly carbon dioxide atmosphere -- one that is far too thin to keep water from freezing or quickly evaporating. However, geological evidence has led scientists to conclude that ancient Mars was once a warmer, wetter place than it is today. To produce a more temperate climate, several researchers have suggested that the planet was once shrouded in a much thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere. For decades that left the question, \"Where did all the carbon go?\"\nThe solar wind stripped away much of Mars' ancient atmosphere and is still removing tons of it every day. But scientists have been puzzled by why they haven't found more carbon -- in the form of carbonate -- captured into Martian rocks. They have also sought to explain the ratio of heavier and lighter carbons in the modern Martian atmosphere.\nNow a team of scientists from the California Institute of Technology and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, both in Pasadena, offer an explanation of the \"missing\" carbon, in a paper published today by the journal Nature Communications.\nThey suggest that 3.8 billion years ago, Mars might have had a moderately dense atmosphere. Such an atmosphere -- with a surface pressure equal to or less than that found on Earth -- could have evolved into the current thin one, not only minus the \"missing\" carbon problem, but also in a way consistent with the observed ratio of carbon-13 to carbon-12, which differ only by how many neutrons are in each nucleus.\n\"Our paper shows that transitioning from a moderately dense atmosphere to the current thin one is entirely possible,\" says Caltech postdoctoral fellow Renyu Hu, the lead author. \"It is exciting that what we know about the Martian atmosphere can now be pieced together into a consistent picture of its evolution -- and this does not require a massive undetected carbon reservoir.\"\nWhen considering how the early Martian atmosphere might have transitioned to its current state, there are two possible mechanisms for the removal of the excess carbon dioxide. Either the carbon dioxide was incorporated into minerals in rocks called carbonates or it was lost to space.\nAn August 2015 study used data from several Mars-orbiting spacecraft to inventory carbonates, showing there are nowhere near enough in the upper half mile (one kilometer) or the crust to contain the missing carbon from a thick early atmosphere during a time when networks of ancient river channels were active, about 3.8 billion years ago.\nThe escaped-to-space scenario has also been problematic.\n\nDocument 10: Did Mars become more habitable over time all thanks to the collisions it has endured from large space rocks like asteroids and comets?\nIn a study documented in the Earth and Planetary Science Letters, scientists reveal that these impacts may be some of the leading factors in why Mars has such a habitable temperature range and flowing water among other potential life-supporting features.\nThe scientists used 3D computer modelling to predict what happened to the planet and its living conditions during the times of these impacts.\nAlthough there are still no traces of complex life on Mars, or any other planet in our solar system for that matter, it is believed that the living conditions on Mars are constantly changing due to these impacts and the conditions there may be just right for life forms to begin emerging, just like they magically did here on Earth.\nThe remnants of flowing water found on Mars may be that of melted ice from a once-wet planet that has evaporated from the lack of a protective magnetic field against solar activity, and all of that water may have been brought there by way of space rocks.\nThe activity from these spatial bodies smacking the planet millions of years ago also would have warmed the planet up. This activity causes high amounts of energy deep within the planet’s crust, which has since cooled down significantly from the lack of recent impacts, which explains why the planet is so cold now.\nUnlike the Earth, which has tons of flowing water and a strong protective magnetic field, Mars is a barren desert wasteland with only small amount of verified flowing water. Regardless, its position in the solar system makes it a prime breeding ground for potential life.\nWhile modern rover and spacecraft equipment still has yet to find any life forms on the red planet, NASA eventually wants to send mankind to Mars so they can perform their own experimentations and search there without relying on robots to do it all.\nFurther sampling and mapping of the Martian environment may reveal interesting discoveries, especially below the planet’s surface where the Sun’s harmful rays don’t penetrate.\nSource: Cosmos Magazine,\n\nDocument 11: It may be time to call off the search for Mars' missing carbon.\nMars' carbon-rich atmosphere was once thick enough to raise the planet's surface temperature and allow entire oceans of liquid water to form there — a drastic change from the cold desert it is today. This metamorphosis of the Red Planet has put scientists on the hunt for a left-over \"carbon reservoir\" in the planet's dirt and soil. So far, the has come up empty.\nBut new research has concluded that \"a large 'missing' carbon reservoir is unnecessary\" to explain the planet's watery past, and that the Martian air wasn't exceptionally dense billions of years ago. . [Amazing Photos from Mars' Curiosity Rover]\nLike any planetary system, Mars' atmosphere is intimately linked with conditions on the planet's surface. The new work Learning just how thick the atmosphere was long ago, and how quickly it changed, could help answer questions about Mars' evolution, and as well as its potential for supporting life\nThe disappearing Martian atmosphere\nThere's no doubt that ancient Mars was different than the Red Planet seen today. Humanity seems to have missed a heyday in the Red Planet's history, when the surface was spotted with lakes and oceans, temperatures were warmer, and the atmosphere was thicker.\nThen again, the atmosphere would likely have consisted mostly of carbon dioxide, so it's not as though humans could have survived there unaided. But it's very possible that other forms of life found ancient Mars quite homey. (The very salty liquid water recently discovered on the surface of Mars suggests that the planet could still be hospitable to some life-forms.)\nWhere did Mars' thick atmosphere disappear to? Without a protective magnetic field around it, like Earth, Mars is exposed to the harsh environment of space. Energetic particles of light from the sun can chemically react with particles in the atmosphere and eject them from the planet. NASA's MAVEN orbiter recently showed that solar winds may have swept away a significant portion of Mars' atmosphere.\nFreed carbon atoms could also have been absorbed into the Martian dirt and soil, creating what are called \"carbonates\" — a sort of residue left over by the now-gone atmosphere.\nBut tests of the Martian soil show very low levels of carbonates — the \"carbon reservoir\" has not been found.\n\nDocument 12: Martian Greenhouse: Volcanic CO2 Doesn’t Cut It\nWith all the evidence for water on the surface of Mars in the distant past, we always return to the same question: how was it possible for water to be stable back then? These days any liquid water on the surface would boil due to the low pressure or freeze due to the low temperature (or maybe do both at the same time!).\nTo explain liquid water on the past, there has been a lot of work done to see whether a thicker atmosphere of CO2 could provide high enough pressure and temperature to allow stable water. Today Marc Hirschmann gave an interesting talk about whether volcanoes could give off enough gas to do the job.\nIt turns out that since the sun was dimmer in the past, and since Mars is farther from the sun than the Earth, the early CO2 atmosphere of mars would have to be several times as thick as Earth’s current atmosphere to keep liquid water stable at the surface. Hirscmann estimated how much volcanism there was on Mars based on the heat flow from the planet, and then calculated the amount of CO2 released based on the amount of carbon in the mantle. Hirschmann showed that on Mars, with the amount of oxygen available to react with rocks (the so-called “oxygen fugacity”), the carbon in many lavas would likely be in the form of graphite, or even diamonds deep in the mantle where the pressure is higher.\nWith reasonable estimates of the amount of volcanism and the amount of carbon in the lavas, Hirschmann estimated that even in the “best case” scenario, volcanism can only provide an atmosphere with 0.1 bars of CO2: only a tenth of Earth’s atmospheric pressure and not nearly enough to make Mars warm. This led Hirschmann to look at the possibility of CO2 from the formation and stabilization of the crust. Depending on the assumptions you make, this process can give either 10s of bars of CO2, or a negligible amount.\nHirschmann concluded that if crust formation was the source of a thick atmosphere, it would require the most extreme limits of likely conditions. Alternatively, a CO2 atmosphere could have somehow persisted from the very earliest period of martian evolution, when the planet had a “magma ocean”. Alternatively, there may have been a greenhouse effect caused by something other than CO2, such as SO2 or methane.\n\nQuestion: What evidence suggests that Mars once had more oxygen in its atmosphere than it does today?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Evidence suggests that Mars once had more oxygen in its atmosphere than it does today, primarily from the discovery of manganese-oxide minerals by NASA's Curiosity rover. These minerals require abundant water and strongly oxidizing conditions to form, indicating a higher oxygen level in Mars' early atmosphere. Additionally, research comparing Martian meteorites and rocks examined by the Spirit rover indicates that Mars had an oxygen-rich atmosphere 4 billion years ago, well before Earth's atmosphere became oxygen-rich. The presence of these manganese oxides and the geochemical differences observed in Martian samples point to a past Martian atmosphere with higher oxygen levels. This conclusion is supported by the formation of manganese-oxide minerals, which require oxidizing conditions, and the geochemical analysis of Martian samples indicating a higher oxygen content in the past.\n\nFurthermore, the isotopic abundances found in the martian atmosphere, such as nitrogen with weight 15 (15N) compared to nitrogen with weight 14 (14N), and the presence of heavy hydrogen (deuterium), suggest a unique atmospheric composition that is not like any other known source of gas. The discovery of high manganese deposits by the Opportunity rover in a region thousands of miles away from the Curiosity rover's findings supports the idea that environments required to form similar deposits could be found well beyond Gale Crater.\n\nThe size of the ripples found on Martian sand dunes could also be a record of the thinning of the atmosphere, suggesting that Mars had a thicker atmosphere in the past. The presence of manganese dioxide beneath the dusty surface of Mars, formed in the presence of water and atmospheric oxygen, further supports the theory that the planet must have harbored significant amounts of water and oxygen in the past.\n\nIn summary, the discovery of manganese-oxide minerals by the Curiosity rover and the geochemical analysis of Martian samples by the Spirit rover provide compelling evidence that Mars once had a more oxygen-rich atmosphere than it does today. These findings are crucial for understanding the planet's atmospheric evolution and its potential habitability in the past. The isotopic abundances and the size of the ripples on Martian sand dunes also contribute to the understanding of Mars' atmospheric history. The presence of manganese dioxide and the absence of carbonate minerals in the bedrock analyzed by Curiosity suggest that Mars' atmosphere when the lake existed -- about 3.5 billion years ago -- could not have held much carbon dioxide, further complicating the understanding of Mars' ancient atmosphere. These various lines of evidence collectively indicate that Mars once had a significantly different atmosphere, with higher levels of oxygen and a thicker atmosphere, compared to its current state."}

Most people in the West get enough protein from their daily diet especially if they eat meat, eggs and fish.\nThe daily recommendations are approximately 46 grams for women and 56 grams for men. Some groups of people might need more protein than others, for example pregnant and nursing women and people who are physically active, such as sports athletes and bodybuilders.\nSome of the best sources include meat, poultry, eggs, fish and dairy products. Red meat is high in saturated fat, but lean meats such as chicken and turkey are lower in fat and rich in protein. Seafood is a healthy protein source and contains Omega-3 essential fatty acids that are good for the heart. Cheese, yogurt and other dairy products are alternative sources of protein and they are also high in calcium. Vegetarian and vegan protein sources include beans, lentils, hemp powder, nuts, seeds, quinoa and soy products such as tofu and soy milk.\n\nDocument 2: How Much Protein Do You Need?\nProtein is having a moment. From Atkins to Paleo, it seems like everyone is eating a high protein diet. Even JetBlue is offering cricket-yes, cricket!-protein bars to airline passengers. Whether or not you eat a high-protein diet (or an insect snack mid-flight), chances are you're concerned about your intake of this important nutrient. Are you eating enough? Eating too much? Here's the skinny:\nAre You Getting Enough Protein?\n\"In a generally healthy diet, about 10 to 20 percent of your total calories should be coming from protein,\" says Alison Massey, MS, RD, Director of Diabetes Education at The Center for Endocrinology at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore.\nIndividuals with certain medical conditions or specific needs may need more or less protein, but, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, general recommendations for the average person in grams (g) per day are:\nMen ages 19 years and older: 56g\nWomen 19 years and older: 46g\nPregnant or nursing teenagers and women: 71g\nChildren ages 1-3 years: 13g\nChildren ages 4-7 years: 19g\nChildren ages 9-13 years: 34g\nBoys ages 14-18 years: 52g\nGirls ages 14-18 years: 46g\nWhile athletes may benefit from increased protein intake pre- and post-workout, the majority of us (even regular exercisers) are fine with the above guidelines.\nThe Problem With too Much Protein\nThe good news about protein intake is that most of us get enough-even those of us who follow a vegetarian or vegan diet. Plant-based proteins such as beans, nuts, and tofu help to create a balanced diet. The key word here being balanced, which brings us to the problem with high protein diets..\n\"When you eat a high protein diet and exclude carbohydrates-which is your body's main source of fuel-your body begins to burn its own fat for energy,\" explains Heidi McIndoo, MS, RD, author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to 200-300-400 Calorie Meals. \"While that may sound good, it actually leads to a condition called ketosis. Ketosis may help reduce your appetite, but it also increases your fluid loss, making any initial weight loss often just a loss of fluids.\"\n\nDocument 3: Roasting chickens are raised only for their meat and are generally young chickens between 8 and 12 weeks old, according to USDA. Usually roasted whole, these chickens have more meat per pound than a broiler-fryer type. Half a chicken includes half the breast, one drumstick, one thigh and one wing. If you're looking for a high protein source, roasted chicken is a healthy choice since all cuts are carbohydrate-free, contain no harmful trans fats or sugar and are naturally low in sodium. In addition, the USDA doesn't allow additives in fresh chicken.\nVideo of the Day\nDo you want to lose weight or be healthier?

It's a vital building block for muscle, hair, skin and cartilage. The yield from the meat of half a roasted chicken with skin — about 10 ounces or 285 grams — supplies 68 grams of protein. The recommended daily intake of protein for adult women is 46 grams; for men it's 56 grams, according to Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Eating half a chicken would supply all of your daily requirements for protein.\nRead More: Why Is Chicken Healthy to Eat?\nCalories in Half a Chicken\nIf you ate half a chicken, you would consume 636 calories. Dietary Guidelines estimates a daily intake ranging from 1,600 to 2,400 calories for adult women and 2,000 to 3,000 calories for adult men, depending on age and level of activity. To decrease the calories in half a chicken, remove the skin and you'll lower the calorie count to 476.\nDietary Fat and Cholesterol\nChicken contains 38 grams of total fat per half chicken. Of the lipid content, 15.4 grams are monounsaturated and 8.3 grams are polyunsaturated fat, which are important for helping your body absorb fat-soluble vitamins. Eating half a chicken would contribute 10.7 grams of saturated fat toward the recommended daily allowance of 10 percent of your total daily calories.\n\nDocument 4: How Much Protein Do You Need at Every Age?\nThe human body contains more than 600 muscles, each of which has a specific function. Some control actions such as swallowing, while others allow our skeleton to move effectively. When you eat protein, it helps to repair muscle and to maintain it, but it won’t make them bigger. This is controlled by the amount of exercise you do and its type, as well as your gender, age and your hormones. The amount of protein you need is dependent on your age, gender and weight.\nGenerally, protein should account for 15 to 25% of your daily energy intake and teenage girls and women aged 19 to 70 require about 46 g, while men and teenage boys need approximately 64 g. Older men and women aged 70 and above need more protein at 81 g and 57 g respectively. For women this amount is only higher if they are pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nDocument 5: How Much Protein Should a Female Take Post-Workout?\nProtein is an integral macronutrient for women looking to maximize performance and aid recovery from hard training.\nHow much protein you need after a training session is linked to how much protein you consume daily. According to the Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology, women need around 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight each day. This works out to 0.36 grams per pound. If you weigh 120 pounds, this means eating 43 grams per day. If you’re 150 pounds, then you should be eating 54 grams per day.\nStepping It Up\nThe “Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition” recommends eating a slightly higher protein intake, as this can improve adaptations to intense training. The Journal suggests that an intake closer to 1.4 to 2 grams per kilogram, or 0.64 to 0.91 grams per pound may be more suitable for both men and women. At this amount, a 120-pound female would require 77 to 109 grams per day, while a 150-pound female would need 96 to 137 grams. Splitting your daily protein evenly between all your meals is still a wise idea, even at a higher intake.\nThe type of training you do, as well as the overall diet style you’re following, also plays a role in how much protein you need. In an article for the FitnessRX for Women website, dietitian Susan M. Kleiner writes that women involved in endurance training need less total protein than those engaging in a strength workout. Dieting to lose body fat and eating a reduced number of calories also necessitates a higher protein intake to help preserve lean body mass.\nPutting It All Together\nTo work out your own individual post-workout protein needs, multiply your body weight in pounds by 0.6 if you’re an endurance athlete, or 0.8 if you’re a strength athlete to get your total daily protein intake, then divide this by the number of meals you eat each day. A 150-pound woman, for example, would need 90 grams of protein each day if endurance training or 120 grams if strength training. If you are eating five times per day, this would work out to 18 grams of protein at a post-endurance workout meal, or 24 grams post-strength training.\n\nDocument 6: Protein: How much do we need?\nThis post is part of Protein Angst, a series on the environmental and nutritional complexities of high-protein foods.

For a woman weighing 65 kg (143 pounds), this means a protein consumption of 52 g. Children, especially babies, need significantly more protein per kilogram of body weight. A maximum of 15 percent of the total calorie consumption should come from protein. About two-thirds of the protein should be vegetable-based and one third from animal sources.\nProtein Sources From Food\nIt’s usually not very difficult to get enough protein in your diet since it’s so abundant in many different types of foods. Vegetable protein sources include legumes such as peas, beans, and lentils as well as nuts, cereals, and potatoes. Protein-rich foods from animals are fish, meat, eggs, and dairy products such as cheese and yogurt.\nA vegan diet usually contains much less protein than a mixed diet. This is why children and teenagers as well as nursing mothers and pregnant women who wish to pursue a vegan diet need to make sure they’re getting enough protein since they need extra protein in general. With an adequate supply of protein, a dynamic balance between the development and degradation of protein occurs in adults. You might also need more protein during times of large blood loss or infections.\nDo Protein Supplements Make Sense?\nHave you ever bought protein-enriched food? What about high-protein dairy products, shakes, or protein bars, which can sometimes fill several grocery aisles? Do you think such foods make sense outside of competitive sports? Debate with family and friends on FamilyApp.\n\nDocument 8: red meat, chicken, fish, dairy) are referred to as ‘complete proteins’, meaning they contain all the essential amino acids your body requires.\nPlant-based proteins (e.g. tofu, legumes, nuts, seeds) on the other hand, are known as ‘incomplete proteins’ as they contain most, but not all of the essential amino acids. For example, beans lack the amino acid methionine yet are packed with lysine; while lysine is lacking in rice and wheat. Therefore, as long as you include a variety of plant-based protein sources in your diet, you can rest assured you will receive all the amino acids your body requires.\nAs long as you enjoy a healthy, balanced diet, you will have no problem meeting your nutritional needs for optimal health on a meat-free diet.\nHow much protein do you need?\nIn Australia, adults are advised to aim for between 0.8g – 1.2g of protein for each kilogram they weigh. To put this into perspective, a person weighing 70kg would be aiming for somewhere between 56 – 84g protein per day. This however, doesn’t require you to consume all of your protein needs in one meal. It’s best to spread protein intake throughout the day and aim for a good source at each meal.\nYour protein requirements will vary over your lifetime and depend on your individual circumstance. For example, a more active person, such as an athlete in training, will require more protein than someone living a sedentary lifestyle, so it’s important to adjust your protein intake accordingly.\nIf you don’t like the idea of counting your protein gram for gram, the other way to make sure you’re achieving adequate intake is to aim for around ¼ of your plate at breakfast, lunch and dinner to be made up of good quality proteins. Keep in mind, when selecting a ‘good’ quality protein, look for wholesome foods with no hidden nasties (e.g. high sodium, sugar, saturated or trans-fat).\n\nDocument 9: According to the USDA National Nutrient Database, a 3.5-ounce serving of roasted chicken breast meat contains approximately 31 grams of protein. A 3.5-ounce serving of roasted chicken leg meat contains approximately 27 grams of protein, and a 3.5-ounce serving of roasted chicken wing meat contains approximately 30 grams of protein.Continue Reading\nCompared to chicken leg meat and chicken wing meat, chicken breast is lowest in calories, total fat and saturated fat.

It is used to help develop and maintain almost every part of the body. It makes hormones and enzymes, while also helping keep your muscles, bones, blood, and hair and nails healthy.\nWe all need a different amount of protein based on our personal needs. For instance, individuals who exercise frequently should be consuming more protein, and your gender, age and body weight are also factors.[slideshow:91445]\n*Related: 8 Protein Supplements That Actually Work\nIt has been shown that consuming protein before exercise and within 30 minutes of finishing your workout will help with growth and recovery. “The guideline for protein consumption after exercise is 1 gram for every 3-4 grams of carbohydrate,” according to medicine.net.\nAccording to the USDA, the recommended consumption of protein for adults who are at an average activity and weight is 49g per day for women and 56g per day for men.\n\nDocument 11: The National Institutes of Health Food and Nutrition Board recommends that adults consume 0.83 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight (g/kg), or 0.37 grams per pound (g/lb), each day.

The value accepted for the safe level of intake is 0.83 g/kg per day, for proteins with a protein digestibility-corrected amino acid score value of 1.0. No safe upper limit has been identified... (p. 242)\n|Range||Body weight||Safe level of protein intake (score 1.0)|\n|From||40 kg||33 g per day|\n|To||80 kg||66 g per day|\nAmino Acid Requirements of Adults\n|Amino acid||mg/kg per day||mg/g protein|\n|Methionine + cysteine||15||22|\n|Phenylalanine + tyrosine||25||30|\nProtein Requirement Definition\nProtein requirement can be defined as: the lowest level of dietary protein intake that will balance the losses of nitrogen from the body, and thus maintain the body protein mass, in persons at energy balance with modest levels of physical activity, plus, in children or in pregnant or lactating women, the needs associated with the deposition of tissues or the secretion of milk at rates consistent with good health.\nTo satisfy the metabolic demand, the dietary protein must contain adequate and digestible amounts of nutritionally indispensable amino acids (histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine), and amino acids that can become indispensable under specific physiological or pathological conditions (conditionally indispensable: e.g. cysteine, tyrosine, taurine, glycine,arginine, glutamine and proline), plus sufficient total amino acid nitrogen, which can be supplied from any of the above amino acids, from dispensable amino acids (aspartic acid, asparagine, glutamic acid, alanine and serine) or from other sources of non-essential nitrogen.\nAt present, no method is entirely reliable for determining the dietary requirement for indispensable amino acids.\n\nDocument 13: The dilemma of promoting healthy ageing is complex, but research tells us that optimising protein intake at all meals is an important part of the process.\nWhat type of protein?\nResearch shows that age doesn’t affect how we digest and absorb protein foods.

Am J Med Dir Assoc. 2013;14(8):542-59\n\nQuestion: What are the recommended daily protein requirements for adult men and women?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "For adult women, the recommended daily protein intake is approximately 46 grams, while for adult men, it is around 56 grams. These recommendations are based on various sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and the National Institutes of Health Food and Nutrition Board. However, individual needs may vary depending on factors such as physical activity, age, and specific health conditions.\n\nPhysically active adults, athletes, and those over 50 may require higher protein intakes to support muscle health, recovery, and overall well-being. As individuals age, their protein requirements may increase due to factors such as reduced efficiency in protein utilization, increased muscle catabolism, and the need for higher protein intake to support muscle health and recovery. For instance, older adults may require 25% more protein than younger adults to maintain muscle mass and overall health.\n\nFor adults with certain health conditions, such as kidney disease or liver dysfunction, protein requirements may need to be adjusted based on individual needs and medical advice. High-quality protein sources, like lean meats, fish, eggs, and dairy products, are generally recommended for these individuals.\n\nIn addition to dietary protein, the timing and distribution of protein intake throughout the day can impact muscle protein synthesis and overall muscle health in older adults. Consuming protein with resistance exercise can enhance muscle protein synthesis, while ensuring adequate protein intake throughout the day can help maintain muscle mass and function.\n\nIn summary, age-related changes influence protein requirements in adults, often necessitating higher protein intakes to support muscle health and overall well-being. Individual needs may vary based on factors such as physical activity, health status, and specific age-related physiological changes. For adults with certain health conditions, protein requirements may need to be adjusted based on individual needs and medical advice."}
{"id": 38, "question": "At what age are dancers most vulnerable to injuries, and why?", "passages": [{"passage": "Constant training, without enough rest, puts stress on a body’s ability to adapt which can lead to fatigue, muscular weakness and frequent injuries—burnout. Burnout is a complex clinical condition with no single cause. Symptoms and signs vary from person to person, but tend to occur mainly in dancers whose daily schedules produce an imbalance between physical activity and time for recovery. Burnout can occur as a result of a few days or weeks of fatigue, by long-term exhaustion and by psychological stress.\nBurnout can affect both male and female dancers of all ages and levels of competence. Those most likely to reach the stage of burnout are usually the ones who set very high standards for themselves. Relative levels of physical fitness also relate to burnout—i.e. for the same workload, fit dancers are less likely to suffer than their unfit counterparts.\nWho is most vulnerable to burnout?\nWe know that adolescents are particularly vulnerable to injuries. Apart from periodic growth spurts that decrease muscle strength and flexibility, a teenager's musculoskeletal system is less resistant to repetitive loads during development. According to the 2003 Proceedings from the Annual Meeting of the International Association for Dance Medicine & Science (IADMS), students who work more than 8.5 hours a week at age 14 increase the risk of overuse injuries. The same is true for 15-year-old dancers who work more than 10 hours a week.\nWhen do I need to be careful?\nUnfortunately, the drive to exceed personal limits is ingrained in dancers of all ages, regardless of the toll. Tony Geeves’s research for the Safe Dance Project Report (Ausdance, 1990) found that 52% of dancers in Australia had chronic injury by age 18.\nIn a study conducted by the Harkness Center for Dance Injuries (UK), 79% of 500 injuries happened at the end of the day, occurring after five or more hours of work. 1 Safe Dance ll research reported that 28% of surveyed dancer’s incurred injuries within three weeks of returning to training after a holiday. 2\nFatigue is the number one indicator of burnout.

From Broadway stages to studios, a dancer’s body is in constant demand for hours a day, sometimes 7 days a week. While the role of a professional dancer can vary from teaching to performing, most dancers seem to have one major thing in common: injuries. Like any other sport, the physical demands of dance can sometimes result in occasional harm to the body. Dancers have found the practice of Yoga to be beneficial in supporting their physical bodies, but can Yoga be used as a form of injury management for these athletes?\nThere is evidence to suggest that Yoga may be beneficial for increasing and maintaining flexibility and balance amongst collegiate athletes, which serves as a form of injury prevention. The study analyzed a group of male college athletes who attended a bi-weekly Yoga class for 10 weeks (Polsgrove, Eggleston and Lockyer, 2016). The results showed that each participant experienced a significant increase in both flexibility and balance measurements and the researchers concluded that a regular Yoga practice “may enhance athletic performances that require these characteristics” (Polsgrove, Eggleston and Lockyer, 2016). However, more research is needed on Yoga as a form of injury management for dancers specifically. Additionally, the above study only analyzed male athletes and the results cannot be applied to other populations.\nLike most sports, there is an assumption of risk that comes with repetitive physical exercise. Local valley dance teacher, Rolanda Polanco, knows firsthand about movement related injuries. “I’ve broken toes, torn ligaments in my ankle and sprained both feet along with stress fractures, patellar tendonitis, back injuries and neck pain.” Rolanda has 18 years of experience teaching dance for children and high school students, who also experience their share of performance related injuries. “The most common injuries I have seen over the years amongst my students have been sprained ankles and stress fractures.”\nOn average, most dancers go through conditioning exercises and various forms of flexibility and strength training as methods of both injury prevention and improving performance. However, dance professionals do not always address injury treatment in the dance world. “Unfortunately in my experience, I had next to no injury management that came from my dance instructors & continued to repeatedly have the same injury,” says Hannah Swim, an actor and dancer of 11 years who also teaches Yoga.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:618275c3-e3c7-4408-8a53-2e3dc4dd987f>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Dance Injury Prevention Training\nAlso known as: injury prevention and training programs for dancers.\nWhat is dance injury prevention training?\nA training program designed to improve strength, range of motion, balance and neuromuscular control to\nenhance performance and reduce the risk of dance related injuries.\nWhat happens during the procedure?\nA Dance Medicine professional works with the dancer to improve muscular strength, range of motion, balance and neuromuscular control through specific exercise prescription.\nIs any special preparation needed?\nNo special preparation is needed for the training.

Join me in a five-part series as I discuss some important aspects of preventative care, including 1) warm-ups and cool downs 2) physical conditioning 3) adequate rest and recovery 4) footwear and floors, and 5) self-care and management.\n*As my current area of focus within the dance world is primarily partner dances, many of my examples will be based on this style of dance, but the themes I will be discussing are broadly applicable to other forms of dance.\nDo I really need to do a warm-up?\nHow many of us would head to the gym for a workout and immediately hit the treadmill in a full sprint without a warm-up? Yet, how many dancers have showed up to a social dance where the first song playing is so good that they just have to dance, regardless of how fast and energetic the song may be?\nProperly warming up your body before hitting the dance floor can reduce your risk of such injuries as, muscle strains, tendonitis, and overuse injuries. Every dance practice, performance, and social dance evening should begin with a warm-up to prepare your body for exercise, and end with a cool-down to kick-start your post-dance recovery.\nHow does a warm-up help?\nWarming up with light aerobic exercise not only improves performance, but may also reduce the risk of injury. Warm-ups lead to a number of physiological changes in your body that are necessary to prepare you mentally as well as physically, including:\n- increased rate and depth of breathing, which increases the intake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide\n- increased heart rate, which allows more oxygen and fuel to be delivered to working muscles\n- increased elasticity of muscles and tendons, which increases range of motion of joints and reduces risk of tearing\n- improved proprioception (joint position sense) which improves not only balance and stability, but also awareness of body position which can help with aesthetic aspect of your movements\n- improved signalling of nerves, which improves reaction time and your ability to generate a muscle contraction\nHow do I warm up?", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:819ad2d6-3159-46fb-b692-d3d0b8ab9a9a>::chunk-0"]}], "final_prompt": "You are an accurate and reliable AI assistant that can answer questions with the help of external documents.

Burnout is a complex clinical condition with no single cause. Symptoms and signs vary from person to person, but tend to occur mainly in dancers whose daily schedules produce an imbalance between physical activity and time for recovery. Burnout can occur as a result of a few days or weeks of fatigue, by long-term exhaustion and by psychological stress.\nBurnout can affect both male and female dancers of all ages and levels of competence. Those most likely to reach the stage of burnout are usually the ones who set very high standards for themselves. Relative levels of physical fitness also relate to burnout—i.e. for the same workload, fit dancers are less likely to suffer than their unfit counterparts.\nWho is most vulnerable to burnout?\nWe know that adolescents are particularly vulnerable to injuries. Apart from periodic growth spurts that decrease muscle strength and flexibility, a teenager's musculoskeletal system is less resistant to repetitive loads during development. According to the 2003 Proceedings from the Annual Meeting of the International Association for Dance Medicine & Science (IADMS), students who work more than 8.5 hours a week at age 14 increase the risk of overuse injuries. The same is true for 15-year-old dancers who work more than 10 hours a week.\nWhen do I need to be careful?\nUnfortunately, the drive to exceed personal limits is ingrained in dancers of all ages, regardless of the toll. Tony Geeves’s research for the Safe Dance Project Report (Ausdance, 1990) found that 52% of dancers in Australia had chronic injury by age 18.\nIn a study conducted by the Harkness Center for Dance Injuries (UK), 79% of 500 injuries happened at the end of the day, occurring after five or more hours of work. 1 Safe Dance ll research reported that 28% of surveyed dancer’s incurred injuries within three weeks of returning to training after a holiday. 2\nFatigue is the number one indicator of burnout. Dancers could learn from athletes who use periodisation (hard workouts are alternated with easier routines that have rest built into them) to prevent overload. Burned-out dancers need to let themselves do less without labelling themselves as ‘lazy’.\n\nDocument 5: The judging is fierce and the competition makes the dancer want to strive even harder to become an amazing artist.

When yellow and red flags are honored as soon as they pop up, there may still be time to make modifications and allow for some level of participation before having to withdraw from the activity altogether. From both the athlete and instructor/coach perspective, it is undesirable to have to sit out for one day. But this one day could prevent future sidelining that has the potential to last for multiple days or maybe the entire season.\nThere are many ways dancers can take accountability for nourishing and treating their body with care. Beyond finding a proper balance between activity and rest, dancers can integrate specific strengthening and flexibility exercises into their daily routine. Important muscle groups for dancers to strengthen include the deep core (including the transverses abdominus), gluteals and deep hip rotators, and foot intrinsic muscles. It is also important for dancers to remain flexible in their hip flexors, hamstrings, glutes, and ankle plantar flexors (gastrocnemius and soleus).\n\nDocument 8: What are the extremely negative side effects of being a ballet dancer?\n\nDocument 9: Questions and Answers\nHow old does my child need to be to start dance lessons?\nPreference is for children to start at age 5 and above. The age for entrance into classes or program varies from student and from class. This is based not only on age, but the student’s developmental level and skill\nHow do I know that my child is in the right class level?\nStudents should feel pushed in class but not overwhelmed. Most dancers will be in a class level for 2-3 years before moving to the next level. We are a small school so many classes are designed with that in mind.\nYou are a small school is my dancer receiving proper training?\nYes, because we are smaller we can focus on your child more than other places with large class sizes. This also allows us to make sure proper technique is being practiced. Our focus is on developing dancers that can perform their dance art cleanly, with ease and great skill.\nWho makes the final decision where the student is placed?\nOur teachers are well skilled to asses dancers ability and will make decisions about class placement.\nMay students start classes in the middle of the year?\nYes, students may enroll at any time; but preference is for the Fall in order to be ready to participate in the Spring recital.\nThis is my child’s first class, what do I need to purchase?\nWe offer shoes, tights, leotards and many other items for sale at the hall. Please see the teacher first for dress code info before making purchases.\nWe don’t have a lot of money to spend on dance attire?\nOur pricing for dance attire is very reasonably priced. We also offer shoes and leotards that can be borrowed or exchanged as your dancer grows.\nMy child has special needs or has an injury, can they take class?\nAll are welcome to take class. We will train and work with any student to develop the proper technique for their own body and needs. Many injures are from improper technique, over stretching and over use. Many times fixing these will result in dancers that are pain free.\n\nDocument 10: November 2000 https://www.iadms.org/page/1\n2) Delegete, A. Health Considerations for the Adolescent Dancer.

Dancers are exposed to physical stress from training, which increases susceptibility to illness. Additionally, working in close proximity with other dancers increases exposure to infection. Nutrition plays an important role in maintaining immune function to protect against infection. Learn how to boost your immunity by including these nutrients in your eating plan.\nProteins form many immune cells and transporters. Try to consume a variety of protein foods including seafood, lean meat, poultry, eggs, beans and peas, soy products and unsalted nuts and seeds.\nVitamin A helps regulate immune function and protects from infections by maintaining healthy tissues in skin, mouth, stomach, intestines and respiratory system. Vitamin A is found in foods such as sweet potatoes, carrots, kale, spinach, red bell peppers, apricots, eggs or foods labeled \"vitamin A fortified,\" such as cereal or dairy foods.\nVitamin E works as an antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Include vitamin E in your diet with fortified cereals, sunflower seeds, almonds, vegetable oils (such as sunflower or safflower oil), hazelnuts and peanut butter.\nVitamin C protects stimulates the formation of antibodies, which are necessary to fight infection.\n\nDocument 11: By Daniel Labadie\nThe life of an athlete is full of challenges, and dancers are no exception to this. From Broadway stages to studios, a dancer’s body is in constant demand for hours a day, sometimes 7 days a week. While the role of a professional dancer can vary from teaching to performing, most dancers seem to have one major thing in common: injuries. Like any other sport, the physical demands of dance can sometimes result in occasional harm to the body. Dancers have found the practice of Yoga to be beneficial in supporting their physical bodies, but can Yoga be used as a form of injury management for these athletes?\nThere is evidence to suggest that Yoga may be beneficial for increasing and maintaining flexibility and balance amongst collegiate athletes, which serves as a form of injury prevention. The study analyzed a group of male college athletes who attended a bi-weekly Yoga class for 10 weeks (Polsgrove, Eggleston and Lockyer, 2016). The results showed that each participant experienced a significant increase in both flexibility and balance measurements and the researchers concluded that a regular Yoga practice “may enhance athletic performances that require these characteristics” (Polsgrove, Eggleston and Lockyer, 2016). However, more research is needed on Yoga as a form of injury management for dancers specifically. Additionally, the above study only analyzed male athletes and the results cannot be applied to other populations.\nLike most sports, there is an assumption of risk that comes with repetitive physical exercise. Local valley dance teacher, Rolanda Polanco, knows firsthand about movement related injuries. “I’ve broken toes, torn ligaments in my ankle and sprained both feet along with stress fractures, patellar tendonitis, back injuries and neck pain.” Rolanda has 18 years of experience teaching dance for children and high school students, who also experience their share of performance related injuries. “The most common injuries I have seen over the years amongst my students have been sprained ankles and stress fractures.”\nOn average, most dancers go through conditioning exercises and various forms of flexibility and strength training as methods of both injury prevention and improving performance. However, dance professionals do not always address injury treatment in the dance world. “Unfortunately in my experience, I had next to no injury management that came from my dance instructors & continued to repeatedly have the same injury,” says Hannah Swim, an actor and dancer of 11 years who also teaches Yoga.\n\nDocument 12: Dance Injury Prevention Training\nAlso known as: injury prevention and training programs for dancers.\nWhat is dance injury prevention training?\nA training program designed to improve strength, range of motion, balance and neuromuscular control to\nenhance performance and reduce the risk of dance related injuries.\nWhat happens during the procedure?\nA Dance Medicine professional works with the dancer to improve muscular strength, range of motion, balance and neuromuscular control through specific exercise prescription.\nIs any special preparation needed?\nNo special preparation is needed for the training. The dancer should wear dance attire.\nWhat are the risk factors?\nThere is still a potential risk of injury occurring even after a patient has undergone dance injury prevention training.\nReviewed by: Lauren Butler, PT, DPT, SCS\nThis page was last updated on: 8/7/2018 10:48:17 AM\nFrom the Newsdesk\nAn Athletic Trainer (ATC) is a licensed healthcare provider responsible for injury prevention, emergency care, clinical diagnosis, therapeutic intervention and rehabilitation of injuries as well as medical conditions.\n\nDocument 13: Some people say that a dancers feet is the most uglyest part of the body. They say this because a dancers feet is one of the\nmost important part of the body to a dancer. It is were all the dancing really begins. The feet allow the dancer to move about\nfreely when needed to. They are the most abused part of the body when doing ballet. Great strength is used with the arch so\nthere is alot of pointing involved. Before a dancer may even go on pointe they must have to get calluses to protect themselves\nfrom from pointe.\nNot only do ballet dancers get calluses but when they were pointe shoes they intend have worked there feet so much that the\nskin that rubs against the shoe is raw. Not only that but endure crooked toes for the pounding and strain involved.This is\nwhy dancers do many things to there feet and shoes to make it more comfortable for wear. No matter what they use to make it\nbetter they can still feel the pain when dancing on pointe Even though ballet is very beautiful it can turn out bad at an\nolder age, from all the technique the hip becomes and injury from it. In all is ballet worth it all?\n\nDocument 14: As a dance teacher and physiotherapist, something my students have often asked me is, “what can I do to avoid getting injured while dancing?” Although dance isn’t often considered a “sport” in the traditional sense, many genres of dance are highly athletic, and just like athletes, dancers are at risk of “sports” injuries. Join me in a five-part series as I discuss some important aspects of preventative care, including 1) warm-ups and cool downs 2) physical conditioning 3) adequate rest and recovery 4) footwear and floors, and 5) self-care and management.\n*As my current area of focus within the dance world is primarily partner dances, many of my examples will be based on this style of dance, but the themes I will be discussing are broadly applicable to other forms of dance.\nDo I really need to do a warm-up?\nHow many of us would head to the gym for a workout and immediately hit the treadmill in a full sprint without a warm-up? Yet, how many dancers have showed up to a social dance where the first song playing is so good that they just have to dance, regardless of how fast and energetic the song may be?\nProperly warming up your body before hitting the dance floor can reduce your risk of such injuries as, muscle strains, tendonitis, and overuse injuries. Every dance practice, performance, and social dance evening should begin with a warm-up to prepare your body for exercise, and end with a cool-down to kick-start your post-dance recovery.\nHow does a warm-up help?\nWarming up with light aerobic exercise not only improves performance, but may also reduce the risk of injury. Warm-ups lead to a number of physiological changes in your body that are necessary to prepare you mentally as well as physically, including:\n- increased rate and depth of breathing, which increases the intake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide\n- increased heart rate, which allows more oxygen and fuel to be delivered to working muscles\n- increased elasticity of muscles and tendons, which increases range of motion of joints and reduces risk of tearing\n- improved proprioception (joint position sense) which improves not only balance and stability, but also awareness of body position which can help with aesthetic aspect of your movements\n- improved signalling of nerves, which improves reaction time and your ability to generate a muscle contraction\nHow do I warm up?\n\nQuestion: At what age are dancers most vulnerable to injuries, and why?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Dancers are most vulnerable to injuries during adolescence, particularly around the ages of 14 to 16. This vulnerability is due to several factors, including growth spurts that can temporarily decrease muscle strength and flexibility, and the fact that the musculoskeletal system is less resistant to repetitive loads during development. Adolescents are also more likely to push themselves beyond their limits, increasing the risk of overuse injuries. Research has shown that students who work more than 8.5 hours a week at age 14 and 15-year-old dancers who work more than 10 hours a week are at increased risk of overuse injuries.\n\nFurthermore, the constant repetition of strenuous movements during this developmental stage can cause instability in hip sockets and lead to severe pain in the joints, as well as long-term conditions like deformities, dysplasia, and labral tears.\n\nIn summary, the combination of growth-related changes, increased physical demands, and psychological pressures makes adolescent dancers particularly vulnerable to injuries."}
{"id": 39, "question": "What happens during viral interference between two viruses?", "passages": [{"passage": "Mutual exclusion occurs when a host cell is simultaneously infected with two competing viruses, but only one virus goes on to replicate itself. This phenomenon was originally described in bacteriophages by Delbrück in 1945. Mutual exclusion implies that the virus particle which infects first alters the host cell in such a way that a second infection is unlikely. Subsequent studies found that mutual exclusion not only occurs between different viruses but also with nearly identical viruses, presumably as a way to avoid “super-infection” (Dulbecco, R. 1952 Mutual exclusion between related phages. J Bacteriol 63, 209-217). While the virus that wins the race prevents infection by additional viruses, the excluded viruses may interfere with its replication, which is referred to as a “depressor effect” (Delbrück M. 1945 Interference Between Bacterial Viruses: III. The Mutual Exclusion Effect and the Depressor Effect. J Bacteriol. 50(2): 151-170). There are different mechanisms underlying mutual exclusion and depression among bacteriophages, and still, not all of them are understood.\nIn some instances, exclusion causes the out-competed virus to be rapidly degraded. For example, with bacteriophage T3, degradation occurs after adsorption of the primary infecting phage but before the virus genome is expressed. There is indirect evidence with phage λ that host membrane depolarization is triggered by the successful infecting particle, which initiates exclusion.\nMutual exclusion not only occurs among bacteriophages but also in viruses infecting certain unicellular, eukaryotic chlorella-like green algae (the chlorella viruses). Plaques arising from single cells simultaneously inoculated with two different chlorella viruses usually only contain one of the two viruses. Previously, the mechanism underlying chlorella virus mutual exclusion is unknown. Chlorella viruses often encode DNA restriction endonucleases and it was originally suggested that one function of the DNA restriction endonucleases might be to exclude infection by other viruses. A new study indicates that chlorella viruses prevent multiple infections by depolarizing the host cell membrane (Chlorella Viruses Prevent Multiple Infections by Depolarizing the Host Membrane.

The integrated virus is thought to be transcribed along with the other intronic regions of the cellular gene, but is then merely spliced out. This mechanism has been confirmed in J-Lat cells, a CD4+ T-cell line used as a model for HIV-1 postintegration latency . Lenasi and colleagues have shown that transcriptional interference could be reversed by inhibiting the upstream transcription or by cooperatively activating viral transcription initiation and elongation. Of note, certain host transcription factors and/or viral activators, which bind strongly to their cognate sites, could resist the passage of \"read-through\" RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) . As studies in yeast have demonstrated that the elongating polymerase is followed by a rapid refolding of histones in a closed configuration to counteract transcription initiation at cryptic sites in the transcription unit , chromatin structure and epigenetic events could also be implicated in transcriptional interference. Conversely, Han et al.  have demonstrated that upstream transcription could enhance HIV-1 gene expression without significant modification of the chromatin status in the region when the provirus is integrated in the same orientation as the host gene. These partially contradictory studies have been questioned  based on earlier studies that reported transcriptional interference as important in repressing viral promoters integrated in the same orientation as an upstream host gene promoter [60, 65, 66]. Interestingly, Marcello and colleagues  have recently reported that an integrated provirus suffering from transcriptional interference in basal conditions becomes transcriptionally active following Tat expression; and that this provirus can switch off the transcription of the host gene within which it has integrated or can allow the coexistence of expression of both host and viral genes. Further analysis of the mechanisms exploited by host genes to regulate a viral promoter inserted in their transcriptional unit or by the virus to counterbalance the host gene control will be needed to completely elucidate these transcriptional interference events.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:20fcd32b-ecaf-4298-9435-e031d6d32eb6>::chunk-5"]}, {"passage": "Yep, I looked more closely and the substrate species is infected correctly most of the time, and this is the species that eventually takes over the substrate.

Proteins in the third layer (VP7 and the VP4 spike) disrupt the membrane of the endosome, creating a difference in the calcium concentration, this causes the breakdown of VP7 trimers into single protein subunits, leaving the VP2 and VP6 protein coats around the viral dsRNA, forming a double-layered particle (DLP).\nThe eleven dsRNA strands remain within the protection of the two protein shells and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase creates mRNA transcripts of the double-stranded viral genome. By remaining in the core, the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses including RNA interference that are triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA.\nDuring the infection, rotavirus produces mRNA for both protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled; in the viroplasm the positive sense viral RNAs that are used as templates for the synthesis of viral genomic dsRNA are protected from siRNA-induced RNase degradation. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus as early as two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought to be made by two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference in vitro results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication, the DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.\nRotavirus is transmitted by the fæcal-oral route, via contact with contaminated hands, surfaces and objects, and possibly by the respiratory route. Viral diarrhoea is highly contagious, the faeces of an infected person can contain more than 10 trillion infectious particles per gram; fewer than 100 of these are required to transmit infection to another person.\nRotaviruses are stable in the environment and have been found in estuary samples at levels up to 1–5 infectious particles per US gallon, the viruses survive between 9 and 19 days.

For the first time, researchers at the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford have witnessed virus-induced “frameshifting” in action and have been able to identify the crucial role of particular elements.\nThe scientists have revealed the workings of the process known as ‘ribosomal frameshifting’ that forces a mis-reading of the genetic code during protein synthesis. The correct expression of most genes depends upon accurate translation of the ‘frame’ of the genetic code, which has a three nucleotide periodicity. Viruses such as HIV and SARS bring into the cell a special signal that forces the ribosome to back up by one nucleotide, pushing it into another ‘frame’ and allowing synthesis of different viral proteins. These are exploited by viruses and help them to survive and multiply, according to background information in the article.\nThe British researchers successfully imaged frameshifting in action and for the first time observed how a virus encoded element called an RNA pseudoknot interferes with the translation of the genetic code to allow viruses like HIV and SARS to express their own enzymes of replication.\nDr Ian Brierley, the project leader at the University of Cambridge, said: “The images we obtained give us an insight into how a virus-encoded RNA pseudoknot can induce frameshifting and may be useful in designing new ways to combat virus pathogens that use this process.” Professor Julia Goodfellow, Chief Executive of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council said: “The work to explore fundamental biology today is laying the foundation for potential medical applications over the next twenty years.”\nMEDICA.de; Source: Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:83969bd4-72dc-41a3-85f2-b73d058959be>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Protein–Protein Interactions in Virus–Host Systems\n- Department of Life Sciences, Centre for Integrative Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom\nTo study virus–host protein interactions, knowledge about viral and host protein architectures and repertoires, their particular evolutionary mechanisms, and information on relevant sources of biological data is essential. The purpose of this review article is to provide a thorough overview about these aspects. Protein domains are basic units defining protein interactions, and the uniqueness of viral domain repertoires, their mode of evolution, and their roles during viral infection make viruses interesting models of study. Mutations at protein interfaces can reduce or increase their binding affinities by changing protein electrostatics and structural properties. During the course of a viral infection, both pathogen and cellular proteins are constantly competing for binding partners. Endogenous interfaces mediating intraspecific interactions—viral–viral or host–host interactions—are constantly targeted and inhibited by exogenous interfaces mediating viral–host interactions. From a biomedical perspective, blocking such interactions is the main mechanism underlying antiviral therapies. Some proteins are able to bind multiple partners, and their modes of interaction define how fast these “hub proteins” evolve. “Party hubs” have multiple interfaces; they establish simultaneous/stable (domain–domain) interactions, and tend to evolve slowly. On the other hand, “date hubs” have few interfaces; they establish transient/weak (domain–motif) interactions by means of short linear peptides (15 or fewer residues), and can evolve faster. Viral infections are mediated by several protein–protein interactions (PPIs), which can be represented as networks (protein interaction networks, PINs), with proteins being depicted as nodes, and their interactions as edges. It has been suggested that viral proteins tend to establish interactions with more central and highly connected host proteins. In an evolutionary arms race, viral and host proteins are constantly changing their interface residues, either to evade or to optimize their binding capabilities. Apart from gaining and losing interactions via rewiring mechanisms, virus–host PINs also evolve via gene duplication (paralogy); conservation (orthology); horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (xenology); and molecular mimicry (convergence).

Some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, Sendai virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, appear to be capable of direct fusion at the plasma membrane after initial attachment –. However, the majority of enveloped viruses use endocytosis for uptake and transport prior to fusion. Since endocytic cargo may eventually end up in the destructive environment of the lysosome, environmental cues are crucial to trigger viral fusion at the right stage of trafficking. These triggers, which may include a decrease in pH, changes in redox environment, and proteolytic activity –, induce conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins leading to the merger of viral and host membranes. Two well-studied viruses; influenza A virus (IAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), are known to undergo fusion upon exposure to low pH –. Other enveloped viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Ebola virus, require proteolytic processing of their viral fusion proteins in the endosomal system for fusion to occur –.\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales.

Cells were then incubated at 37°C for two days, at which time the extent of infection was gauged by luciferase assay. We added blocking reagents targeting a range of HCV cell entry factors at various times before or after the binding phase. If a given entry factor had already been utilized by the virus, then the blocking reagent would be ineffective, thus indicting the point in the entry process that the entry factor is required.\nUsing this assay we found that both HCVpp and HCVcc exhibit similar entry factor usage patterns in HepG2 cells (Figure 6A and B). For both viruses, an E2 antibody , an SR-BI antibody , and heparin, which blocks virion association with GAGs, mainly inhibited host cell binding, as the majority of their blocking activity was lost at zero minutes post temperature shift. The remaining antibodies targeting CD81, CLDN1 , and OCLN all continued to strongly inhibit infection when added after the binding phase, indicating these factors are post-binding HCV cell entry factors. Furthermore, the kinetics of loss of inhibition with antibodies to CD81, CLDN1, and OCLN suggests that these entry factors are used in this order by the incoming particle. This finding is most easily illustrated by focusing on the 60 minute time point (Figure 6A and B, highlighted with dotted line brackets), when CD81 antibody inhibition is nearly completely lost, CLDN1 antibody inhibition is reduced by approximately half, and OCLN directed FLAG antibody still retains most of its blocking potential.

Endocytic uptake is also required for a mutant virus carrying a S protein with a FCS immediately upstream of its FP, despite the relative insensitivity to high concentrations of BafA1. Therefore, the ability of a virus to infect cells in the presence of BafA1 does not necessarily imply virus entry to occur at the cell surface.

The ability of MHV to cause cell-cell fusion at neutral pH while requiring endocytic uptake for virus-cell fusion suggests different requirements and triggers for these two fusion processes. Similarly, RSV was recently shown to enter cells after endocytic uptake despite the ability of this virus to cause cell-cell fusion .\nThe present study confirms and extends previous publications on MHV entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis , . Both siRNAs downregulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis-associated proteins, such as clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) and Dynamin 2 (DNM2), and agents affecting this uptake pathway (Chlopro, Dynasore, Dyngo-4a) were capable of inhibiting infection with MHV. Importantly, these findings could be confirmed in our novel replication-independent virus-cell fusion assay, thereby directly showing an involvement of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in entry of MHV. Analysis of several accessory factors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis showed that clathrin-mediated entry of MHV strain A59 depends on clathrin-adaptor DAB2, but not on EPS15 or AAK1. Previously, clathrin-mediated entry of MHV strain 2 was also shown to be independent of EPS15 .", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:5434ee51-ac62-4869-84b3-33a3a1412778>::chunk-26"]}], "final_prompt": "You are an accurate and reliable AI assistant that can answer questions with the help of external documents.

This phenomenon was originally described in bacteriophages by Delbrück in 1945. Mutual exclusion implies that the virus particle which infects first alters the host cell in such a way that a second infection is unlikely. Subsequent studies found that mutual exclusion not only occurs between different viruses but also with nearly identical viruses, presumably as a way to avoid “super-infection” (Dulbecco, R. 1952 Mutual exclusion between related phages. J Bacteriol 63, 209-217). While the virus that wins the race prevents infection by additional viruses, the excluded viruses may interfere with its replication, which is referred to as a “depressor effect” (Delbrück M. 1945 Interference Between Bacterial Viruses: III. The Mutual Exclusion Effect and the Depressor Effect. J Bacteriol. 50(2): 151-170). There are different mechanisms underlying mutual exclusion and depression among bacteriophages, and still, not all of them are understood.\nIn some instances, exclusion causes the out-competed virus to be rapidly degraded. For example, with bacteriophage T3, degradation occurs after adsorption of the primary infecting phage but before the virus genome is expressed. There is indirect evidence with phage λ that host membrane depolarization is triggered by the successful infecting particle, which initiates exclusion.\nMutual exclusion not only occurs among bacteriophages but also in viruses infecting certain unicellular, eukaryotic chlorella-like green algae (the chlorella viruses). Plaques arising from single cells simultaneously inoculated with two different chlorella viruses usually only contain one of the two viruses. Previously, the mechanism underlying chlorella virus mutual exclusion is unknown. Chlorella viruses often encode DNA restriction endonucleases and it was originally suggested that one function of the DNA restriction endonucleases might be to exclude infection by other viruses. A new study indicates that chlorella viruses prevent multiple infections by depolarizing the host cell membrane (Chlorella Viruses Prevent Multiple Infections by Depolarizing the Host Membrane.

The integrated virus is thought to be transcribed along with the other intronic regions of the cellular gene, but is then merely spliced out. This mechanism has been confirmed in J-Lat cells, a CD4+ T-cell line used as a model for HIV-1 postintegration latency . Lenasi and colleagues have shown that transcriptional interference could be reversed by inhibiting the upstream transcription or by cooperatively activating viral transcription initiation and elongation. Of note, certain host transcription factors and/or viral activators, which bind strongly to their cognate sites, could resist the passage of \"read-through\" RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) . As studies in yeast have demonstrated that the elongating polymerase is followed by a rapid refolding of histones in a closed configuration to counteract transcription initiation at cryptic sites in the transcription unit , chromatin structure and epigenetic events could also be implicated in transcriptional interference. Conversely, Han et al.  have demonstrated that upstream transcription could enhance HIV-1 gene expression without significant modification of the chromatin status in the region when the provirus is integrated in the same orientation as the host gene. These partially contradictory studies have been questioned  based on earlier studies that reported transcriptional interference as important in repressing viral promoters integrated in the same orientation as an upstream host gene promoter [60, 65, 66]. Interestingly, Marcello and colleagues  have recently reported that an integrated provirus suffering from transcriptional interference in basal conditions becomes transcriptionally active following Tat expression; and that this provirus can switch off the transcription of the host gene within which it has integrated or can allow the coexistence of expression of both host and viral genes. Further analysis of the mechanisms exploited by host genes to regulate a viral promoter inserted in their transcriptional unit or by the virus to counterbalance the host gene control will be needed to completely elucidate these transcriptional interference events.\n\nDocument 4: Yep, I looked more closely and the substrate species is infected correctly most of the time, and this is the species that eventually takes over the substrate. But with two viruses and a variety of initial cell splits, the substrate looks pretty wild and crazy early on in the infection process.\nI don't think theirs anything that special about the modes I used: it's primarily the relationship between the modes and how they copy over. Perhaps you can glean some hints from my previous post.\nPost your own challenge to your fellow researchers!\n\nDocument 5: The virus enter cells by receptor mediated endocytosis and form a vesicle known as an endosome. Proteins in the third layer (VP7 and the VP4 spike) disrupt the membrane of the endosome, creating a difference in the calcium concentration, this causes the breakdown of VP7 trimers into single protein subunits, leaving the VP2 and VP6 protein coats around the viral dsRNA, forming a double-layered particle (DLP).\nThe eleven dsRNA strands remain within the protection of the two protein shells and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase creates mRNA transcripts of the double-stranded viral genome. By remaining in the core, the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses including RNA interference that are triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA.\nDuring the infection, rotavirus produces mRNA for both protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled; in the viroplasm the positive sense viral RNAs that are used as templates for the synthesis of viral genomic dsRNA are protected from siRNA-induced RNase degradation. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus as early as two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought to be made by two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference in vitro results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication, the DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.\nRotavirus is transmitted by the fæcal-oral route, via contact with contaminated hands, surfaces and objects, and possibly by the respiratory route. Viral diarrhoea is highly contagious, the faeces of an infected person can contain more than 10 trillion infectious particles per gram; fewer than 100 of these are required to transmit infection to another person.\nRotaviruses are stable in the environment and have been found in estuary samples at levels up to 1–5 infectious particles per US gallon, the viruses survive between 9 and 19 days. Sanitary measures adequate for eliminating bacteria and parasites seem to be ineffective in control of rotavirus, as the incidence of rotavirus infection in countries with high and low health standards is similar.\n\nDocument 6: The effect of an infectious agent on health and disease is likely influenced by its diverse interactions with other infectious agents claiming the same host or host cell. In other words, disease potential is dependent on interactions between numerous different pathogens and the host’s defense mechanisms. Understanding these interactions may help to better predict the outcome of disease, improve treatment, and identify novel therapeutic strategies. The Experimental Virology group investigates general concepts, molecular pathways, and implications of virus-virus interactions in the co-infected host, using the complex and competitive relationship between adeno-associated virus (AAV) and its helper viruses as a model. The knowledge gained from these studies can be applied also to investigate more complex biosocial processes of disease, for example on the level of an infected host, thereby forming a strong link between the Experimental Virology and the Molecular and Clinical Veterinary Virology groups.\nThe Experimental Virology group engages also in the development and use of viruses for applications in Gene Therapy and Vaccination.\nCover Illustration: Electronmicrograph of herpesvirus particles\n\nDocument 7: Viruses are able to interfere with the host cell processes that our bodies use to replicate cells, and protein synthesis is often one of their targets. For the first time, researchers at the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford have witnessed virus-induced “frameshifting” in action and have been able to identify the crucial role of particular elements.\nThe scientists have revealed the workings of the process known as ‘ribosomal frameshifting’ that forces a mis-reading of the genetic code during protein synthesis. The correct expression of most genes depends upon accurate translation of the ‘frame’ of the genetic code, which has a three nucleotide periodicity. Viruses such as HIV and SARS bring into the cell a special signal that forces the ribosome to back up by one nucleotide, pushing it into another ‘frame’ and allowing synthesis of different viral proteins. These are exploited by viruses and help them to survive and multiply, according to background information in the article.\nThe British researchers successfully imaged frameshifting in action and for the first time observed how a virus encoded element called an RNA pseudoknot interferes with the translation of the genetic code to allow viruses like HIV and SARS to express their own enzymes of replication.\nDr Ian Brierley, the project leader at the University of Cambridge, said: “The images we obtained give us an insight into how a virus-encoded RNA pseudoknot can induce frameshifting and may be useful in designing new ways to combat virus pathogens that use this process.” Professor Julia Goodfellow, Chief Executive of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council said: “The work to explore fundamental biology today is laying the foundation for potential medical applications over the next twenty years.”\nMEDICA.de; Source: Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC)\n\nDocument 8: Protein–Protein Interactions in Virus–Host Systems\n- Department of Life Sciences, Centre for Integrative Systems Biology and Bioinformatics, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom\nTo study virus–host protein interactions, knowledge about viral and host protein architectures and repertoires, their particular evolutionary mechanisms, and information on relevant sources of biological data is essential. The purpose of this review article is to provide a thorough overview about these aspects. Protein domains are basic units defining protein interactions, and the uniqueness of viral domain repertoires, their mode of evolution, and their roles during viral infection make viruses interesting models of study. Mutations at protein interfaces can reduce or increase their binding affinities by changing protein electrostatics and structural properties. During the course of a viral infection, both pathogen and cellular proteins are constantly competing for binding partners. Endogenous interfaces mediating intraspecific interactions—viral–viral or host–host interactions—are constantly targeted and inhibited by exogenous interfaces mediating viral–host interactions. From a biomedical perspective, blocking such interactions is the main mechanism underlying antiviral therapies. Some proteins are able to bind multiple partners, and their modes of interaction define how fast these “hub proteins” evolve. “Party hubs” have multiple interfaces; they establish simultaneous/stable (domain–domain) interactions, and tend to evolve slowly. On the other hand, “date hubs” have few interfaces; they establish transient/weak (domain–motif) interactions by means of short linear peptides (15 or fewer residues), and can evolve faster. Viral infections are mediated by several protein–protein interactions (PPIs), which can be represented as networks (protein interaction networks, PINs), with proteins being depicted as nodes, and their interactions as edges. It has been suggested that viral proteins tend to establish interactions with more central and highly connected host proteins. In an evolutionary arms race, viral and host proteins are constantly changing their interface residues, either to evade or to optimize their binding capabilities. Apart from gaining and losing interactions via rewiring mechanisms, virus–host PINs also evolve via gene duplication (paralogy); conservation (orthology); horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (xenology); and molecular mimicry (convergence). The last sections of this review focus on PPI experimental approaches and their limitations, and provide an overview of sources of biomolecular data for studying virus–host protein interactions.\n\nDocument 9: When these viral proteins bind to receptors on the surface of neighboring cells, cell–cell fusion takes place, leading to syncytia formation . Since the virus is occupying cellular factors that are otherwise utilized by the cell, its replication can alter the host cell´s primary features or even destroy it.\n\nDocument 10: Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nTo achieve successful infection enveloped viruses need to fuse with a host cell membrane to deliver the viral genome into the host cell. Some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, Sendai virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, appear to be capable of direct fusion at the plasma membrane after initial attachment –. However, the majority of enveloped viruses use endocytosis for uptake and transport prior to fusion. Since endocytic cargo may eventually end up in the destructive environment of the lysosome, environmental cues are crucial to trigger viral fusion at the right stage of trafficking. These triggers, which may include a decrease in pH, changes in redox environment, and proteolytic activity –, induce conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins leading to the merger of viral and host membranes. Two well-studied viruses; influenza A virus (IAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), are known to undergo fusion upon exposure to low pH –. Other enveloped viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Ebola virus, require proteolytic processing of their viral fusion proteins in the endosomal system for fusion to occur –.\nCoronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, plus-strand RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. They are capable of infecting a wide variety of mammalian and avian species. In most cases they cause respiratory and/or intestinal tract disease. Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are known as major causes of the common cold (e.g. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43). However, the emergence of new HCoVs of zoonotic origin has shown the potential of CoVs to cause life-threatening disease in humans as was demonstrated during the 2002/2003 SARS-CoV epidemics and more recently for MERS-CoV in the Middle East , . The well-studied mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is often used as a safe model to study CoV infections.\nAll CoV virions contain a canonical set of four structural proteins.\n\nDocument 11: Unbound virus was then removed by washing with cold buffer, and we shifted the temperature by adding media prewarmed to 37°C to allow post-binding entry events, such as translocation across membranes, endocytosis, and fusion. Cells were then incubated at 37°C for two days, at which time the extent of infection was gauged by luciferase assay. We added blocking reagents targeting a range of HCV cell entry factors at various times before or after the binding phase. If a given entry factor had already been utilized by the virus, then the blocking reagent would be ineffective, thus indicting the point in the entry process that the entry factor is required.\nUsing this assay we found that both HCVpp and HCVcc exhibit similar entry factor usage patterns in HepG2 cells (Figure 6A and B). For both viruses, an E2 antibody , an SR-BI antibody , and heparin, which blocks virion association with GAGs, mainly inhibited host cell binding, as the majority of their blocking activity was lost at zero minutes post temperature shift. The remaining antibodies targeting CD81, CLDN1 , and OCLN all continued to strongly inhibit infection when added after the binding phase, indicating these factors are post-binding HCV cell entry factors. Furthermore, the kinetics of loss of inhibition with antibodies to CD81, CLDN1, and OCLN suggests that these entry factors are used in this order by the incoming particle. This finding is most easily illustrated by focusing on the 60 minute time point (Figure 6A and B, highlighted with dotted line brackets), when CD81 antibody inhibition is nearly completely lost, CLDN1 antibody inhibition is reduced by approximately half, and OCLN directed FLAG antibody still retains most of its blocking potential. Fusion within a low pH endosome, probed in parallel by adding bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of vacuolar proton-ATPases that impairs intracellular vesicle acidification, took place even later in the entry process than usage of the tested cell entry factors. To assist in directly comparing the kinetics of action of each inhibitor that acted at a post-binding step, we plotted these data as percent inhibition relative to the observed maximum and minimum inhibitory activities of each agent (Figure 6D+E).\n\nDocument 12: Also the use of recombinant viruses differing only in their spike proteins enabled us to show that inhibition of virus infection upon siRNA transfection resulted from differences in virus entry and not virus replication. Finally, the results obtained were corroborated by using a large panel of inhibitors and by making use of haploid knockout cells, in which late endosome-to-lysosome trafficking was inhibited.\nOur results demonstrate that MHV requires endocytic uptake for virus entry despite the S protein's ability to induce cell-cell fusion at neutral pH. Endocytic uptake is also required for a mutant virus carrying a S protein with a FCS immediately upstream of its FP, despite the relative insensitivity to high concentrations of BafA1. Therefore, the ability of a virus to infect cells in the presence of BafA1 does not necessarily imply virus entry to occur at the cell surface. Also a recombinant MHV carrying the spike protein of MHV-4 (MHV-JHM) was found to enter via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (MHV-S4; Figure S10 in Text S1) despite its ability to cause extensive cell-cell fusion –. The ability of MHV to cause cell-cell fusion at neutral pH while requiring endocytic uptake for virus-cell fusion suggests different requirements and triggers for these two fusion processes. Similarly, RSV was recently shown to enter cells after endocytic uptake despite the ability of this virus to cause cell-cell fusion .\nThe present study confirms and extends previous publications on MHV entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis , . Both siRNAs downregulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis-associated proteins, such as clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) and Dynamin 2 (DNM2), and agents affecting this uptake pathway (Chlopro, Dynasore, Dyngo-4a) were capable of inhibiting infection with MHV. Importantly, these findings could be confirmed in our novel replication-independent virus-cell fusion assay, thereby directly showing an involvement of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in entry of MHV. Analysis of several accessory factors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis showed that clathrin-mediated entry of MHV strain A59 depends on clathrin-adaptor DAB2, but not on EPS15 or AAK1. Previously, clathrin-mediated entry of MHV strain 2 was also shown to be independent of EPS15 .\n\nQuestion: What happens during viral interference between two viruses?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "During viral interference, when two viruses compete for infection of the same host cell, several outcomes can occur. One virus may successfully replicate while the other is excluded, a phenomenon known as mutual exclusion. This was originally described in bacteriophages by Delbrück in 1945. Mutual exclusion implies that the virus particle which infects first alters the host cell in such a way that a second infection is unlikely. The excluded viruses may interfere with the replication of the winning virus, referred to as a \"depressor effect.\" In some instances, exclusion causes the out-competed virus to be rapidly degraded.\n\nViruses counteract other host defense mechanisms during viral interference through various strategies. For example, the hepatitis B virus (HBV) uses immune evasion strategies such as the antagonism of immune function through the use of homologues of cytokine receptors, expression of viral proteins which interact with cytokine signal transduction, and expression of cytokine mimics and host proteins that influence the Th1 and/or Th2 cytokine responses. These immune modulatory strategies can protect the host from the lethal inflammatory effects as well as inhibit the local inflammatory response elicited to kill the HBV.\n\nIn summary, during viral interference, mutual exclusion and depressor effects are key outcomes. However, the process is also influenced by complex molecular interactions, including the manipulation of RNA silencing pathways, the activation of the DNA damage response, the evasion or modulation of TLR signaling, and the involvement of specific proteases in viral entry and replication. Additionally, viruses can counteract host defense mechanisms through immune evasion strategies, such as those employed by the hepatitis B virus. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing antiviral strategies and therapies.\n\nThe surrounding protein coat of a virus is called the **capsid** and it is composed of protein subunits called **capsomeres**."}

BALCO marketed tetrahydrogestrinone (\"the Clear\"), a then-undetected, performance-enhancing steroid developed by chemist Patrick Arnold.

What about the state of her sport?\nJones answered every question with the grace of royalty, the precision of a lawyer and the dexterity of a politician.\n''I believe in a drug-free sport and drug-free competition,'' Jones said.\nFinally, Skip Stolley, the meet organizer of the Millrose Games, stepped in and interrupted.

Comprised of a mixture of approximately 50% testosterone and 50% epitestosterone this drug was absolutely undetectable; no matter how many test applied the athlete would pass every single time.

In 2003, journalists Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada investigated the company's role in a drug sports scandal later referred to as the BALCO Affair. BALCO marketed tetrahydrogestrinone (\"the Clear\"), a then-undetected, performance-enhancing steroid developed by chemist Patrick Arnold. Conte, BALCO vice president James Valente, weight trainer Greg Anderson and coach Remi Korchemny had supplied a number of high-profile sports stars from the United States and Europe with \"the Clear\" and human growth hormone for several years.\nHeadquartered in Burlingame, California, BALCO was founded in 1984. Officially, BALCO was a service business for blood and urine analysis and food supplements. In 1988, Victor Conte offered free blood and urine tests to a group of athletes known as the BALCO Olympians. He then was allowed to attend the Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. From 1996, Conte worked with well-known American football star Bill Romanowski, who proved to be useful to establish new connections to athletes and coaches such as Korchemny. Conte and Korchemny shortly thereafter founded the ZMA Track Club for marketing purposes, well-known members of it being sprinters Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery. In 2000, Conte managed to contact American baseball star Barry Bonds via Greg Anderson, a coach working in a nearby fitness studio. Bonds then delivered contacts to other baseball professionals.\nIn 2003, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California began investigating BALCO. U.S. sprint coach Trevor Graham had given an anonymous phone call to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in June 2003 accusing a number of athletes being involved in doping with a steroid that was not detectable at the time. He also named Victor Conte as the source of the steroid.

NORTON, Associated Press Writer\nApril 28, 2006\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A noted scientist in the field of sports nutritional supplements pleaded guilty Friday to supplying the BALCO lab with the performance-enhancing drug known as \"the clear.\"\nPatrick Arnold pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute steroids. He's scheduled to be sentenced in August and most likely will face three months in jail and three months of home detention.\n\"I agreed to distribute and in fact I did distribute anabolic steroids to two individuals who then knowingly provided these steroids to athletes,\" Arnold told U.S. District Judge Susan Illston.\nArnold left the federal courthouse without talking to reporters.\nA federal grand jury indicted Arnold in November for conspiring with Bay Area Laboratory-Cooperative founder Victor Conte to distribute the once-undetectable substance tetrahydragestrinone. He initially faced three conspiracy counts, but two were dropped in exchange for his plea.\nArnold's plea comes as a grand jury investigates whether San Francisco Giants slugger Barry Bonds lied about using \"the clear\" to another grand jury that investigated BALCO more than two years ago. It was unclear if the plea agreement requires Arnold to testify before the grand jury.\nSo far, the BALCO probe has netted guilty pleas from Arnold, Conte, Bonds' trainer Greg Anderson, BALCO vice president James Valente and track coach Remi Korchemny.\nThe 39-year-old Arnold was snared after federal agents raided his Champaign, Ill., lab last year.\nProsecutors said Arnold was intimately involved with distributing steroids through BALCO from 2000 to 2003, and at one point wired a large sum of money to China for the ingredients to make the drugs.\nArnold was \"involved knowingly with a conspiracy to illegally distribute steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to professional and elite athletes,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Nedrow said in court.\nNedrow said witnesses and documents seized from Arnold's home and BALCO's Burlingame, Calif., labs would have buttressed their case.\nDefense attorneys refused to comment outside court.\nAccording to leaked excerpts of Bonds' testimony reported in the San Francisco Chronicle, Bonds told the BALCO grand jury he used a \"clear\" substance and a cream given to him by Anderson.\n\nDocument 7: At the beginning, they called it \"Project Bingo.\" It became better known as the BALCO investigation.\nOnce again, the probe into athletes' steroid use is redefining\nAmerica's pastime along with a few other sports, causing some to\nwonder if we can really believe what we see. Others simply yearn\nfor the day when this will all go away.\nBarry Bonds. Roger Clemens. Marion Jones. And now, Alex\nRodriguez. Their reputations have been tainted forever, and none of\nit would have been possible without an investigation that began\nwith a dig through a trash bin and a syringe that arrived\nanonymously in the mail one day.\n\"I had a pretty strong inkling, but no idea of the depth and\nmagnitude and number of athletes,\" said Don Catlin, the scientist\nwho tested the contents of the syringe and became the first to\nidentify the designer steroid THG. \"It wasn't so much the number\nof athletes as much as their names.\"\nThe name Barry Bonds stood out among those that IRS special\nagent Jeff Novitzky saw during his investigation, highlighted by\nhis digs through the trash in the back of the Bay Area Laboratory\nCo-Operative starting in the spring of 2003.\nBonds stands charged with lying to a grand jury when he denied\nknowingly using performance-enhancing drugs, and his trial is\nscheduled to start March 2.\nWhether he's convicted or not, his name and his achievements -\nespecially that hallowed home run record - have been sullied. A-Rod\nis on pace to eventually overtake Bonds' record, but now all his\naccomplishments come into question, too.\nThere are 103 names besides Rodriguez's on a list of baseball\nplayers who tested positive in 2003 - names that wouldn't have been\non any list were it not for the BALCO investigation, which merged\nwith a similar probe being conducted by the U.S. Anti-Doping\nAgency; that one was called \"Project Bingo.\"\n\"It has continued to astound me,\" Catlin said. \"It astounds\nme in a sense that once you start working in this field, nothing\nsurprises you anymore.\"\nNovitzky's digging led to indictments and convictions against\nBALCO's founder, Victor Conte, and others.\n\nDocument 8: GOP ACCUSED OF PLAYING POLITICS WITH BALCO\nBy Phillip Matier and Andrew Ross\nThese days everything is political -- so it should come as no surprise that the crackdown on steroids in sports is producing some political fireworks.\nAt issue here: the nonprofit anti-doping agency leading the crackdown on Olympic athletes, and its very interesting Republican ties.\nIt's all igniting with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's recent decision to pursue a case against Olympic sprinter superstar Marion Jones, based on government evidence from the BALCO steroid case.\n\"I don't have a problem with (the agency) targeting high-profile athletes if they are cheating,'' said Bob Weiner, who served as spokesman for the White House drug policy under President Bill Clinton.\n\"But you can't target people who are innocent and try to make them guilty, and with the specifics of the Marion Jones case that seems to be happening.''\nThe anti-doping agency thinks it has plenty of reasons to go after Jones, the five-time Olympic medalist, and they have nothing to do with politics.\nThe feds found a folder in a September raid on BALCO that had Jones' name and a calendar that looked like a scheduled use of banned drugs.\nShe had a longtime association with BALCO boss Victor Conte, and shot- putter ex-husband C.J. Hunter was banned from the Sydney Games in 2000 for using banned substances.\nJones insists she's never used banned drugs.\nTo Weiner -- who isn't involved in Jones' case -- and some of the sprinter's supporters, one of the problems is that the anti-doping agency has become \"a Republican tool'' in its agenda to crusade against drugs.\nRecords show that the nonprofit received nearly $7 million last year -- or about two-thirds of its funding -- from a grant dispensed by the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.\nThe anti-doping agency hired the American Continental Group, a high- powered Washington law firm with big Republican credentials, to help lobby for federal funding, both from the White House and Congress.\nLobbying reports show that the anti-doping agency paid American Continental $78,124 in 2002, and between $60,000 and $100,000 last year.\nAt the same time, the firm's two lawyers assigned to the agency, Shawn Smeallie and David Metzner, are both \"Pioneers\" when it comes to donations to President Bush.\n\nDocument 9: First in a series\nSeveral weeks before doping allegations of epic proportions brought widespread media attention over the weekend, Alberto Salazar’s name was at the center of serious doping allegations that also triggered major coverage.\nA BBC/ProPublica investigative report released in early June, alleges the Nike Oregon Project coach first gave star pupil Galen Rupp, silver medalist in the 10,000 meters and runnerup to training partner Mo Farah at the 2012 London Games and seven-time national champion in that race, testosterone, a banned performance-enhancing drug, at age 16. It’s also alleged that Salazar “regularly works around rules regarding prescription medicines,” runnersworld.com summarized.\n“Therapeutic Use Exemptions, or TUEs,” the website noted, “allow athletes to take for medical reasons prescription medications otherwise not allowed by anti-doping rules. A main allegation against Salazar has been that he helps runners be improperly diagnosed with conditions, especially asthma and hypothyroidism, so that they can receive TUEs.”\nSalazar, a three-time New York City Marathon winner in succession (1980-82), vehemently denied the charges in a combative, two-part rebuttal, nearly 12,000 words in all, that was posted online. Salazar, however, “confirmed . . . he tested testosterone gel on both of his sons,” runnersworld.com wrote.\nVictor Conte, the BALCO founder who served four months in prison for his role in supplying around 30 athletes, including MLB, NFL and track and field stars, with PEDs, starting in 2000 until federal agents raided BALCO headquarters in ’03, said Salazar’s professional ethics are highly questionable.\nIn a recent phone interview with The Japan Times, Conte, now an outspoken anti-doping advocate, noted that Dr. Don Catlin, who founded the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, a drug-testing lab, in 1982, and is now CEO and president of Anti-Doping Research, Inc. has been quoted as saying “(Salazar) seemed to be always coming up with a variety of performance-enhancing substances that he was attempting to get these exemptions for and most of which were denied. Don Catlin has gone on the record saying that he’s been suspicious of Alberto Salazar for many years.\n\nDocument 10: Gut wrenching and completely unbelievable , as the player, was far from convincing with his web of deceit and lies, which were further enhanced by many of the rather idiotic questions asked by Katie Couric , herself .

Now in another turn of events the player’s name has once again been linked to another BALCO like “scandal” , that could have some serious reverberations around the league as well as damaging the Yankees’ alleged ” pristine image ” .\nCourtesy of Yahoo Sports\nBy Jeff Passan , Yahoo Sports\nA man in south Florida supplied performance-enhancing drugs to more than half a dozen major league players, including Alex Rodriguez, according to a Miami New Times report that officials at Major League Baseball believe will grow into a doping scandal that could rival the BALCO case that tarnished Barry Bonds.\nAlex Rodriguez is once again at the center of a possible PED scandal. The newspaper reported Tuesday morning that Anthony Bosch, a self-styled biochemist seen frequently in Latin American baseball circles, distributed large amounts of human growth hormone, synthetic testosterone and other cocktails of PEDs to players who previously had not been linked, such as Texas Rangers outfielder Nelson Cruz.\nSome of the players could be subject to a 50-game suspension for a violation of the league’s PED policy, a league official told Yahoo! Sports. Three of Bosch’s alleged clients – outfielder Melky Cabrera, pitcher Bartolo Colon and catcher Yasmani Grandal – already have been caught and suspended by the league.\nFollowing a relatively quiet period, PED busts spiked in baseball last season. From Ryan Braun’s positive test for testosterone – which got overturned because of alleged mishandling of evidence – to the suspensions of Cabrera, Colon, Grandal, Freddy Galvis, Marlon Byrd, Guillermo Mota and Carlos Ruiz, baseball is facing a renaissance of use, one it believes centered in south Florida.\nClick on link to read this article in full.\n\nDocument 11: Securities and Exchange Commission and the Ontario Securities Commission began investigating financial restatements that said the company was doing well despite internal discussions about a market downturn.

RHODEN\nPublished: February 5, 2004\nMARION JONES stood on a podium at the New York Athletic Club yesterday fielding questions from an audience of reporters and young runners. She talked about her comeback; her new baby, Tim; her excitement at competing in her first Millrose Games. Then the questions turned toward scandals that have engulfed the track world and have marginally involved her. What about her relationship with Charlie Francis? What about Balco and Victor Conte? What about the state of her sport?\nJones answered every question with the grace of royalty, the precision of a lawyer and the dexterity of a politician.\n''I believe in a drug-free sport and drug-free competition,'' Jones said.\nFinally, Skip Stolley, the meet organizer of the Millrose Games, stepped in and interrupted. Jones was finished answering drug questions. This was about the Millrose Games and her comeback after a yearlong maternity leave.\nFor the second time in two days, someone involved with Jones attempted to define the terms of an interview. During a conference call with a few reporters on Tuesday, a USA Track & Field representative took a voice count of invited guests. She asked an uninvited reporter how he had gotten an invitation. The reporter was allowed to stay for a broad-ranging conversation that covered Jones's comeback, her baby and, once again, questions about performance-enhancing drugs, Balco and Francis.\nTomorrow, in a rare indoor appearance at Madison Square Garden, Jones will run the 60 meters in a race that will also feature Allyson Felix, the 18-year-old Californian who broke Jones's 200-meter high school record last June.\nJones's comeback is intriguing. There are emerging dynamics between three conflicting camps -- a public relations staff trying to fashion a new image for her, one segment of the news media enamored of Jones's charisma and talent, and another part that is following the scent of an emerging drug scandal. With the best of intentions, the people around Jones want to manufacture the news and her image much as they did leading to the 2000 Sydney Games, when Jones's quest for five gold medals became an obsession. (She won three.)\nThere is a new reality, however. Jones is 28 and a mother who has been touched -- however gently -- by the breeze of a scandal involving a sport that she rules.\n\nDocument 15: Remi Korchemny (Russian: Реми Корчемный, born 23. June 1932, Ukraine) is the former sprint coach of a number of high-profile athletes, mainly from the US. He was an early coach for Soviet Olympic champion Valeri Borzov.\nAfter the 1972 Olympics Korchemny moved to America. There he worked as a coach or advisor for a number of high-profile athletes, including British sprinter Dwain Chambers, and American athletes Kelli White, Chryste Gaines, Chris Phillips, Alvin Harrison, John Register and Jamaican athlete Grace Jackson.\nKorchemny was one of the main figures in the 2003 BALCO scandal. In 2006 he admitted in a federal investigation to having supplied prescription drugs (not banned) drugs to athletes between 2000 and 2003. In February 2006, Korchemny was sentenced to one year of probation for this. In the aftermath of the scandal Korchemny agreed to retire in 2007. He was the first coach disciplined by the United States Anti-Doping Agency.\n- Mark Fainary-Wada: Track coach gets probation in BALCO scandal San Francisco Chronicle, 24.

The Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) was a San Francisco Bay Area business that supplied anabolic steroids to professional athletes. The scandal came to light in 2003 when journalists Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada investigated BALCO's role in a drug sports scandal. The scandal was concentrated on the distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to several high-profile athletes in the United States and Europe by BALCO founder Victor Conte, among others. This scandal highlighted the widespread use of illegal substances in sports and led to significant reforms in doping regulations and testing procedures."}
{"id": 41, "question": "What are the different types of VAR partnership models available for SaaS products?", "passages": [{"passage": "To work with vendors, VARs have to become authorized and meet certain requirements. For example, some vendors like HubSpot require partners to hit yearly revenue targets, or take technical and sales training programs and become certified sellers.\nFor example, when customers are researching software, they may find that the software they need doesn’t exist in one package; a VAR can help customize the software to their specific requirements. VARs are particularly helpful for certain industries. In fact, many VARs specialize in certain industries such as the financial or healthcare industries, so they understand the regulations and technical requirements of their customers, and they can provide customized software with greater detail and efficiency because of their knowledge of a specific industry. These VARs also have the background knowledge and data to understand what your market’s pain points are at each stage of the funnel.\nWhile the Value Added Reseller Channel is a popular choice, the traditional VAR model may not be the right choice for all SaaS products. Not to worry, just like putting a porsche engine in a old VW campervan, you can also customize your VAR partner model with an engine that suits your software. You may be able to choose one of the following options:\n- Advocate Partners offer a low-touch partnership where your software will be recommended to the partner’s customers only when it makes sense.\n- Referral partners will pass leads to your company in exchange for commission on either the lead or the sale.\n- Strategic partners offers a higher level of partnership where your company will work more closely with a partner company towards common goals aligned with the same messaging and brand values.\nAt Roketto, being a VAR partner with Hubspot has proven to be a most valuable asset for our customers. Using Hubspot marketing software makes our process more efficient and gives us immediate access to the information we need to develop an effective inbound marketing strategy for our customers that engages at each level of the buyer journey.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:415ec09c-5472-4552-9a9c-958e76198d7a>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "As a SaaS company, you know that using channel sales can generate more business and increase revenue without hiring a sales team. However, it is important to choose a sales channel that suits your business model, and even better if the channel you choose adds value for your potential customer and can help you guide them through the software buying process.\nThere are three common types of channel relationships that SaaS companies can use. Cost, flexibility and market adaptability are three major factors that will determine which channel to choose, and you need to understand which channel relates best to your customers’ requirements. The three sales channels are:\nApplication Developer Model\nThe Application Developer Model is slightly different in that the vendor directly supports the customer and the customer pays the vendor. However, a third party can help the customer set up or customize the vendor’s software. For example, Zoho CRM sells its service directly to customers and customers pay them directly.\nBrokerage Channel Model\nThe Brokerage Channel Model helps customize software for customers. This may entail bundling or stacking software to customize a solution for customers; this method can also include account management. It’s similar to an insurance broker sourcing and building a policy for you and works best for simple SaaS products that focus on high transactional requirements.\nValue Added Reseller (VAR)\nVAR provides customers with a fully customized software service. The reseller builds, operates, services and supports and also invoices the customer. The reseller will then pay a license fee or royalties back to the vendor or in some cases the customer can pay the license fee directly to the vendor.\nFor example, Roketto is a HubSpot Certified Partner, which means that we can sell HubSpot Licenses to our clients. Clients who buy a HubSpot license through Roketto are usually going to work with us for inbound marketing services, and the Hubspot software helps us in our service delivery, marketing strategy and with measuring and tracking results.\nAnd because Roketto is a VAR certified partner with Hubspot, we can provide them with a special link that lets them save money on the regular $3000 onboarding fee.

Finally, for SaaS products that are not fully configurable, or for very complex operations, some customization may be required in modules that interface to SaaS products.\nSaaS sales models vary widely, but all are more internet focused. Freemium models are common for low cost products which can provide a base level of functionality at no cost, ideally paid for by advertising revenue. The intent is to provide sufficient value to “up-sell” to the paid version, typically costing $10 or less per month. These SaaS products are sold by “no-touch” internet sales and marketing. Products that are somewhat higher priced rely on internet marketing supported sales with the potential for online chat. Enterprise SaaS products are sold directly or through a channel, due to their complexity and likely services component. These Enterprise SaaS products are heavily supported by internet marketing which helps educate the customer and reduce the direct sales costs.\nStrategies vary greatly depending on the horizontal or vertical market served. Different markets have differing propensities to move to SaaS and different competitive landscapes. Generally SMB markets have a greater demand for SaaS with the desire to reduce in-house IT complexity, a reduced need for customization, and reduced integration requirements. Certain vertical markets such as medical and financial have greater security, up-time, and compliance requirements which may increase the time to move to a SaaS solution. Consumers are now very comfortable with “applications in the cloud”, and do not have a “switching cost” from current applications.

Therefore, companies do not have to deal with the configuration or maintenance of the software themselves. You only pay for a subscription and that gives you access to the application.\nIf updates or new functions are developed for the application, these are generally made available to all customers. The majority of SaaS applications are off-the-shelf, plug-and-play products, where the vendor manages everything behind the application, including:\n- Hardware components such as networks, storage and servers in the data center\n- Platforms such as virtualization, operating system, and middleware (application independent programs that mediate between applications)\n- Software requirements such as runtimes (how long a program runs), data, and the application itself\nOther applications can also be integrated with SaaS software through application programming interfaces (APIs). For example, you can link your CRM software and your ERP software to use the synergies between the applications.\nCharacteristics of SaaS services\n- Shared cloud architecture (or multi-tenant cloud architecture): all users use a centrally managed infrastructure.\n- Access from any device connected to the Internet: Data and information can be accessed from anywhere in real time, making synchronization easy.\n- Great usability via familiar web interfaces: Application user interfaces are often structured similarly to websites. Since the user already knows the structure, this accelerates the acceptance of the software in the company.\n- Collaborative features: By centrally storing the data and features that enable collaboration, collaboration can be designed efficiently across teams or sites.\nSaaS offers your business a number of key benefits.\nLow investment risk\nSince there are no costs for hardware and infrastructure when introducing SaaS applications, the investment is lower than for an on-premises solution. Studies show that the investment costs are even 30% lower in comparison – regardless of the number of users.\nSaaS providers attach great importance to the fact that their software is always available and therefore rely on redundant systems.

When the buyer is at the evaluation stage of the journey, you can help customers realize that your software is the answer to their problems and that it is the best choice on the market by publishing content that answers the questions and concerns they may have.

Companies can now leverage partnerships to deploy charging infrastructure, lower payback time, and incentivize customers to shop while charging. For instance, supermarkets and shopping malls can build chargers and offer discounts, loyalty points, and other incentives to customers using their charging infrastructure. Zunder has partnered with Nissan to offer a 50% discount on any of their CHAdeMO chargers at their charging stations, while Parking Energy has collaborated with four of Finland’s leading parking operators to provide customers with easy access to their charging stations.\nCompanies now also offer a “bundled” installation model, selling multiple solutions bundled into a single offering. Gridserve is one such example, providing a comprehensive package that includes the installation of EV charging stations, solar panels, EV leasing, and more. Stations-e is another example, offering a local fast-charging stations network and installing high speed mobile networks + other ancillary services. Another example of bundled offering is charging software where charging software can optimise a wide array of charging improvements e.g. balancing peak grid demand, reducing strain on the electricity network, managing charge times and levels etc – please refer to our EV Charging Software article.\nLastly, the market standardisation of charging protocols and its wider adoption will drive the best possible user experience. A prime example of this is ISO 15118’s Plug & Charge, which eliminates the need for users to use multiple different apps for different networks or credit cards. This standard specifies communication between EVs and charging stations, enabling Plug and Charge functionality. This standardisation will drive go-to-market innovations by providing a healthier set of charging options for consumers that are not siloed to individual brands.\nInnovations in charging are driving fundamental shifts in how charging can be done (instead of today’s plug-in-only solutions).\nBroad spectrum of functionalities:\nEV companies are developing a variety of plug-in charging options for various EV charging needs. For example, Virta offers a comprehensive range of charging services, including standard, fast and ultra-fast charging. This enables a more reliable and efficient charging experience and gives users more flexibility regarding when and where they charge their vehicles. Trojan Energy has developed a flat and flush on-street charging solution, with the charging points staying underground when not used so there is more street space available.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:03a369c2-f9c3-4189-9183-180829133b2a>::chunk-1"]}, {"passage": "There are dozens of possible ways to develop software. A wide variety of existing programming languages with their own strong and weak sides, frameworks, libraries, and other development tools allow creating applications of different types: for desktops, for mobile devices, web applications that work via browser, etc. Different software development methodologies and frameworks like Scrum or Kanban will help you adapt the development process for various types of projects, reduce costs, eliminate risks, and use the available resources more efficient. But besides the development itself, there’s another important issue that requires close attention. We’re talking about the way of licensing and delivering the software.\nWhen there’s a need to choose what framework, technology, or a programming language should be used during the development process, in most cases, the development company makes the final decision and the customer relies on the developer’s experience and skills. But the chosen software delivery model affects both the customer and the developer because different models have different pros and cons and require different development strategy.\nIn this article, we’ll talk about one of the existing software licensing and delivery models named Software as a Service, or SaaS, to be short, and the key benefits it offers.\nWhat is SaaS?\nSaaS is a centrally hosted software that is provided to a customer in the form of a service on a subscription basis. The applications of such kind run on the servers of SaaS providers and users can access them via browsers. Instead of buying an application, a user pays a “rent” that allows him to use it for a certain amount of time. Thus, users can decrease the use cost, which is one of the primary benefits of using SaaS. There’s no need for a user to think about the technical issues since the SaaS provider takes care of it.\nLet’s continue with the main SaaS advantages and benefits for a customer.\nMain Advantages and Benefits for Customer\nWhen we talk about an application without singling out specific features, we usually mean in-house software, software that was created for using within the organization. In this case, the customer is responsible for the support of hardware, databases, storage, security issues, and other important aspects of successfully running application. As you can imagine, this approach entails high costs due to the necessity for a team of IT specialists and regular expertise.\nFor a small business or state-owned enterprises, this may become a headache. One of the possible solutions is SaaS.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:aaccc702-355e-49c0-9d44-f5830552381a>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "How does ATI’s Value Added Reseller program re-shape the buying process for potential commercial customers of Array Technologies, Inc.?\nThe distinct advantage for our customers is now they can receive all the ancillary services (Pull-testing, Foundation Design & Procurement, and Mechanical Install) in one convenient place, rather than having to put together their tracker project piecemeal.\nGive us a snapshot of what goes into selecting a VAR partner?\nOur first VAR was Russell Pacific, which is run by ATI’s former VP of Sales, Eb Russell.

Every factual claim must have a citation.\n\nDocuments:\nDocument 1: To work with vendors, VARs have to become authorized and meet certain requirements. For example, some vendors like HubSpot require partners to hit yearly revenue targets, or take technical and sales training programs and become certified sellers.\nFor example, when customers are researching software, they may find that the software they need doesn’t exist in one package; a VAR can help customize the software to their specific requirements. VARs are particularly helpful for certain industries. In fact, many VARs specialize in certain industries such as the financial or healthcare industries, so they understand the regulations and technical requirements of their customers, and they can provide customized software with greater detail and efficiency because of their knowledge of a specific industry. These VARs also have the background knowledge and data to understand what your market’s pain points are at each stage of the funnel.\nWhile the Value Added Reseller Channel is a popular choice, the traditional VAR model may not be the right choice for all SaaS products. Not to worry, just like putting a porsche engine in a old VW campervan, you can also customize your VAR partner model with an engine that suits your software. You may be able to choose one of the following options:\n- Advocate Partners offer a low-touch partnership where your software will be recommended to the partner’s customers only when it makes sense.\n- Referral partners will pass leads to your company in exchange for commission on either the lead or the sale.\n- Strategic partners offers a higher level of partnership where your company will work more closely with a partner company towards common goals aligned with the same messaging and brand values.\nAt Roketto, being a VAR partner with Hubspot has proven to be a most valuable asset for our customers. Using Hubspot marketing software makes our process more efficient and gives us immediate access to the information we need to develop an effective inbound marketing strategy for our customers that engages at each level of the buyer journey.\n\nDocument 2: As a SaaS company, you know that using channel sales can generate more business and increase revenue without hiring a sales team. However, it is important to choose a sales channel that suits your business model, and even better if the channel you choose adds value for your potential customer and can help you guide them through the software buying process.\nThere are three common types of channel relationships that SaaS companies can use. Cost, flexibility and market adaptability are three major factors that will determine which channel to choose, and you need to understand which channel relates best to your customers’ requirements. The three sales channels are:\nApplication Developer Model\nThe Application Developer Model is slightly different in that the vendor directly supports the customer and the customer pays the vendor. However, a third party can help the customer set up or customize the vendor’s software. For example, Zoho CRM sells its service directly to customers and customers pay them directly.\nBrokerage Channel Model\nThe Brokerage Channel Model helps customize software for customers. This may entail bundling or stacking software to customize a solution for customers; this method can also include account management. It’s similar to an insurance broker sourcing and building a policy for you and works best for simple SaaS products that focus on high transactional requirements.\nValue Added Reseller (VAR)\nVAR provides customers with a fully customized software service. The reseller builds, operates, services and supports and also invoices the customer. The reseller will then pay a license fee or royalties back to the vendor or in some cases the customer can pay the license fee directly to the vendor.\nFor example, Roketto is a HubSpot Certified Partner, which means that we can sell HubSpot Licenses to our clients. Clients who buy a HubSpot license through Roketto are usually going to work with us for inbound marketing services, and the Hubspot software helps us in our service delivery, marketing strategy and with measuring and tracking results.\nAnd because Roketto is a VAR certified partner with Hubspot, we can provide them with a special link that lets them save money on the regular $3000 onboarding fee. The client will pay HubSpot directly, but we will provide the client with training and support. However, we are the reseller who makes the sale to the client on the behalf of Hubspot.\n\nDocument 3: Resell our SaaS solutions integrated with your services\nGrow your services and reach new markets as a VAR Partner\nAs a One Network VAR partner you will have the resources and knowledge to build expertise on One Network SaaS solutions. VARs can resell One Network applications to One Network customers as well as new customers. One Network is building ecosystems of consultants and ISVs around our industry cores to encourage specialization and tailoring of services and solutions that encapsulate the nuances of the target industry. Key industries include Automotive, Food Services, High Tech, CPG, Retail, Healthcare, Military, Logistics, and Pharma. One Network charges VARs a monthly fee per user and per business transaction for each application sold.\nRequest to Join Our VAR Partner Program\nIf you have any questions, please email email@example.com and we’ll get back to you.\n\nDocument 4: SaaS products that must integrate into the Enterprise will require services for integration into those products. Finally, for SaaS products that are not fully configurable, or for very complex operations, some customization may be required in modules that interface to SaaS products.\nSaaS sales models vary widely, but all are more internet focused. Freemium models are common for low cost products which can provide a base level of functionality at no cost, ideally paid for by advertising revenue. The intent is to provide sufficient value to “up-sell” to the paid version, typically costing $10 or less per month. These SaaS products are sold by “no-touch” internet sales and marketing. Products that are somewhat higher priced rely on internet marketing supported sales with the potential for online chat. Enterprise SaaS products are sold directly or through a channel, due to their complexity and likely services component. These Enterprise SaaS products are heavily supported by internet marketing which helps educate the customer and reduce the direct sales costs.\nStrategies vary greatly depending on the horizontal or vertical market served. Different markets have differing propensities to move to SaaS and different competitive landscapes. Generally SMB markets have a greater demand for SaaS with the desire to reduce in-house IT complexity, a reduced need for customization, and reduced integration requirements. Certain vertical markets such as medical and financial have greater security, up-time, and compliance requirements which may increase the time to move to a SaaS solution. Consumers are now very comfortable with “applications in the cloud”, and do not have a “switching cost” from current applications. Consumer markets are most cost conscious and can be highly competitive. Cloud Strategies will work with you in whatever market you focus on.\nWho We Work for\nVenture Capitalists and Private Equity Firms\nProviding assessments and due diligence reports to evaluate the company’s SaaS business strategy, or to scope the opportunities and risks to transforming a software business to a higher value SaaS model.\nProviding independent assessments to explore the opportunity for the company to move to a SaaS model, or assist in the implementation of a SaaS model.\nProviding expert SaaS resources to facilitate the financing, building, and running of a successful SaaS businesses. We work with company management to develop and build a successful new SaaS company or transform an existing software company to successfully support a SaaS model.\n\nDocument 5: Software vendors choose one of the following delivery models or a combination of both:\n- Hosting on its own servers, databases, networks and IT resources\n- With public cloud service providers, who manages the cloud environment on which the SaaS solution is hosted\nSaaS applications are typically accessed through web browsers. Therefore, companies do not have to deal with the configuration or maintenance of the software themselves. You only pay for a subscription and that gives you access to the application.\nIf updates or new functions are developed for the application, these are generally made available to all customers. The majority of SaaS applications are off-the-shelf, plug-and-play products, where the vendor manages everything behind the application, including:\n- Hardware components such as networks, storage and servers in the data center\n- Platforms such as virtualization, operating system, and middleware (application independent programs that mediate between applications)\n- Software requirements such as runtimes (how long a program runs), data, and the application itself\nOther applications can also be integrated with SaaS software through application programming interfaces (APIs). For example, you can link your CRM software and your ERP software to use the synergies between the applications.\nCharacteristics of SaaS services\n- Shared cloud architecture (or multi-tenant cloud architecture): all users use a centrally managed infrastructure.\n- Access from any device connected to the Internet: Data and information can be accessed from anywhere in real time, making synchronization easy.\n- Great usability via familiar web interfaces: Application user interfaces are often structured similarly to websites. Since the user already knows the structure, this accelerates the acceptance of the software in the company.\n- Collaborative features: By centrally storing the data and features that enable collaboration, collaboration can be designed efficiently across teams or sites.\nSaaS offers your business a number of key benefits.\nLow investment risk\nSince there are no costs for hardware and infrastructure when introducing SaaS applications, the investment is lower than for an on-premises solution. Studies show that the investment costs are even 30% lower in comparison – regardless of the number of users.\nSaaS providers attach great importance to the fact that their software is always available and therefore rely on redundant systems. This means that comparable systems are available in parallel at least twice.\nThis ensures that data, systems, networks, etc. remain available even in the event of an error and that errors can be corrected without failure.\n\nDocument 6: Even though a VAR will sell your product and probably market it, the SaaS company still plays the biggest role and will reap great benefits from marketing efforts to create demand for their products.\nEngage Buyers in the Software Evaluation Process\nFor these SaaS companies that need to promote a new product or stand out from the competition, inbound marketing can help engage buyers at every level of the buyer journey by delivering information that relates to their research. When the buyer is at the evaluation stage of the journey, you can help customers realize that your software is the answer to their problems and that it is the best choice on the market by publishing content that answers the questions and concerns they may have. For instance, when the buyer is going through the software evaluation process, you could publish a software buyer guide that informs the buyer of the pros and cons of similar software products on the market.\nJust as we take stock of what we want and need when buying a car, and then research each vehicle before heading to the car dealers, buyers will conduct over 60% of their research online before contacting a seller. According to TechTarget 65% of IT buyers will consume at least four pieces of content before contacting the vendor, and the 2014 B2B Buyer Behavior Survey from Demand Gen states that over 61% of buyers will choose the vendor that supplied relevant information at each stage of their journey.\nIt’s all about building trust in your product and company.

Many SaaS startups recognise the advantage in partnering with larger companies that have a more established brand name, a broader network, and a larger sales and marketing team.\nSaaS and the Value Added Reseller Channel\nSaaS companies that choose the VAR channel can offer customers the added assurance of a one-stop shop of customized software and ongoing support. On top of IT services, the VAR channel may also offer customers professional services such as consulting, design and training.\n\nDocument 7: Cloud Strategies Services for SaaS Vendors\nThe challenges of SaaS startups and companies transforming to SaaS are different.\nCloud Strategies can help.\nEach client’s requirements are unique, depending on the objectives of the client, the type of SaaS company profile, the stage of the company’s adoption of a SaaS model, and the resources required. Cloud Strategies can provide an independent assessment of a software company’s SaaS strategy for investors and boards, or work directly with the company to maximize its opportunity for success. Cloud Strategies can work at a high level providing an assessment and recommendations in an advisory role, or become an integral part of the company team to make their SaaS Business Work.\nSaaS Company Profiles\nThe SaaS delivery and business models encompass a very wide variety of types of companies. The SaaS strategy will vary greatly, dependent on five primary characteristics of the SaaS company.\nGreenfield or Established Businesses\nStart-ups have the advantage of a clean slate, but don’t have the resources, image recognition, or channels of established players. Existing software vendors have many advantages, but the transition to SaaS can create competition with their existing products, additional working capital requirements, and issues with their existing channel.\nLow or High Price Offering\nMany basic SaaS products like Dropbox have a base edition that is free and entice their customers to move up to a paid version costing $5 to $10 per user per month.

Zunder has partnered with Nissan to offer a 50% discount on any of their CHAdeMO chargers at their charging stations, while Parking Energy has collaborated with four of Finland’s leading parking operators to provide customers with easy access to their charging stations.\nCompanies now also offer a “bundled” installation model, selling multiple solutions bundled into a single offering. Gridserve is one such example, providing a comprehensive package that includes the installation of EV charging stations, solar panels, EV leasing, and more. Stations-e is another example, offering a local fast-charging stations network and installing high speed mobile networks + other ancillary services. Another example of bundled offering is charging software where charging software can optimise a wide array of charging improvements e.g. balancing peak grid demand, reducing strain on the electricity network, managing charge times and levels etc – please refer to our EV Charging Software article.\nLastly, the market standardisation of charging protocols and its wider adoption will drive the best possible user experience. A prime example of this is ISO 15118’s Plug & Charge, which eliminates the need for users to use multiple different apps for different networks or credit cards. This standard specifies communication between EVs and charging stations, enabling Plug and Charge functionality. This standardisation will drive go-to-market innovations by providing a healthier set of charging options for consumers that are not siloed to individual brands.\nInnovations in charging are driving fundamental shifts in how charging can be done (instead of today’s plug-in-only solutions).\nBroad spectrum of functionalities:\nEV companies are developing a variety of plug-in charging options for various EV charging needs. For example, Virta offers a comprehensive range of charging services, including standard, fast and ultra-fast charging. This enables a more reliable and efficient charging experience and gives users more flexibility regarding when and where they charge their vehicles. Trojan Energy has developed a flat and flush on-street charging solution, with the charging points staying underground when not used so there is more street space available.\n\nDocument 11: There are dozens of possible ways to develop software. A wide variety of existing programming languages with their own strong and weak sides, frameworks, libraries, and other development tools allow creating applications of different types: for desktops, for mobile devices, web applications that work via browser, etc. Different software development methodologies and frameworks like Scrum or Kanban will help you adapt the development process for various types of projects, reduce costs, eliminate risks, and use the available resources more efficient. But besides the development itself, there’s another important issue that requires close attention. We’re talking about the way of licensing and delivering the software.\nWhen there’s a need to choose what framework, technology, or a programming language should be used during the development process, in most cases, the development company makes the final decision and the customer relies on the developer’s experience and skills. But the chosen software delivery model affects both the customer and the developer because different models have different pros and cons and require different development strategy.\nIn this article, we’ll talk about one of the existing software licensing and delivery models named Software as a Service, or SaaS, to be short, and the key benefits it offers.\nWhat is SaaS?\nSaaS is a centrally hosted software that is provided to a customer in the form of a service on a subscription basis. The applications of such kind run on the servers of SaaS providers and users can access them via browsers. Instead of buying an application, a user pays a “rent” that allows him to use it for a certain amount of time. Thus, users can decrease the use cost, which is one of the primary benefits of using SaaS. There’s no need for a user to think about the technical issues since the SaaS provider takes care of it.\nLet’s continue with the main SaaS advantages and benefits for a customer.\nMain Advantages and Benefits for Customer\nWhen we talk about an application without singling out specific features, we usually mean in-house software, software that was created for using within the organization. In this case, the customer is responsible for the support of hardware, databases, storage, security issues, and other important aspects of successfully running application. As you can imagine, this approach entails high costs due to the necessity for a team of IT specialists and regular expertise.\nFor a small business or state-owned enterprises, this may become a headache. One of the possible solutions is SaaS.\n\nDocument 12: How does ATI’s Value Added Reseller program re-shape the buying process for potential commercial customers of Array Technologies, Inc.?\nThe distinct advantage for our customers is now they can receive all the ancillary services (Pull-testing, Foundation Design & Procurement, and Mechanical Install) in one convenient place, rather than having to put together their tracker project piecemeal.\nGive us a snapshot of what goes into selecting a VAR partner?\nOur first VAR was Russell Pacific, which is run by ATI’s former VP of Sales, Eb Russell. We were very fortunate to have a first partner who already had an intimate knowledge of ATI and our product. Through Russell Pacific, we learned what attributes a VAR needs to be successful, and that has helped us tremendously in vetting other potential VARs. As it turns out, the criteria is very rigorous. A VAR needs an intimate working knowledge of ATI’s tracker, engineering resources, fantastic customer service, and the ability to provide the ancillary services.\nWhat are a customer’s options if they need a solar tracker, but not a turn-key solution?\nWorking with a VAR is just like ordering off a menu. You only pick the services you want or you can simply choose to procure the tracker without any additional services.\nFor more program information please visit - http://arraytechinc.com/commercial/value-added-reseller-network\nThe content & opinions in this article are the author’s and do not necessarily represent the views of AltEnergyMag\nThis post does not have any comments.

Advocate Partners offer a low-touch partnership where the SaaS software is recommended to the partner's customers only when it makes sense, without a direct commission model. Referral partners pass leads to the SaaS company in exchange for commission on either the lead or the sale. Strategic partners involve a higher level of partnership where the SaaS company works more closely with a partner company towards common goals, sharing messaging and brand values. Industry-specialized VARs provide customized software solutions tailored to specific industries, leveraging their expertise to meet unique customer needs.\n\nIn real-world scenarios, Advocate Partners might subtly integrate SaaS recommendations into their sales pitches, ensuring the solution fits the customer's needs without overt promotion. Referral partners could maintain a database of potential SaaS customers and facilitate introductions, earning a commission based on successful referrals. Strategic partners might co-develop marketing campaigns and jointly strategize on product enhancements. Industry-specialized VARs could tailor SaaS solutions to comply with industry-specific regulations.\n\nKey decision-making techniques in these partnerships often involve aligning goals, fostering open communication, and leveraging each partner's unique strengths. Unethical practices, such as \"bait and switch\" hiring, highlight the importance of transparency and ethical conduct in partnerships.\n\nLegislation and daily life choices are often driven by statistical correlations and regression analyses, influencing financial planning and market dynamics. To accelerate opportunities in the pipeline, measures such as increasing Security Assessment efforts and fostering collaboration between previously isolated teams have been effective.\n\nPromoting equality and challenging discrimination requires respecting beliefs, culture, values, and preferences, modeling inclusive practice, and supporting others to promote equality and rights. Examples of putting guidance into practice involve recognizing external motivations and implementing effective strategies.\n\nIn conclusion, Advocate Partners, Referral partners, Strategic partners, and industry-specialized VARs operate through various models, each offering different levels of involvement and support. Real-world examples illustrate how these partnerships can be effectively managed to expand market presence and provide tailored solutions. Key decision-making techniques emphasize alignment, communication, and leveraging strengths. Unethical practices underscore the need for transparency, while legislation and daily life choices are often influenced by statistical analyses. Accelerating opportunities involves strategic initiatives and fostering collaboration. Promoting equality and challenging discrimination require respect, inclusive practices, and open dialogue. Putting guidance into practice and legitimizing exploration involve recognizing external motivations and implementing effective strategies.\n\nThe impact of these partnership models on SaaS companies and their VAR partners is substantial. SaaS companies benefit from increased market reach and tailored solutions through these partnerships. VAR partners can enhance their offerings and earn revenue through commissions or shared goals. The SaaS model's growth is driven by its ability to offer competitive pricing and flexible subscription models, which can be advantageous for both SaaS companies and VAR partners. However, the shift from traditional software licensing to SaaS requires SaaS companies to adapt their business models and potentially restructure their partnerships to maintain profitability and competitiveness.\n\nIn summary, the different types of VAR partnership models available for SaaS products significantly influence the day-to-day operations of SaaS companies and their VAR partners. These partnerships offer various levels of involvement and support, impacting market reach, solution customization, and revenue generation. The SaaS model's growth and the shift from traditional software licensing necessitate adaptations in business models and partnership structures to maintain competitiveness and profitability."}
{"id": 42, "question": "How does architecture play a role in creating tension in Hitchcock's Rear Window?", "passages": [{"passage": "Hitchcock famously had the entire apartment-courtyard set built and his focus on authenticity was such that, unsatisfied with the height of the apartment blocks (the tallest of which stood 40 feet), he had the basement of the sound studio ripped out and the claustrophobic courtyard built down into it. As a result Jeff’s second floor apartment was in reality at ground level. Many of the apartments also benefited from running water and electricity, and could be lived in, if so desired.\nAlfred Hitchcock – Rear Window\nHaving created the world of Rear Window in line with real world architecture, for Hitchcock to then invert the rules of how architecture is used in the real world throws the audience. Windows become doorways: traditional means of accessing the outside world, they now become the means of access to the occupants and their secrets, both voyeuristically and physically, with characters climbing in and falling out of them. Private rooms become public spaces, with their inhabitants chained to their separate miseries: Miss Lonelyhearts trapped in her empty apartment, the nameless songwriter trapped in his bustling one – both looking for the same thing. From observing and preserving the laws of architecture through only showing these snippets of others lives from the confines of Jeff’s own apartment, Hitchcock builds palpable claustrophobia. A feeling intensified by the purposely restrictive courtyard acting as a heat trap for the negative emotions gestated by the film.\nPevsner was right about the inescapability of buildings. But when captured and created for cinema, architecture can transcend physical space to become indicative of a film’s intentions, central to its psychological and philosophical motifs, becoming doorways beyond the literal.\nGabriel Gane, March 2016\nYou can read Gabriel’s first essay on cinema for Miniclick here…", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:f7ceaad0-b245-4eea-b324-688177d98cd2>::chunk-3"]}, {"passage": "It has infrastructure, in shops, bars, street restaurants, public and private transport, hell it even has parking meters.

In fact, so real are these challenges that most of the tension arises from watching him overcome them, rather then being chased down by the murderous replicant. We watch him push through rotting floors and scale the outside of skyscrapers – scenes that aren’t all that uncommon in the ever popular action franchises. Consider similar sequences in The Fifth Element, in itself not a bad movie, but which holds little tension compared to Blade Runner because the logic of the world created wasn’t built from the ground up, introducing its hostile highs before it’s mundane lows and so to not be truly relatable.\nRidley Scott – Blade Runner\nLuc Besson – The Fifth Element\nA created cinematic world doesn’t have to be fantastical however; Hitchcock’s Rear Window employs the same tropes to great effect. Where Blade Runner’s success is with relatable public space, Rear Window’s is with private, regarding the relationships between locked rooms and their as equally locked residents. This compartmentalisation of characters and plotlines within separate rooms, either conjoining or across a courtyard builds an innate tension, in turn breeding paranoia and perversion, leading Hitchcock to subvert his own created worlds; building in methods of spying and having characters enter and leave rooms through non-traditional modes.\nAlfred Hitchcock – Rear Window\nHitchcock doesn’t limit this to Rear Window, in Psycho, Norman spies on Marion as she undresses via a peephole in his parlour wall, a symptom of the psychosis yet to be revealed.

We move among it, inhabit it; it’s our beehive, our bird’s nest and so it becomes largely invisible to many of us. And yet, in the cinematic world the opposite seems true.

Thank you to Alfred Hitchcock for providing such wonder visions of her in “Rear Window”.

We sit and watch other people’s lives and stories from afar framed by the screen and form opinions and cast judgements on what we are watching. Alfred Hitchcock throws that voyeurism in our faces with “Rear Window”.\n“Rear Window” is a great example of what a master director with a master editor can accomplish. We watch a mostly point-of-view presentation of how a story is created in one’s mind and how that story can infect others that surround a character. We watch as L.B.

As the Bordwell reading stated, “the Kuleshov effect operates here: Our mind connects the two parts of space”, Jeff’s apartment and the courtyard, without the use of an establishing shot. This sequence of cuts is repeated over and over again to develop the movie-like story of his neighbors where he forms his opinions and casts judgements on what he is seeing and hearing. Given the lack of details, he fills in the gaps by coming to his own conclusions based purely on his visual input from afar. This is the Kuleshov effect on the part of Jeff himself. He connects the dots in his own mind based simply on what he sees and hears while he watches the movie of his neighbors unfold.\nFor me, “Rear Window” was a film of a man watching a movie of his neighbors.

One of the most obvious things in the film was the use of different types of camera shots, and visual images to give more meaning to the film and to give a different perspective of things to the viewer. Hitchcock does this by using many different techniques such as different camera shots, shapes, patterns, outfits that the characters wear, and Hitchcock uses a different series of motifs and he puts them to use in very meaningful ways.\nIn the film the use of parallel lines are put to use all the time to give the idea of truth and deception and good and evil. Straight lines are meant to represent the clearness of the situation, for example when Roger Thornhill, the main character, has gone to meet Eve in the woods the viewer isn’t able to see the tree tops which I think is meant to represent that they are enclosed, the trees are also straight up, in this scene Roger Thornhill is told what is going on, or things are made clear to him and also at the end of the film when Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendal are running from Vanddamme’s thugs.\nThe tall straight, truthful trees help to hide the ‘goodies’ from the ‘baddies’. As we cannot see the tops of the trees, a very claustrophobic and enclosed environment is produced. Also, the parallel lines are used in a very different way in the first scene. A high angle shot is used which faces vertically down the sides of tall skyscrapers. These tall buildings have many parallel lines travelling from top to bottom across the building. This suggests that within these buildings are large deceitful and corrupt corporations from which there is no escape, such as the CIA or the UN.\nBendy and twisted lines are meant to show the deception of things that are happening to Thornhill, and things aren’t as clear to him, for example near the beginning of the film when Thornhill has been forced to drink a substantial amount of alcohol and is driving down the road, the road is bendy and you see a point of view camera shot to show what he is seeing and his view is deluded, showing that he doesn’t understand what is going on.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:24a6b429-3b42-4ad5-abd9-2d6b7b6ff268>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Fincher, more so than a great deal of his contemporaries, uses the opening credits of his features to set the mood and the tone of his story in a highly creative and stimulating style.

The film places a subtle, yet strong emphasis on architecture—specifically, an early twentieth-century kind of civic architecture seen in noir films and old New York buildings (a mix of classical and art deco).\nThere’s a distinct claustrophobic feeling to the city David Fincher is portraying, which is reinforced by his framing of several shots from a low angle looking up at the ceiling (implying that the walls are closing in around our characters).\nFincher’s fascination with technology is also reflected in a mix of cutting-edge forensic tools and outdated computer systems that are used by the protagonists to find their man. Lastly, a strong air of nihilism marks Fincher’s filmography, with the incorporation of its philosophy giving SE7EN its pitch-black resonance.\nSeveral story elements, like the moral ambiguity of Detective Mills, the rapid decay of the city aided and abetted by uncaring bureaucrats, and the darkly attractive nature of John Doe’s crimes cause a severe existential crisis for our protagonists.\nSE7EN was a huge hit upon its release, and put David Fincher on the map in a way that ALIEN 3 never did (or could have done)—precisely because it was an original property in which Fincher could assert himself, free from the excessive studio needling that plagued top-dollar franchises back then (and still today).\nThis freedom resulted in one of the most shocking thrillers in recent memory, jolting audiences from apathy and re-energizing a fear response that had been dulled by the onslaught of uninspired slasher films during the 80’s.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:63b7e511-74e6-4593-9ba5-4f643f8bcc0c>::chunk-29"]}, {"passage": "I've always loved this bit of mid-century fantasy architecture that Hollywood created for the Alfred Hitchcock thriller \"North by Northwest\" in 1959.

As a result Jeff’s second floor apartment was in reality at ground level. Many of the apartments also benefited from running water and electricity, and could be lived in, if so desired.\nAlfred Hitchcock – Rear Window\nHaving created the world of Rear Window in line with real world architecture, for Hitchcock to then invert the rules of how architecture is used in the real world throws the audience. Windows become doorways: traditional means of accessing the outside world, they now become the means of access to the occupants and their secrets, both voyeuristically and physically, with characters climbing in and falling out of them. Private rooms become public spaces, with their inhabitants chained to their separate miseries: Miss Lonelyhearts trapped in her empty apartment, the nameless songwriter trapped in his bustling one – both looking for the same thing. From observing and preserving the laws of architecture through only showing these snippets of others lives from the confines of Jeff’s own apartment, Hitchcock builds palpable claustrophobia. A feeling intensified by the purposely restrictive courtyard acting as a heat trap for the negative emotions gestated by the film.\nPevsner was right about the inescapability of buildings. But when captured and created for cinema, architecture can transcend physical space to become indicative of a film’s intentions, central to its psychological and philosophical motifs, becoming doorways beyond the literal.\nGabriel Gane, March 2016\nYou can read Gabriel’s first essay on cinema for Miniclick here…\n\nDocument 2: It has infrastructure, in shops, bars, street restaurants, public and private transport, hell it even has parking meters.

In fact, so real are these challenges that most of the tension arises from watching him overcome them, rather then being chased down by the murderous replicant. We watch him push through rotting floors and scale the outside of skyscrapers – scenes that aren’t all that uncommon in the ever popular action franchises. Consider similar sequences in The Fifth Element, in itself not a bad movie, but which holds little tension compared to Blade Runner because the logic of the world created wasn’t built from the ground up, introducing its hostile highs before it’s mundane lows and so to not be truly relatable.\nRidley Scott – Blade Runner\nLuc Besson – The Fifth Element\nA created cinematic world doesn’t have to be fantastical however; Hitchcock’s Rear Window employs the same tropes to great effect. Where Blade Runner’s success is with relatable public space, Rear Window’s is with private, regarding the relationships between locked rooms and their as equally locked residents. This compartmentalisation of characters and plotlines within separate rooms, either conjoining or across a courtyard builds an innate tension, in turn breeding paranoia and perversion, leading Hitchcock to subvert his own created worlds; building in methods of spying and having characters enter and leave rooms through non-traditional modes.\nAlfred Hitchcock – Rear Window\nHitchcock doesn’t limit this to Rear Window, in Psycho, Norman spies on Marion as she undresses via a peephole in his parlour wall, a symptom of the psychosis yet to be revealed. This voyeurism is only heightened in Rear Window, a story centred around the very act of watching, with the windows of Jeff’s neighbours representative of movie screens, each with their own cast of characters and plot.\n\nDocument 3: Have you ever imagined what the courtyard of the apartments from Alfred Hitchcock's film \"Rear Window\" looked like in full?

In Rear Window these talents really are to the fore, using the teeming tenements of New York as his playground, embellishing it with great colour (both socially and cinematically) and detail.\nAn essay in big city loneliness and morbid curiosity, Rear Window has much to say about Hitch's gleeful reliance on voyeurism both of his audience at the cinema and of the outside world in general, tapping into how we perhaps live(d) via witty symbolism and analogy. I wonder if such a film, if made today, could grab an audiences attention and capture something of urban life now given that as a society we seem to be living a more insular and detached life, reliant on the screens of our laptops and PC's than the window to the streets outside.\nA film about 'spectacle', Rear Window gives us just that and how, thanks to the great aforementioned symbolism and the equally subtle analogies that can be made between Stewart and Kelly's characters, or more specifically, their relationship, and those they are peeping on (as cited in Tania Modleski's excellent book 'The Women Who Knew Too Much'). It goes without saying that Stewart and Kelly are at the top of their game and they're ably provided with some comedic support from Thelma Ritter, adding some of Hitch's typically ghoulish delight to the proceedings.\nAll in all, this remains one of Hitchcock's finest.\n- I hate that he killed the dog though :(\n\nDocument 5: For example, in Mr and Mrs Thorwald, Jeff sees a man who is stuck with an invalid and nagging wife.

We move among it, inhabit it; it’s our beehive, our bird’s nest and so it becomes largely invisible to many of us. And yet, in the cinematic world the opposite seems true. We marvel, we run, we creep with our heroes and villains, through architectural landscapes.\nThink of the wondrous scenes that take place in Hogwarts (Harry Potter 1-8) or the playful ones in the eponymous setting of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Now think of how many times you felt a creeping sense of fear as Danny peddled his trike through the empty corridors of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining, or Captain Dallas squeezing himself along the claustrophobic air ducts of the Nostromo in Alien. Through these few examples it is clear that the surroundings of our characters, as well as their predicaments, help shape our emotional response.\nWes Anderson – Grand Budapest Hotel\nArchitecture also drives plot. In Christopher Nolan’s Inception architecture literally and figuratively divides the characters; the action is split thematically into different maze like structures, or levels, that are built within the plot by an architect: the characters navigate between them, moving forward towards a common goal, some getting lost along the way.\n\nDocument 7: “we all go a little mad sometimes”: alfred hitchcock, american psychoanalysis, and the construction of the cold war psychopath.

Analytical Essay of Rear Window Rear Window is a classic movie, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, about human curiosity, voyeurism and murder.\nThe greatest in this experimental period was, of course, Rear Window. Here, Hitchcock concocted his most original, most challenging concept yet: to create an entire film from one vantage point, the rear window of a Greenwich Village apartment, and in turn, symbolize the very movie-watching.Download\n\nDocument 9: Alfred Hitchcock’s classic film Rear Window (1954), shot almost entirely from one room, focuses largely on what it means to observe and what it means to participate. As observers, we are watching, and as participants, we are engaging. But what happens when watching becomes participation? L.B. Jefferies, a temporarily disabled photographer, uses his apartment’s rear window to gaze into his neighbors’ lives. Jefferies, deriving pleasure from watching others, is a passive voyeur, but we must ask ourselves: are we any different? Watching a film and peeking through a neighbor’s window are both forms of active viewing. Through a clever use of continuous editing and cinematography, Hitchcock shows the audience just how voyeuristic they, like Jefferies, really are.\nAlexander Hubers, ’15\nSponsor: Michelle Mouton\n\nDocument 10: First, before I get into my main topic, I just have to say that this film reminded me that Grace Kelly was one of the most beautiful actresses of her time. Thank you to Alfred Hitchcock for providing such wonder visions of her in “Rear Window”. Now, back to the topic at hand.\nGoing to the movies and watching a film is, at its very heart, a voyeuristic activity. We sit and watch other people’s lives and stories from afar framed by the screen and form opinions and cast judgements on what we are watching. Alfred Hitchcock throws that voyeurism in our faces with “Rear Window”.\n“Rear Window” is a great example of what a master director with a master editor can accomplish. We watch a mostly point-of-view presentation of how a story is created in one’s mind and how that story can infect others that surround a character. We watch as L.B. Jefferies, confined to his wheelchair, becomes involved in the other lives of his neighbors as he voyeuristically watches their lives unfold, framed by the windows of their apartments.\nWe watch “Jeff” as he watches his neighbors and we become consumed by what he is seeing through classic A-B-A editing. A: We see him watching something. B: We cut to see what he is seeing. A: We cut back to get his reaction to what he is seeing. As the Bordwell reading stated, “the Kuleshov effect operates here: Our mind connects the two parts of space”, Jeff’s apartment and the courtyard, without the use of an establishing shot. This sequence of cuts is repeated over and over again to develop the movie-like story of his neighbors where he forms his opinions and casts judgements on what he is seeing and hearing. Given the lack of details, he fills in the gaps by coming to his own conclusions based purely on his visual input from afar. This is the Kuleshov effect on the part of Jeff himself. He connects the dots in his own mind based simply on what he sees and hears while he watches the movie of his neighbors unfold.\nFor me, “Rear Window” was a film of a man watching a movie of his neighbors. Each window in the courtyard presents a screen for us to voyeuristically watch as Jeff also voyeuristically watches his neighbors progress through their everyday lives and, oh yes, commits murder.\n\nDocument 11: in Milton.

Looking at Hollywood classics such as \"Notorious\" and \"Rear Window,\" Winston will illuminate the arc of Hitchcock's brilliant career. A Vermont Humanities Council sponsored event.\n\nDocument 12: North by Northwest was a pre-date James Bond film, it was directed in 1959 while the cold war was going on, it is said to be the best ever Hitchcock film and was nominated for 3 academy awards. One of the most obvious things in the film was the use of different types of camera shots, and visual images to give more meaning to the film and to give a different perspective of things to the viewer. Hitchcock does this by using many different techniques such as different camera shots, shapes, patterns, outfits that the characters wear, and Hitchcock uses a different series of motifs and he puts them to use in very meaningful ways.\nIn the film the use of parallel lines are put to use all the time to give the idea of truth and deception and good and evil. Straight lines are meant to represent the clearness of the situation, for example when Roger Thornhill, the main character, has gone to meet Eve in the woods the viewer isn’t able to see the tree tops which I think is meant to represent that they are enclosed, the trees are also straight up, in this scene Roger Thornhill is told what is going on, or things are made clear to him and also at the end of the film when Roger Thornhill and Eve Kendal are running from Vanddamme’s thugs.\nThe tall straight, truthful trees help to hide the ‘goodies’ from the ‘baddies’. As we cannot see the tops of the trees, a very claustrophobic and enclosed environment is produced. Also, the parallel lines are used in a very different way in the first scene. A high angle shot is used which faces vertically down the sides of tall skyscrapers. These tall buildings have many parallel lines travelling from top to bottom across the building. This suggests that within these buildings are large deceitful and corrupt corporations from which there is no escape, such as the CIA or the UN.\nBendy and twisted lines are meant to show the deception of things that are happening to Thornhill, and things aren’t as clear to him, for example near the beginning of the film when Thornhill has been forced to drink a substantial amount of alcohol and is driving down the road, the road is bendy and you see a point of view camera shot to show what he is seeing and his view is deluded, showing that he doesn’t understand what is going on.\n\nDocument 13: Fincher, more so than a great deal of his contemporaries, uses the opening credits of his features to set the mood and the tone of his story in a highly creative and stimulating style. His incorporation of the technique began in earnest with SE7EN, but the practice hails back to the work of Alfred Hitchchock, who pioneered the idea of opening credits as part of the storytelling and not just an arbitrary device to let the audience know who did what.\nSE7EN is one of the earliest instances in Fincher’s feature filmography in which his aesthetic coalesces into something immediately identifiable—no small feat for a man at bat for only the second time. The film places a subtle, yet strong emphasis on architecture—specifically, an early twentieth-century kind of civic architecture seen in noir films and old New York buildings (a mix of classical and art deco).\nThere’s a distinct claustrophobic feeling to the city David Fincher is portraying, which is reinforced by his framing of several shots from a low angle looking up at the ceiling (implying that the walls are closing in around our characters).\nFincher’s fascination with technology is also reflected in a mix of cutting-edge forensic tools and outdated computer systems that are used by the protagonists to find their man. Lastly, a strong air of nihilism marks Fincher’s filmography, with the incorporation of its philosophy giving SE7EN its pitch-black resonance.\nSeveral story elements, like the moral ambiguity of Detective Mills, the rapid decay of the city aided and abetted by uncaring bureaucrats, and the darkly attractive nature of John Doe’s crimes cause a severe existential crisis for our protagonists.\nSE7EN was a huge hit upon its release, and put David Fincher on the map in a way that ALIEN 3 never did (or could have done)—precisely because it was an original property in which Fincher could assert himself, free from the excessive studio needling that plagued top-dollar franchises back then (and still today).\nThis freedom resulted in one of the most shocking thrillers in recent memory, jolting audiences from apathy and re-energizing a fear response that had been dulled by the onslaught of uninspired slasher films during the 80’s.\n\nDocument 14: I've always loved this bit of mid-century fantasy architecture that Hollywood created for the Alfred Hitchcock thriller \"North by Northwest\" in 1959. When I think of the movie, I think of this wonderful home situated in the Black Hills of South Dakota. I don't know if anything can come any closer to being the epitome of MCM design.The above still needs to be viewed in full screen to be properly appreciated. Look at the concept of blending the structure in with the landscape... the low, long flowing lines... the floating, gravity-defying living area levitated over the canyon drop-off... floor to ceiling windows everywhere... all elements popularized in 50's modern architecture. That's atomic living.\nAs for me? I wouldn't want to live there, as much as I love the scenic Black Hills... but having a good hunk of my home clinging from a drop-off?? That would wear on my acrophobic nerves to no end :P ...Yet it sure is inspiring to admire it's style!\n\nQuestion: How does architecture play a role in creating tension in Hitchcock's Rear Window?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "In Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rear Window,\" architecture plays a pivotal role in shaping the narrative structure and plot development by creating a confined and claustrophobic environment that mirrors the psychological states of the characters and enhances the film's tension. The courtyard's design, with its authentic apartment blocks and the basement-level positioning of Jeff's apartment, serves as a physical and psychological barrier that entraps the characters and the audience, contributing to the film's narrative tension.\n\nThe courtyard's layout, which shelters from sun and wind, paradoxically enhances the feeling of confinement by emphasizing the division between public and private spaces, creating a sense of entrapment that mirrors the characters' experiences. This architectural feature contributes to the claustrophobic atmosphere by intensifying the characters' isolation and the audience's sense of entrapment.\n\nFurthermore, the architecture in \"Rear Window\" shapes the narrative by compartmentalizing characters and plotlines within separate rooms, creating an innate tension that breeds paranoia and perversion. This architectural division serves as a narrative device that drives the plot forward, as characters are trapped in their own spaces, observing and being observed.\n\nThe interplay of natural light from four courtyards throughout the day adds to the tension by constantly changing the visual landscape, making the space feel both intimate and oppressive. This manipulation of light and shadow creates a psychological impact on the characters, as they are constantly aware of their surroundings and the potential for observation or intrusion.\n\nIn conclusion, the architecture in \"Rear Window\" is not merely a backdrop but an integral element that shapes the film's narrative structure and plot development through its physical constraints, visual perspectives, and the psychological impact on characters and viewers alike. The architectural features of the courtyard contribute to the claustrophobic atmosphere by emphasizing physical and psychological entrapment, manipulating light and shadow, and providing a sense of shelter that paradoxically enhances the feeling of confinement. These elements work together to create a tense and oppressive environment that mirrors the characters' experiences and heightens the film's overall tension."}
{"id": 43, "question": "When did Germany become a unified country, and what cultural challenges did this unification bring?", "passages": [{"passage": "Last time, we looked at the historical context for artwork in late nineteenth century Germany. In 1871, Germany officially became a unified country. This time, we’ll look at the cultural ramifications of the unification and how it impacted art.\nAlthough German-speaking princes had been allied for centuries, the individual provinces needed to strengthen their commitment in order to counter military and economic competition from other countries such as Austria and France. But just because the people in the new country spoke German and shared much in the way of their cultural identity didn’t mean that they felt like a big happy family. And the disruptive forces of the industrial revolution did nothing to help the sense of confusion and frustration.\nThe people of the German Empire needed to ask themselves: what does it mean to be German? The imagery on Mettlach steins of the time offers some interesting answers to that question.\nSome steins use inspiration from the distant past for their subject matter. This shows a pride in the traditions of German culture—with roots back to the middle ages—as well as nostalgia for a simpler time. This past is often called “altdeutschen” or “old Germany”. When it appears in art, it is called historicism.\nFor instance, at the beginning of this post is a beautiful stein that shows a medieval knight mounted on a majestic white horse enjoying a tankard of beer. The romantic notion of the past is echoed in the lid in the shape of a castle turret.\nThis large-scale pitcher shows successful German hunters in extravagant Renaissance dress—just look at that ermine trim! The man on this side is toasted by none other than the ancient goddess of the hunt, Diana, who sits on top of a beer barrel.\nA noble couple in elegant dress from the 16th century is featured on this pitcher. The traditions of the past are celebrated by the man who is practicing falconry, using the bird of prey to hunt.\nHistoricism is not the only way that steins reveal the German exploration of identity. National symbolism can be seen in this Mettlach stein. The Imperial Eagle of Germany is front and center.\nThere is further pride in German modernity: This stein celebrates two very important technological developments that Germany embraced: the telegraph and the railroad. The eagle holds telegraph poles with his claws—you can see the glass insulators at the top of the poles with the lines strung between them.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:b64f5fe2-65d3-44d1-beea-344e8b8115a2>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "For much of its varied and interesting history Germany has rarely been one, united country. Instead, over its long past, what is now known as Germany was once states, principalities, kingdoms and more. With its often divided presence, many people tried to unite the country, including Charlemagne of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 9th century, Charlemagne was successful in ruling over a large territory that included modern day Germany, yet it was not strong enough to last and within a single generation, the power of the territory was merely symbolic.\nThe 14th century proved disastrous not only for a fragmented Germany but for all of Europe. Wars and the Black Plague wiped out between 30-60% of the continent’s population. In the 15th century, the Habsburgs were successful in securing a hold on the Holy Roman Emperor which would last into the 19th century. Unfortunately the empire’s various territories were constantly at odds with each other thus preventing the unity that had occurred in France and England.\nThe Reformation, an incredibly important period in European history, was born in Germany when Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses to the town square. Luther hoped to highlight corruption in the Catholic Church and as a result, his desire for change sparked the Reformation that spread quickly across the continent. The next two centuries witnessed the Scientific Revolution and many great thinkers emerged from Germany like Nicholas Copernicus and Johannes Kepler.\nThe 19th century was a time of change for Germany as the desire for unification grew. Tired of several states, each with their own ruler and even currency, much of the population sought nationhood. The March Revolution erupted in 1848 but was ultimately unsuccessful as King Friedrich Wilhelm VI rejected a united nation because it would threaten his power. However, unification was inevitable and occurred more than two decades later in 1871, after the Franco-Prussian war. This unification was ushered in by Otto von Bismarck who helped to maintain peace in Europe until 1914.\nThe First World War was a massive conflict from 1914 to 1918 between the Allies (Britain, France and Russia) and the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary). It resulted in more than 9 million deaths and an incredible amount of destruction.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:caf8df9e-d357-444a-933e-dcb1d5fe75f7>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "On the subject of “sister states,” I begin with a word about Germany, and then turn to the United States.\nOn October 3, Germany celebrated a national holiday called “Day of German Unity” (Tag der Deutschen Einheit). This holiday does not celebrate the founding of the German Empire in 1871 by 25 constituent entities (four kingdoms, five grand duchies, 13 duchies and principalities, and three free Hanseatic cities) under Bismarck. Rather, the day celebrates the merger in 1990 of West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany or FRG), East Germany (formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR), and a united Berlin. The event has been celebrated annually since that day. Specific modes of its celebration rotate among the state capitals.\nI used the word “merger” in a non-technical sense. Three options were possible after the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989:\n• continued separate existence, an option viewed with favor in those quarters of Europe fearful of a return of an economically and militarily powerful united Germany;\n• unification of the two states into a new third state with a new constitution, or\n• the admission into the 11-state FRG of states from the territory of the GDR by means of the new states’ accession to the FRG’s 1949 Constitution (“Basic Law”) as provided by its Article 23.\nThis last option was the path chosen. The GDR had been a unitary form of government, but it was divided into five states for the purposes of accession. Upon accession, Article 23’s provisions on accession by new states were withdrawn — both because their purpose had been fulfilled and to indicate to neighbors that Germany had no designs on other territory.\nThe German constitution of 1949 had established a federal form of government as a remedy against the Nazi abuse of a centralized form of government. I have not confirmed, but we may assume, that Americans, with their experience of a federal form, encouraged this structure and it returned Germany to the federal form it had assumed both under the German Empire (1871-1918) and under the Weimar Republic in 1918. Moreover, Article 23 was included for the eventuality of unification with East Germany — in the form of states. Here, too, the drafters would have drawn upon American experience.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:99e57374-62db-40c8-8323-738f916f002f>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Kohl realized that in order to seize this historic opportunity for Germany, swift action and final determination were crucial. In a cordial meeting between Gorbachev and Chancellor Kohl on July 16, unified Germany’s membership in NATO and its full sovereignty were conceded by the Soviet president.\nThe first concrete step toward unification was the monetary, economic, and social union of West Germany and East Germany on July 1, as had been agreed in May in a treaty between the two German states. The monetary union introduced the deutsche mark into East Germany. Although there had been concern about the GDR’s precarious financial situation, the full extent of the disastrous consequences of forty years of communist rule only came to light in the summer of 1990. It was soon clear that the first massive aid package for the East German economy, comprising DM115 billion, was just the beginning of a long and expensive rebuilding of a country reduced to shambles by the SED.\nDivided by futile discussions about the speed of unification, the new government coalition in East Berlin had begun to fall apart during July 1990, when its SPD members resigned. Persuaded by the mounting economic and social problems that unification was necessary, the Volkskammer finally agreed on October 3, 1990, as the date of German unification.\nOn the occasion of the first free elections in the GDR, Chancellor Kohl took the opportunity to publicly express his gratitude to the United States, which had been Germany’s most reliable ally during the process of unification. Once the first prerequisite for future unification had been established, namely, the willingness of Gorbachev to consider negotiations on unification in light of the dramatic events of the fall of 1989, the consent of the other victorious powers had to be secured.\nStatements voicing concerns and even fears of a reemergence of an aggressive unified Germany suddenly appeared in the international press and media, as well as in unofficial remarks made by political figures throughout Europe. Even the FRG’s major NATO partners in Europe–Britain and France–had become rather comfortable with the prevailing situation, that is, being allied with an economically potent, but politically weak, semisovereign West Germany.\nAlthough lip service in support of future unification of Germany was common in the postwar era, no one dreamed of its eventual realization.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:17c721ec-9d28-42cb-a12c-3c87dc11f823>::chunk-133"]}, {"passage": "Particularly notable are the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, after which Italy gained Venetia, and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, which finally unified Italy with the gain of the Papal States and Rome. This final war also brought about the downfall of Napoleon’s nephew, Louis Napoleon or Napoleon III, as well as the unification of Germany. Unlike Italy, the German struggle for unity did not attract the same intense identifications and passionate romanticised zeal as the Risorgimento, perhaps because Germany was taken more seriously as an economic, modernized nation with stronger military and diplomatic power. As Maura O’Connor points out, the different fates of Germany and Italy in the nineteenth century illustrates the unevenness of economic and political change.\nUnification of Italy, and its freedom from foreign occupiers, was achieved in 1861 through the military intervention of Napoleon’s nephew, Napoleon III, together with King Victor Emanuel of Sardinia (Piedmont), who became King of a united Italy through a series of plebiscites (Venice and Rome were not incorporated into the Kingdom until 1866 and 1870 respectively). But unification was both a cultural movement as well as a political phenomenon, and the example of Napoleon’s coronation demonstrates the fraught relationship between culture and politics. In addition, Napoleon’s adoption of the kingship of France underlines another key problematic at the heart of the concept of “Italy”: a belief in Italy as a national entity did not necessarily directly correspond with a movement to free the land from foreign rule. Furthermore, those advocating for political independence did not necessarily want unity; as Martin Clark points out, for many Italian writers and intellectuals, Italy’s diversity meant that “a single Italian state seemed [. . .] . . . not only impossible but also undesirable” (4). Those more inclined towards any kind of national unity favoured federalism (4). But, although unification, liberty and independence—the attested trio of Risorgimento goals—were largely achieved in 1861, this still did not equate to creating Italy as a nation.

What were the factors responsible for the rapid industrialisation Germany after 1870? How did the industrialisation process of Germany differ from that of Britain? [20 Marks]\nThe Industrial Revolution began about a century later in Germany than it did in England. Before 1870 Germany was not united properly. This was because of the power struggle, mainly between Prussia and Austria, that was occurring at the time. This disunity did not provide for a stable or flourishing economy.\nFactors responsible for the rapid industrialisation of Germany after 1870\n- Unification of Germany:\n- In 1871 finally a united Germany was formed under the chancellor of Germany, Bismarck, which united the divided states together.\n- A new united country meant that goods, natural resources could be distributed among all of Germany faster than before. Business thrived because of the unification.\n- A unified country meant that it was coordinated in its actions, and therefore was less vulnerable to political, social and military attacks which lowered costs and risks associated with owning a business.\n- Government’s Role, Protection and Welfare:\n- Government supported not only heavy industry but also crafts and trades.\n- In 1879 industrial protection was introduced by applying the foreign tariffs on imports. This encouraged trade, employment, and business.\n- Government accumulated a lot of money from tariffs imposed on foreign items, which allowed her to put money back into the economy and to introduce social welfares such as Health Insurance, Accident Insurance and Old Age Pension.\n- Social Welfare was also introduced (First time by Bismark) made people think twice about how bad the government was, and deterred people from swinging toward the communist side of the political spectrum. Also these deterred migration of skilled Germans to other countries like the USA.\n- Contribution of Bismarck:\n- Firstly, he unified the country; secondly, he brought the economy into line; thirdly, he made sure it stayed that way and encouraged it; and fourthly, he prevented anything from hurting the economy badly.\n- Bismarck won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade\n- Even before unification, his Blood and iron Policy included Iron (which fuelled Industrialization).", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:8a4a6db7-d759-45f4-9eab-4f1a53233810>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "How long until German Unity Day ?\n|This holiday next takes place in 343 Days.|\n|Tag der Deutschen Einheit|\nDates of German Unity Day\nThis national holiday is always celebrated on 3 October.

Since the end of World War II, the number of youths entering universities has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools of the Federal Republic of Germany (F.R.G.) are among the world’s best. Germany is a broadly middle class society. A generous social welfare system provides for universal medical care, unemployment compensation, and other social needs. Millions of Germans travel abroad each year.\nWith unification on October 3, 1990, Germany began the major task of bringing the standard of living of Germans in the former German Democratic Republic (G.D.R.) up to that of western Germany. This has been a lengthy and difficult process due to the relative inefficiency of industrial enterprises in the former G.D.R., difficulties in resolving property ownership in eastern Germany, and the inadequate infrastructure and environmental damage that resulted from years of mismanagement under communist rule.\nEconomic uncertainty in eastern Germany is often cited as one factor contributing to extremist violence, primarily from the political right. Confusion about the causes of the current hardships and a need to place blame has found expression in harassment and violence by some Germans directed toward foreigners, particularly non-Europeans. The vast majority of Germans condemn such violence.\nTwo of Germany’s most famous writers, Goethe and Schiller, identified the central aspect of most of Germany’s history with their poetic lament, “Germany? But where is it? I cannot find that country.” Until 1871, there was no “Germany.” Instead, Europe’s German-speaking territories were divided into several hundred kingdoms, principalities, duchies, bishoprics, fiefdoms and independent cities and towns.\nFinding the answer to “the German question”–what form of statehood for the German speaking lands would arise, and which form could provide central Europe with peace and stability–has defined most of German history. This history of many independent polities has found continuity in the F.R.G.’s federal structure. It is also the basis for the decentralized nature of German political, economic, and cultural life that lasts to this day.\nThe Holy Roman Empire\nBetween 962 and the beginning of the 19th Century, the German territories were loosely organized into the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:b4b52e14-7cd1-48b0-b7a2-9c2c8a96c9c8>::chunk-2"]}, {"passage": "- The Nazi Temple of Pomerania: Exploring the Mysterious Odry Stone Circles\n- Ahnenerbe: Nazis and the Search for Relics\n- Unearthed Brooch Tells of the Nazis’ Abuse of Ancient Norse Runes to Spread Their Dark Ideology\nThe classical answers refer to historical, economic, and social reasons such as the crisis in which Germany was struggling immediately after the First World War, forced by the Treaty of Versailles (signed on June 28, 1919) to live in a chasm of hunger and misery due to the debts of war that were impossible to pay and with an army reduced to a tiny symbolic unit.

The Holy Roman Empire, the 1st (German) Reich, officially began on December 5, 800, when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Despite the high-flown name, it was not able to keep Central Europe united and throughout the course of the Middle Ages, until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars , the heart of the Empire, Germany, remained fundamentally divided into many small regions ruled by local lords always at war for dominance.\n‘Imperial Coronation of Charlemagne,’ by Friedrich Kaulbach, 1861.

In 1871, Germany officially became a unified country. This time, we’ll look at the cultural ramifications of the unification and how it impacted art.\nAlthough German-speaking princes had been allied for centuries, the individual provinces needed to strengthen their commitment in order to counter military and economic competition from other countries such as Austria and France. But just because the people in the new country spoke German and shared much in the way of their cultural identity didn’t mean that they felt like a big happy family. And the disruptive forces of the industrial revolution did nothing to help the sense of confusion and frustration.\nThe people of the German Empire needed to ask themselves: what does it mean to be German? The imagery on Mettlach steins of the time offers some interesting answers to that question.\nSome steins use inspiration from the distant past for their subject matter. This shows a pride in the traditions of German culture—with roots back to the middle ages—as well as nostalgia for a simpler time. This past is often called “altdeutschen” or “old Germany”. When it appears in art, it is called historicism.\nFor instance, at the beginning of this post is a beautiful stein that shows a medieval knight mounted on a majestic white horse enjoying a tankard of beer. The romantic notion of the past is echoed in the lid in the shape of a castle turret.\nThis large-scale pitcher shows successful German hunters in extravagant Renaissance dress—just look at that ermine trim! The man on this side is toasted by none other than the ancient goddess of the hunt, Diana, who sits on top of a beer barrel.\nA noble couple in elegant dress from the 16th century is featured on this pitcher. The traditions of the past are celebrated by the man who is practicing falconry, using the bird of prey to hunt.\nHistoricism is not the only way that steins reveal the German exploration of identity. National symbolism can be seen in this Mettlach stein. The Imperial Eagle of Germany is front and center.\nThere is further pride in German modernity: This stein celebrates two very important technological developments that Germany embraced: the telegraph and the railroad. The eagle holds telegraph poles with his claws—you can see the glass insulators at the top of the poles with the lines strung between them.\n\nDocument 2: For much of its varied and interesting history Germany has rarely been one, united country. Instead, over its long past, what is now known as Germany was once states, principalities, kingdoms and more. With its often divided presence, many people tried to unite the country, including Charlemagne of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 9th century, Charlemagne was successful in ruling over a large territory that included modern day Germany, yet it was not strong enough to last and within a single generation, the power of the territory was merely symbolic.\nThe 14th century proved disastrous not only for a fragmented Germany but for all of Europe. Wars and the Black Plague wiped out between 30-60% of the continent’s population. In the 15th century, the Habsburgs were successful in securing a hold on the Holy Roman Emperor which would last into the 19th century. Unfortunately the empire’s various territories were constantly at odds with each other thus preventing the unity that had occurred in France and England.\nThe Reformation, an incredibly important period in European history, was born in Germany when Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses to the town square. Luther hoped to highlight corruption in the Catholic Church and as a result, his desire for change sparked the Reformation that spread quickly across the continent. The next two centuries witnessed the Scientific Revolution and many great thinkers emerged from Germany like Nicholas Copernicus and Johannes Kepler.\nThe 19th century was a time of change for Germany as the desire for unification grew. Tired of several states, each with their own ruler and even currency, much of the population sought nationhood. The March Revolution erupted in 1848 but was ultimately unsuccessful as King Friedrich Wilhelm VI rejected a united nation because it would threaten his power. However, unification was inevitable and occurred more than two decades later in 1871, after the Franco-Prussian war. This unification was ushered in by Otto von Bismarck who helped to maintain peace in Europe until 1914.\nThe First World War was a massive conflict from 1914 to 1918 between the Allies (Britain, France and Russia) and the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary). It resulted in more than 9 million deaths and an incredible amount of destruction.\n\nDocument 3: Kohl realized that in order to seize this historic opportunity for Germany, swift action and final determination were crucial. In a cordial meeting between Gorbachev and Chancellor Kohl on July 16, unified Germany’s membership in NATO and its full sovereignty were conceded by the Soviet president.\nThe first concrete step toward unification was the monetary, economic, and social union of West Germany and East Germany on July 1, as had been agreed in May in a treaty between the two German states. The monetary union introduced the deutsche mark into East Germany. Although there had been concern about the GDR’s precarious financial situation, the full extent of the disastrous consequences of forty years of communist rule only came to light in the summer of 1990. It was soon clear that the first massive aid package for the East German economy, comprising DM115 billion, was just the beginning of a long and expensive rebuilding of a country reduced to shambles by the SED.\nDivided by futile discussions about the speed of unification, the new government coalition in East Berlin had begun to fall apart during July 1990, when its SPD members resigned. Persuaded by the mounting economic and social problems that unification was necessary, the Volkskammer finally agreed on October 3, 1990, as the date of German unification.\nOn the occasion of the first free elections in the GDR, Chancellor Kohl took the opportunity to publicly express his gratitude to the United States, which had been Germany’s most reliable ally during the process of unification. Once the first prerequisite for future unification had been established, namely, the willingness of Gorbachev to consider negotiations on unification in light of the dramatic events of the fall of 1989, the consent of the other victorious powers had to be secured.\nStatements voicing concerns and even fears of a reemergence of an aggressive unified Germany suddenly appeared in the international press and media, as well as in unofficial remarks made by political figures throughout Europe. Even the FRG’s major NATO partners in Europe–Britain and France–had become rather comfortable with the prevailing situation, that is, being allied with an economically potent, but politically weak, semisovereign West Germany.\nAlthough lip service in support of future unification of Germany was common in the postwar era, no one dreamed of its eventual realization.\n\nDocument 4: Particularly notable are the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, after which Italy gained Venetia, and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871, which finally unified Italy with the gain of the Papal States and Rome. This final war also brought about the downfall of Napoleon’s nephew, Louis Napoleon or Napoleon III, as well as the unification of Germany. Unlike Italy, the German struggle for unity did not attract the same intense identifications and passionate romanticised zeal as the Risorgimento, perhaps because Germany was taken more seriously as an economic, modernized nation with stronger military and diplomatic power. As Maura O’Connor points out, the different fates of Germany and Italy in the nineteenth century illustrates the unevenness of economic and political change.\nUnification of Italy, and its freedom from foreign occupiers, was achieved in 1861 through the military intervention of Napoleon’s nephew, Napoleon III, together with King Victor Emanuel of Sardinia (Piedmont), who became King of a united Italy through a series of plebiscites (Venice and Rome were not incorporated into the Kingdom until 1866 and 1870 respectively). But unification was both a cultural movement as well as a political phenomenon, and the example of Napoleon’s coronation demonstrates the fraught relationship between culture and politics. In addition, Napoleon’s adoption of the kingship of France underlines another key problematic at the heart of the concept of “Italy”: a belief in Italy as a national entity did not necessarily directly correspond with a movement to free the land from foreign rule. Furthermore, those advocating for political independence did not necessarily want unity; as Martin Clark points out, for many Italian writers and intellectuals, Italy’s diversity meant that “a single Italian state seemed [. . .] . . . not only impossible but also undesirable” (4). Those more inclined towards any kind of national unity favoured federalism (4). But, although unification, liberty and independence—the attested trio of Risorgimento goals—were largely achieved in 1861, this still did not equate to creating Italy as a nation. As Clark observes, “If Italian identity is multiple now, it was even more multiple then” (8).\n\nDocument 5: On the subject of “sister states,” I begin with a word about Germany, and then turn to the United States.\nOn October 3, Germany celebrated a national holiday called “Day of German Unity” (Tag der Deutschen Einheit). This holiday does not celebrate the founding of the German Empire in 1871 by 25 constituent entities (four kingdoms, five grand duchies, 13 duchies and principalities, and three free Hanseatic cities) under Bismarck. Rather, the day celebrates the merger in 1990 of West Germany (Federal Republic of Germany or FRG), East Germany (formally the German Democratic Republic or GDR), and a united Berlin. The event has been celebrated annually since that day. Specific modes of its celebration rotate among the state capitals.\nI used the word “merger” in a non-technical sense. Three options were possible after the fall of the Berlin Wall on November 9, 1989:\n• continued separate existence, an option viewed with favor in those quarters of Europe fearful of a return of an economically and militarily powerful united Germany;\n• unification of the two states into a new third state with a new constitution, or\n• the admission into the 11-state FRG of states from the territory of the GDR by means of the new states’ accession to the FRG’s 1949 Constitution (“Basic Law”) as provided by its Article 23.\nThis last option was the path chosen. The GDR had been a unitary form of government, but it was divided into five states for the purposes of accession. Upon accession, Article 23’s provisions on accession by new states were withdrawn — both because their purpose had been fulfilled and to indicate to neighbors that Germany had no designs on other territory.\nThe German constitution of 1949 had established a federal form of government as a remedy against the Nazi abuse of a centralized form of government. I have not confirmed, but we may assume, that Americans, with their experience of a federal form, encouraged this structure and it returned Germany to the federal form it had assumed both under the German Empire (1871-1918) and under the Weimar Republic in 1918. Moreover, Article 23 was included for the eventuality of unification with East Germany — in the form of states. Here, too, the drafters would have drawn upon American experience.\n\nDocument 6: Solution: Daily Problem Practice [World History: Week 16]- 29 January\nQ. What were the factors responsible for the rapid industrialisation Germany after 1870? How did the industrialisation process of Germany differ from that of Britain? [20 Marks]\nThe Industrial Revolution began about a century later in Germany than it did in England. Before 1870 Germany was not united properly. This was because of the power struggle, mainly between Prussia and Austria, that was occurring at the time. This disunity did not provide for a stable or flourishing economy.\nFactors responsible for the rapid industrialisation of Germany after 1870\n- Unification of Germany:\n- In 1871 finally a united Germany was formed under the chancellor of Germany, Bismarck, which united the divided states together.\n- A new united country meant that goods, natural resources could be distributed among all of Germany faster than before. Business thrived because of the unification.\n- A unified country meant that it was coordinated in its actions, and therefore was less vulnerable to political, social and military attacks which lowered costs and risks associated with owning a business.\n- Government’s Role, Protection and Welfare:\n- Government supported not only heavy industry but also crafts and trades.\n- In 1879 industrial protection was introduced by applying the foreign tariffs on imports. This encouraged trade, employment, and business.\n- Government accumulated a lot of money from tariffs imposed on foreign items, which allowed her to put money back into the economy and to introduce social welfares such as Health Insurance, Accident Insurance and Old Age Pension.\n- Social Welfare was also introduced (First time by Bismark) made people think twice about how bad the government was, and deterred people from swinging toward the communist side of the political spectrum. Also these deterred migration of skilled Germans to other countries like the USA.\n- Contribution of Bismarck:\n- Firstly, he unified the country; secondly, he brought the economy into line; thirdly, he made sure it stayed that way and encouraged it; and fourthly, he prevented anything from hurting the economy badly.\n- Bismarck won the support of both industry and skilled workers by his high tariff policies, which protected profits and wages from American competition, although they alienated the liberal intellectuals who wanted free trade\n- Even before unification, his Blood and iron Policy included Iron (which fuelled Industrialization).\n\nDocument 7: How long until German Unity Day ?\n|This holiday next takes place in 343 Days.|\n|Tag der Deutschen Einheit|\nDates of German Unity Day\nThis national holiday is always celebrated on 3 October. If 3 October falls on a weekend, it will not be moved to a weekday.\nSince 1990, the 'Tag der Deutschen Einheit' has been a national holiday in Germany. It is the only official national holiday. All other holidays are managed at a federal level.\nThe reunification of Germany took place on 3 October 1990, when the former German Democratic Republic (GDR) was incorporated into the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG).\nFollowing the GDR's first free elections on 18 March 1990, negotiations between the GDR and FRG culminated in a Unification Treaty.\nFurther negotiations between the GDR and FRG and the four occupying powers produced the so-called \"Two Plus Four Treaty\" granting full sovereignty to a unified German state, whose two halves had previously been bound by a number of limitations as a result of its post-WWII-status as an occupied nation.\nThe German Unification Day has been celebrated in the capital of whichever federal state has got the chair in the Federal Assembly (there are 16 federal states in Germany).\nGerman Unification Day wasn't added as an additional holiday. In the west, it replaced the original Day of German Unity, which an anniversary of a protest on 17 June 1953 in East Germany.\nIn East Germany, the national holiday was 7 October, the Day of the Republic (Tag der Republik), which commemorated the foundation of the GDR in 1949.\n\nDocument 8: Fighting for the Soul of Germany –\nThe Catholic Struggle for Inclusion After Unification\nBy Rebecca Ayako Bennette\nHarvard University Press – £36.95\nWhile reasserting what many people already know about religiosity within Germany, Catholicism in particular, this book asks us to re-think about the country’s national identity, especially towards the end of the nineteenth-century. A questionably volatile, if not complex period in said country’s history to say the least.\nTo be sure, Rebecca Ayako Bennette – who is Asisstant Professor of History at Middlebury College – has herein written a book that sheds new light on what many believed was theologicaly, already set in stone. As is boldly noted on the inside sleeve of Fighting for the Soul of Germany – The Catholic Struggle for Inclusion After Unification: ”Historians have long believed that Catholics were late and ambivalent supporters of the German nation […]. In the years following unification, Germany was embroiled in a struggle to define the new nation. Otto von Bismarck and his allies looked to establish Germany as a modern nation through emphasis on Protestantism and military prowess. Many Catholics feared for their future when he launched the Kulturkampf, a program to break the political and social power of German Catholicism. But these anti-Catholic policies did not destroy Catholic hopes for the new Germany.”\nIndeed, they did not.\nAs these nine chapters emphatically demonstrate, Catholic hopes were to become embroiled, then entrenched, and eventually enhanced by way of a ”feminine alternative” to that of Bismarckian militarism. Although not before an initial stasis of its own rhetorical design, with the emphasis on rhetorical design. Reason being, so many segments of German, Catholic society, were consumed by consistent paranoias invariably reported and promoted in the country’s then media: ”Newspapers were a widespread medium in which Catholic notables could articulate their view of the German nation, reaching far more individuals than, for example, any address in parliament or speech at an associated meeting […]. Catholics both encountered and constructed ”their” vision of Germany on a daily basis in the newspapers.”\nAnd like any association of newspapers, there is always going to be an undercurrent of (sometimes warped) opinion; whereby words and rhetoric are carefully, and quite often, very subliminally chosen.\n\nDocument 9: Historical features of germany steps toward unification step #4a: ems dispatch : catalyst for war 1868 revolt in spain.

Since the end of World War II, the number of youths entering universities has more than tripled, and the trade and technical schools of the Federal Republic of Germany (F.R.G.) are among the world’s best. Germany is a broadly middle class society. A generous social welfare system provides for universal medical care, unemployment compensation, and other social needs. Millions of Germans travel abroad each year.\nWith unification on October 3, 1990, Germany began the major task of bringing the standard of living of Germans in the former German Democratic Republic (G.D.R.) up to that of western Germany. This has been a lengthy and difficult process due to the relative inefficiency of industrial enterprises in the former G.D.R., difficulties in resolving property ownership in eastern Germany, and the inadequate infrastructure and environmental damage that resulted from years of mismanagement under communist rule.\nEconomic uncertainty in eastern Germany is often cited as one factor contributing to extremist violence, primarily from the political right. Confusion about the causes of the current hardships and a need to place blame has found expression in harassment and violence by some Germans directed toward foreigners, particularly non-Europeans. The vast majority of Germans condemn such violence.\nTwo of Germany’s most famous writers, Goethe and Schiller, identified the central aspect of most of Germany’s history with their poetic lament, “Germany? But where is it? I cannot find that country.” Until 1871, there was no “Germany.” Instead, Europe’s German-speaking territories were divided into several hundred kingdoms, principalities, duchies, bishoprics, fiefdoms and independent cities and towns.\nFinding the answer to “the German question”–what form of statehood for the German speaking lands would arise, and which form could provide central Europe with peace and stability–has defined most of German history. This history of many independent polities has found continuity in the F.R.G.’s federal structure. It is also the basis for the decentralized nature of German political, economic, and cultural life that lasts to this day.\nThe Holy Roman Empire\nBetween 962 and the beginning of the 19th Century, the German territories were loosely organized into the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation.\n\nDocument 11: - The Nazi Temple of Pomerania: Exploring the Mysterious Odry Stone Circles\n- Ahnenerbe: Nazis and the Search for Relics\n- Unearthed Brooch Tells of the Nazis’ Abuse of Ancient Norse Runes to Spread Their Dark Ideology\nThe classical answers refer to historical, economic, and social reasons such as the crisis in which Germany was struggling immediately after the First World War, forced by the Treaty of Versailles (signed on June 28, 1919) to live in a chasm of hunger and misery due to the debts of war that were impossible to pay and with an army reduced to a tiny symbolic unit. But there is another answer, a most important one, suggested in the years leading up to Hitler by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung, who studied the Germanic psychic substratum and National Socialism in-depth, and considered a mass psychic epidemic.\nHis exceptionally advanced conclusions are aligned with the latest specialist studies of historians such as Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, Giorgio Galli, etc. - academics who have brought to light the behind-the-scenes core that generated every decision of the Third Reich and their ideology with causes stemming from a very particular political and social situation.\nA Fragmented History: A Nation in Pieces\nIn the case of Germany, the political division is always closely linked to the psychological and social one. The Holy Roman Empire, the 1st (German) Reich, officially began on December 5, 800, when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. Despite the high-flown name, it was not able to keep Central Europe united and throughout the course of the Middle Ages, until its dissolution in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars , the heart of the Empire, Germany, remained fundamentally divided into many small regions ruled by local lords always at war for dominance.\n‘Imperial Coronation of Charlemagne,’ by Friedrich Kaulbach, 1861. ( Public Domain )\nIn time the unfulfilled search for unity caused strong emotional, social, and political tension. It intensified in the years 1848-1870 and brought with it, in the wake of Romanticism and the fervor of the most intense emotions, a growing opposition to the modern industrialized world. This was felt as a strong obstacle to German unity.\n\nDocument 12: When did Germany become a Protestant country?\nThe religion of Protestantism, a form of Christianity, was founded within Germany in the 16th Century Reformation. It was formed as a new direction from some Roman Catholic principles, led initially by Martin Luther, later by John Calvin.\nWas Martin Luther German Protestant?\nMartin Luther, (born November 10, 1483, Eisleben, Saxony [Germany]—died February 18, 1546, Eisleben), German theologian and religious reformer who was the catalyst of the 16th-century Protestant Reformation.\nWhich German states became Protestant?\nThe Holy Roman Empire became religiously diverse; for the most part, the states of northern and central Germany became Protestant (chiefly Lutheran, but also Calvinist/Reformed) while the states of southern Germany and the Rhineland largely remained Catholic.\nWhy did the Protestant Reformation start in Germany?\nThere were two primary factors that led to the Reformation occurring in Germany. These were the invention of the printing press by Gutenberg in 1440 and the political organization of the German States as members of the Holy Roman Empire when Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to the church door in 1517.\nWhy are Germanic countries Protestant?\nProtestantism started in Germany so to all German speakers there was much less of a language barrier (though some areas of Germany had a later reformation, i.e. Westphalia, since they were originally not able to understand Luther’s translation) and less of a cultural barrier.\nIs France Catholic or Protestant?\n|Religious group||Population % 1986||Population % 2010|\n|–Other and unaffiliated Christians||–||–|\nWas John Calvin a Protestant?\nJohn Calvin, French Jean Calvin or Jean Cauvin, (born July 10, 1509, Noyon, Picardy, France—died May 27, 1564, Geneva, Switzerland), theologian and ecclesiastical statesman. He was the leading French Protestant reformer and the most important figure in the second generation of the Protestant Reformation.\nWho started the Protestant church?\nMartin Luther, a German teacher and a monk, brought about the Protestant Reformation when he challenged the Catholic Church’s teachings starting in 1517. The Protestant Reformation was a religious reform movement that swept through Europe in the 1500s.\nWho fought against Catholic Church?\n\nDocument 13: 1. According to the website, what is Nationalism? Nationalism is loyalty to the idea of the state rather than to the community. 2. What is the difference between Nationalism and Patriotism? Patriotism is a love of one’s country that inspires one to serve for the benefit of its citizens. Nationalism is also a love of one’s country, but with the belief that the country is superior to other countries. 3. What was the Romantic Movement and how did it enhance nationalist feelings? The Romantic Movement provided a set of cultural myths and folks traditions that set nations apart.\n4. Use the information on only the initial page to briefly describe the impact of nationalism in each of the four countries during the mid-late 1800s: *France- France strove to solidify its own identity as a nation as its territory diminished. *Germany- They wanted to create a German state as much in opposition to Austria as in the interests of national unity. *Italy- Fought to reunify disparate Italian forces, after they were subjugated by French and Austrian leaders. *Russia- Tsar Alexander the 2nd began working on making Russia a modern nation, although other groups bordering Russia faced problems in making their own nations\nThe questions below are more in-depth, dealing with the unification of Italy and Germany. Use the links on the right of the page to help you answer the following questions.\n5. On a separate sheet of paper, make a chronological timeline of the important events leading up to the unification of Italy 6. What term do historians use to identify the reunification of Italy? 7. In a well-constructed paragraph, identify each of the following people and the role each played in Italian unification: *Mazzini\nRead excerpts from “General Instructions for the Members of Young Italy” and answer the following questions:\n8. Summarize, in a well-constructed sentence, what Mazzini was trying to say to the members of Young Italy.\n9. What are two phrases/terms that show nationalist feelings? a. She has suffient strength in herself to become one. b. Italy is destined to become one nation.\n10. What was the goal of “Young Italy” according to the document? Unite all Italian citizens. 11. What challenges did Italians have to overcome in order to unite Italy as one nation-state?\n\nQuestion: When did Germany become a unified country, and what cultural challenges did this unification bring?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Germany became a unified country in 1871, following the Franco-Prussian War, under the leadership of Otto von Bismarck. This unification, known as the German Empire, was a pivotal moment that brought together disparate German-speaking regions under one state. The cultural challenges brought by this unification were significant, as Germans grappled with defining a unified national identity amidst a rich tapestry of regional cultures and histories.\n\nThe unification process was not just a political consolidation but also a cultural endeavor to forge a cohesive national identity. This endeavor was complicated by the industrial revolution, which exacerbated feelings of confusion and frustration among Germans, prompting them to question their identity. The imagery on Mettlach steins, often drawing on \"altdeutschen\" or \"old Germany\" themes, reflects a nostalgia for a simpler past and a desire to define what it meant to be German.\n\nKey figures like Otto von Bismarck played a crucial role in this unification. Bismarck's masterful abilities, combined with strategic timing and luck, allowed him to unite the German-speaking peoples under a banner that would later have profound global implications. His efforts were instrumental in transforming Germany into a formidable power, capable of competing with other major countries.\n\nThe historical context of Germany's division into various states, principalities, and kingdoms further emphasized the long-standing fragmentation of the region. The unification process involved not only the merger of West and East Germany but also the careful navigation of international relations and the delicate balance of maintaining peace and stability.\n\nIn summary, the unification of Germany in 1871 was a pivotal moment that brought together disparate German-speaking regions under one state, but it also presented significant cultural challenges as Germans grappled with defining a unified national identity amidst a rich tapestry of regional cultures and histories. This process was significantly influenced by key figures like Otto von Bismarck, whose efforts transformed Germany into a powerful nation. The cultural introspection and identity struggles that emerged during this period continue to shape Germany's role in Europe and the world."}

The rise in the production of manuscripts in Lyons at the beginning of the 16th century is paralleled most notably with the appearance of a printing press there in 1473. Commerce in Lyons also flourished with the arrival of the French court during the Italian Wars in 1494, which made Lyons the second center of the Kingdom of France and a veritable hub for commercial and artistic exchange.\nMore than thirty illuminated manuscripts are now recognized as the work of the Master of the Entry of Francis I. In addition to fifteen Books of Hours, including a luxurious example for Philibert de Vitry (Geneva, BPU, MS Lat. 367), the artist is credited with ten office books, which include a Missal for the church of the Order of Saint John of Rhodes illuminated for Charles Aleman de la Rochechenard, called the Rhodes Missal (London, Museum of the Order of Saint John); a Missal for the Abbey of Saint-Claude in Jura (Paris, Assemblée national, MS 10); the Pontifical of Bishop Louis Guillard d'Épichelière, almoner to Francis I (Paris, BnF, MS Lat. 955), and a Benedictional-Evangeliary for the use of Saint-Nizier of Lyons (Lyon, BM, MS 5136). The Master of the Entry of Francis I also decorated numerous instructive, literary, and historical works, including a Kalender of Shepherds (Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, MS 167), a Trésor de sapience (Chantilly, Musée Condé, MS 147), and the Pas d'armes de Sandricourt (Paris, BnF, Arsenal, MS 3958)\nThe color palette and the execution of the classically-inspired architectural frames that surround the textual incipits and accompany the miniatures reveal the artist's training in the workshop of the Master of Alarmes de Mars, active in Lyons from the 1480s until the early 1510s.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:82c7117c-d154-4dfa-ab70-d2db9d826be8>::chunk-6"]}, {"passage": "Lyon is a city in east central France.

His first public commissions came early in the 1860s, with work at the Musée de Picardie at Amiens. The first four works were Concordia (1861), Bellum (1861), Le Travail(1863) and Le Repos (Rest)(1863).\nPuvis received a substantial number of commissions for works to be carried out in public and private institutions throughout France. His early work at the Musée de Picardie had helped him to develop his classicizing style, and the decorative aesthetic of his mural works.

Royalists felt that the revolution of 1789 had been an immense disaster and that France had been thrown off course, while the Republicans felt that the Revolution had allowed France to revert to its true course. Consequently, works that were to be displayed in public spaces, such as murals, had the important task of fulfilling the ideology of the commissioning party.

One of them, the Sorbonne, became a fountainhead of theological learning with Albertus Magnus and St. Thomas Aquinas among its scholars. The university community constituted an autonomous borough; another was formed on the right bank by merchants ruled by their own provost.

New York was undoubtedly the most important place for art and other sectors, but I was afraid of settling in an market-like place.

The rise in the production of manuscripts in Lyons at the beginning of the 16th century is paralleled most notably with the appearance of a printing press there in 1473. Commerce in Lyons also flourished with the arrival of the French court during the Italian Wars in 1494, which made Lyons the second center of the Kingdom of France and a veritable hub for commercial and artistic exchange.\nMore than thirty illuminated manuscripts are now recognized as the work of the Master of the Entry of Francis I. In addition to fifteen Books of Hours, including a luxurious example for Philibert de Vitry (Geneva, BPU, MS Lat. 367), the artist is credited with ten office books, which include a Missal for the church of the Order of Saint John of Rhodes illuminated for Charles Aleman de la Rochechenard, called the Rhodes Missal (London, Museum of the Order of Saint John); a Missal for the Abbey of Saint-Claude in Jura (Paris, Assemblée national, MS 10); the Pontifical of Bishop Louis Guillard d'Épichelière, almoner to Francis I (Paris, BnF, MS Lat. 955), and a Benedictional-Evangeliary for the use of Saint-Nizier of Lyons (Lyon, BM, MS 5136). The Master of the Entry of Francis I also decorated numerous instructive, literary, and historical works, including a Kalender of Shepherds (Cambridge, Fitzwilliam Museum, MS 167), a Trésor de sapience (Chantilly, Musée Condé, MS 147), and the Pas d'armes de Sandricourt (Paris, BnF, Arsenal, MS 3958)\nThe color palette and the execution of the classically-inspired architectural frames that surround the textual incipits and accompany the miniatures reveal the artist's training in the workshop of the Master of Alarmes de Mars, active in Lyons from the 1480s until the early 1510s.\n\nDocument 2: One of his protégés was Georges de Feure.\nPuvis de Chavannes is best known for his mural painting, and he came to be known as “the painter for France,” despite his present relative obscurity. His first commission was for his brother’s chateau, Le Brouchy, which is a medieval-style structure near Cuiseaux in Saône-et-Loire. The principal decorations take the four seasons as their theme. His first public commissions came early in the 1860s, with work at the Musée de Picardie at Amiens. The first four works were Concordia (1861), Bellum (1861), Le Travail(1863) and Le Repos (Rest)(1863).\nPuvis received a substantial number of commissions for works to be carried out in public and private institutions throughout France. His early work at the Musée de Picardie had helped him to develop his classicizing style, and the decorative aesthetic of his mural works. Among his public works are the later cycles completed at Amiens (Ave Picardia Nutrix, 1865), at Marseille, at Lyon and at Poitiers. Of particular importance is the cycle at the Palais de Beaux Arts in Lyon, which includes three significant works filling the main staircase well. The works are Antique Vision 1884, The Wood Dear to the Arts and the Muses 1884, and Christian Inspiration 1884.\nParis Puvis’s career was tied up with a complicated debate that had been ongoing since the beginning of the 3rd Republic (1870), and at the end of the violence of the Paris Commune. The question at stake was the identity of France and the meaning of ‘Frenchness’. Royalists felt that the revolution of 1789 had been an immense disaster and that France had been thrown off course, while the Republicans felt that the Revolution had allowed France to revert to its true course. Consequently, works that were to be displayed in public spaces, such as murals, had the important task of fulfilling the ideology of the commissioning party. Many scholars of Puvis’s works have noted that his success as a ‘painter for France’ was largely due to his ability to create works that were agreeable to the many ideologies in existence at this time.\n\nDocument 3: Lyon(redirected from Lyons, Archdiocese of)\nAlso found in: Thesaurus, Medical, Financial, Encyclopedia.\nLy·onor Ly·ons (lē-ōN′, lyôN)\nA city of east-central France at the confluence of the Rhone and Saône Rivers north of Marseille.

This great designer, whose fertility was so wonderful received his first instruction in art from his father, and at the age of eleven was placed in the studio of Vouet. There he attracted the notice of Poussin, and in 1642 accompanied him to Italy, remaining there four years. On his return, he was for a while at Lyons, and then settled down in Paris. His skill soon brought him before the notice of the eminent personages of his day, and he received an important commission from Fouquet, and painted a large picture for Queen Anne of Austria, who in return gave him her portrait set in diamonds. Cardinal Mazarin introduced him to Louis XIV, and he speedily became a very popular person at court, and held almost unlimited sway over all artistic matters after the death of Le Sueur. He was intimately concerned in 1648 in the foundation of the Academy, and when the king, under the advice of Colbert, founded the Gobelin tapestry works in1662, Lebrun was appointed director, and was styled \"a person skillful and intelligent in the art of painting, to make designs for tapestry, sculpture, and other works, to see that they were correctly rendered, and to direct slid overlook all the workmen employed\". Lebrun was responsible for designing almost all the important cartoons for the early work of the Gobelin factory, but beyond that, he was responsible for decoration and for statues at Versailles, for a long series of allegorical paintings, and for decoration work at Sceaux, Versailles, and Marly. When Colbert died in 1683, Lebrun lost his great patron, and during the last few years of his life, he withdrew from court, and fell into a condition of melancholy which continued until the time of his death. He was a great scenic artist, inspired by grand ideas, a man of unceasing energy, with a fine color sense, and good knowledge of decoration, but his work was somewhat heavy, and the influence he exercised over French art was not wholly to its advantage.\n\nDocument 5: Valenciennes, town, Nord département, Hauts-de-France région, northern France, on the Escaut (Scheldt) River. The origin of the name is obscure. Some believe that it stems from one of the three Roman emperors called Valentinian. Others attribute it to a corruption of val des cygnes (“valley of the swans”), swans being featured on the civic coat of arms.\nThe town flourished under the counts of Hainaut. In 1328 Philippa of Hainaut married Edward III of England there. In 1433 Valenciennes came under the control of Philip III (the Good) and then passed to Charles I (the Bold), both dukes of Burgundy. Louis XI tried in vain to capture it, but the first treaty of Nijmegen (1678) finally ceded it to France. Much of the town was destroyed during World War I (by Allied raids) and again during World War II. After the latter, a new town centre was built.\nValenciennes was once important for its fine lace; the industry practically died out but was renovated to some extent. Prosperity was brought to Valenciennes by the exploitation of the first French coalfield and the development of ironworking and subsequent steelworking. But these traditional industries were endangered in the early 1980s because of an economic downturn. Coal mines and blast furnaces have since closed, and, despite the continued presence of metalworking industries, the town experienced a substantial loss of industrial employment. By the end of the 20th century, an automotive industry had developed, and several large assembly plants and component manufacturing companies were established. Food processing and packaging industries are also important.\nThe town is home to the University of Valenciennes and the Museum of Fine Arts, which displays works by such masters as Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony Van Dyck, as well as notable local painters, including Antoine Watteau and Henri Harpignies.

It is a major centre of business, situated between Paris and Marseille, and has a reputation as the French capital of gastronomy and a significant role in the history of cinema.\nTogether with its suburbs and satellite towns, Lyon forms the second largest metropolitan area in France after Paris, with 1,783,400 inhabitants at the 2007 estimate, and approximately the 20th to 25th largest metropolitan area of Western Europe.\nLyon is the préfecture (capital) of the Rhône département, and also the capital of the Rhône-Alpes région.\nThe city gave its name to the Lyonnais province, of which it was the capital. Today the region around Lyon is still known as Lyonnais (French: le Lyonnais), or sometimes even as the Lyonnaise Region (French: Région Lyonnaise). Lyonnaise Region is an unofficial, popular name, not to be confused with the administrative région of Rhône-Alpes, which is much larger than the Lyonnaise Region.\nLyon is known as the silk capital of the world and is known for its silk and textiles and is a center for fashion.\nLyon is also the international headquarters of Interpol and EuroNews.\n\nDocument 7: The Capetians firmly established Paris as the French capital. The city grew as the power of the French kings increased. In the 11th cent. the city spread to the right bank. During the next two centuries — the reign of Philip Augustus (1180-1223) is especially notable for the growth of Paris — streets were paved and the city walls enlarged; the first Louvre (a fortress) and several churches, including Notre-Dame, were constructed or begun; and the schools on the left bank were organized into the University of Paris. One of them, the Sorbonne, became a fountainhead of theological learning with Albertus Magnus and St. Thomas Aquinas among its scholars. The university community constituted an autonomous borough; another was formed on the right bank by merchants ruled by their own provost. In 1358, under the leadership of the merchant provost Etienne Marcel, Paris first assumed the role of an independent commune and rebelled against the dauphin (later Charles V). During the period of the Hundred Years War the city suffered civil strife, occupation by the English (1419-36), famine, and the Black Death.\nDuring the Renaissance\nThe Renaissance reached Paris in the 16th cent. during the reign of Francis I (1515-47). At this time the Louvre was transformed from a fortress to a Renaissance palace. In the Wars of Religion (1562-98), Parisian Catholics, who were in the great majority, took part in the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day (1572), forced Henry III to leave the city on the Day of Barricades (1588), and accepted Henry IV only after his conversion (1593) to Catholicism. Cardinal Richelieu, Louis XIII's minister, established the French Academy and built the Palais Royal and the Luxembourg Palace. During the Fronde, Paris once again defied the royal authority. Louis XIV, distrustful of the Parisians, transferred (1682) his court to Versailles. Parisian industries profited from the lavishness of Versailles; the specialization in luxury goods dates from that time. J. H. Mansart under Louis XIV and Francois Mansart, J. G. Soufflot, and J. A. Gabriel under Louis XV created some of the most majestic prospects of modern Paris.\n\nDocument 8: Paris’s population was around 200,000 when the Black Death arrived in A.D. 1348, killing as many as 800 people a day.\nParis lost its position as seat of the French realm during occupation of the English-allied during the Hundred Years’ War, but regained its title when Charles VII of France reclaimed the city from English rule in A.D. 1436.\nParisians rose in rebellion and the royal family fled the city (1648).

This event turned Lyons into the second center of the Kingdom of France, significantly boosting the city's status and leading to increased commercial and artistic exchange. The rise in manuscript production and the establishment of a printing press in 1473 further solidified Lyons' position as an artistic hub.\n\nThe city's silk industry, dating back to the 15th century, played a crucial role in establishing Lyons as a major center for textiles and fashion, reinforcing its importance in both artistic and commercial spheres. Lyons' strategic location and historical significance as a cultural and economic hub continued to grow, with the city becoming a destination for trade fairs and attracting wealthy merchants and bankers. By the end of the 16th century, King Francois I allowed Lyon the right to produce silk, which became a massive industry and a significant employer throughout the 19th century.\n\nDuring the same period, Italy saw the rise of Milan, Florence, and Venice as dominant players, which eventually agreed to the Peace of Lodi in 1454, leading to unprecedented peace for much of the 15th century. The Italian Renaissance began in Tuscany, centered in the city of Florence, and spread to Rome, which was largely rebuilt by the Renaissance popes. The era of Josquin Desprez was one of the most creative and decisive for Western music, with Josquin appearing as the first featured composer in print, which significantly influenced his future reputation.\n\nThe influx of new capital in Europe, particularly in Italy, led to the growth of a new merchant class and the bankers that supported them, allowing merchants to compete for prestige and power by commissioning works of art from leading artists in their communities. The House of Medici of Florence, among others, supported nearly every type of art of the Renaissance, from painting and sculpture to music and poetry.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of Lyons as an important artistic and commercial center in France during the late 15th and early 16th centuries was influenced by the relocation of the French court, the growth of manuscript production, the silk industry, and the city's strategic location. This period also saw significant artistic and commercial developments in Italy, with the rise of the Italian Renaissance and the growth of a new merchant class commissioning works of art. These factors collectively contributed to the rise of both Lyons and Italian cities as cultural and economic powerhouses in their respective regions."}
{"id": 45, "question": "Why do women have different susceptibility to allergies and autoimmune diseases compared to men?", "passages": [{"passage": "An allergy occurs when a person’s immune system reacts sensitively to a foreign substance which may be pollen or bee venom or any other thing. Our immune system produces antibodies to fight against unwanted substances that are harmful for us. During an allergy, the body produces antibodies to fight off against substances that do not cause harm. This immune system reaction can trigger conditions such as inflammation of skin, nasal passages or the digestive system. This can be termed as an allergic reaction.\nIf the allergic reaction becomes severe enough to induce life threatening symptoms then it is referred to as an Anaphylaxis. During this condition a person experiences severe allergic reactions and if not treated in time, it may even result in death.\nA study has shown that women commonly, experience more severe allergic reactions than men owing to their estrogen hormones.\nStudies pertaining to anaphylaxis are difficult to perform because of its life threatening nature. About 200 people die from anaphylaxis every year in the United States, but these numbers could be bigger, because many people die from unrecognized anaphylaxis. A person may be suffering from heart disease and may die because of a heart attack, but it’s also possible that the attack may well have been induced by a severe allergic reaction.\nResearchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID have found that female mice are more prone to more severe anaphylactic reactions as compared to their male counterparts. They discovered that estradiol, which is an estrogen, enhances the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which produces some of the common symptoms that are attributed to anaphylaxis.\nOnly when plain eNOS is introduced into the system of the person undergoing anaphylaxis will result in the drop of blood pressure of the person, enabling the fluid in the blood vessels to leak into the surrounding tissue, which would in turn cause swelling. Adding estradiol would further cause the symptoms to become more pronounced than ever.\nResearchers in a bid to understand that whether estradiol was the real culprit blocked the estrogen in female mice. And the results showed that female mice experienced similar levels of allergic reactions as their male counterparts, thereby further strengthening the research.\nSo overall, the research concluded that gender factor does play an important role in allergies.\n“More women are admitted to hospitals for anaphylaxis as compared to men which indicates that something is going on here. Too often these gender differences are not focused on.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:6b6958d8-b462-417f-abbf-987be6b7e5a6>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Study Explores Cause for Higher Autoimmune Disease Prevalence Among Women\nA molecular switch in the skin cells may cause increased susceptibility to autoimmunity in women.\nWomen are 4 times more likely to develop autoimmune disease than men. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the prevalence of the disease is 9 times higher among women; however, the cause of this disparity is largely unknown, a recent study indicates.\nThe study, published in JCI Insight, examined the potential mechanisms promoting increased likelihood of autoimmunity in women as opposed to men. The study pointed to a skin-targeted overexpression of the female-biased transcription cofactor vestigial like family member 3 (VGLL3) as a potential contributor to autoimmunity. Previous research has indicated that women have more VGLL3 in their skin cells than men.\nAccording to the study, the researchers found that in mice, having too much VGLL3 in skin cells promoted an autoimmune response that extended beyond the skin. In the mouse model, overexpression of VGLL3 drove an autoimmunity-prone transcriptional signature similar to that observed in female skin, causing inflammation and activation of type I IFN signaling that mimics cutaneous lupus, according to the researchers.\nAdditionally, the researchers noted that extra VGLL3 in the skin cells appeared to change expression levels of a number of genes important to the immune system, including many of the same genes altered in autoimmune diseases. In mice with excess VGLL3, their skin became scaly and raw and they produced antibodies against their own tissues.\n“VGLL3 appears to regulate immune response genes that have been implicated as important to autoimmune diseases that are more common in women, but that don’t appear to be regulated by sex hormones,” lead study author Johann Gudjonsson, MD, PhD, professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan Medical School, said in a press release. “Now, we have shown that overexpression of VGLL3 in the skin of transgenic mice is by itself sufficient to drive a phenotype that has striking similarities to systemic lupus erythematosus, including skin rash, and kidney injury.”\nThe researchers concluded that the data support the assertion that overexpression of VGLL3 in female skin primes women for autoimmunity.

C.\nPublic Library of Science\n1 - 12\nItem Usage Stats\nMetadataShow full item record\nBackground: Autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are characterized by a strong genetic susceptibility from the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) locus. Additionally, disorders of epigenetic processes, in particular non-random X chromosome inactivation (XCI), have been reported in many female-predominant autoimmune diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that women with RA or SSc who are strongly genetically predisposed are less susceptible to XCI bias. Methods: Using methylation sensitive genotyping of the androgen receptor (AR) gene, XCI profiles were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 161 women with RA, 96 women with SSc and 100 healthy women. HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 were genotyped. Presence of specific autoantibodies was documented for patients. XCI skewing was defined as having a ratio ≥ 80:20 of cells inactivating the same X chromosome. Results: 110 women with RA, 68 women with SSc, and 69 controls were informative for the AR polymorphism. Among them 40.9% of RA patients and 36.8% of SSc patients had skewed XCI compared to 17.4% of healthy women (P = 0.002 and 0.018, respectively). Presence of RA-susceptibility alleles coding for the \"shared epitope\" correlated with higher skewing among RA patients (P = 0.002) and such correlation was not observed in other women, healthy or with SSc. Presence of SSc-susceptibility alleles did not correlate with XCI patterns among SSc patients. Conclusion: Data demonstrate XCI skewing in both RA and SSc compared to healthy women. Unexpectedly, skewed XCI occurs more often in women with RA carrying the shared epitope, which usually reflects severe disease.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:371ffb19-04eb-49a4-931c-43b2d4005e58>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Why Women Get More Fibromyalgia, IBS, and Anxiety Than Men\nBy Dr. David M. Brady and Danielle Moyer, MS\nThe occurrence of fibromyalgia is 10 to 20 times higher in women than in men . Those women are also more likely than men to have severe tender points of pain, “pain all over”, sleep disturbances, and fatigue .\nThe incidence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is higher in women when compared to men. Internationally, the prevalence of IBS is 67% higher in women .\nAnxiety disorders are more than twice as likely to occur in women when compared to men .\nThe question is: why?\nThough the reasons are still being studied, research suggests that an interaction between biology, psychology, and sociocultural factors leads to higher occurrences of these diseases in women . Of particular interest is the role of women’s hormonal and nervous systems, which respond somewhat differently to stress and trauma than those of men .\nResearch by the American Psychological Association looked at 290 studies between 1980 and 2005 to determine if men or women were more at risk for potentially traumatic events and PTSD (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder). The results concluded that, although men experience more traumatic events on average than women, women are more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. PTSD is an anxiety disorder caused by a traumatic event and symptoms include “re-experiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing and hyperarousal .” PTSD occurs in 10-12% of women and 5-6% of men, making the rate in women almost double . Women’s PTSD also tends to last longer (on average four years), whereas men’s lasts one year on average .\nThe types of trauma men and women experience are different as well. Men are more likely to experience trauma from natural disasters, human-caused disasters, accidents, and combat, whereas women are more likely to experience trauma from domestic violence, sexual abuse, and sexual assault . Sexual trauma has been shown to be particularly toxic to mental health, and can typically begin at a young age when the brain is still developing . This can impact a woman's fear and stress response well into adulthood.\nTrauma, stressors, and/or PTSD alter pain processing and incoming stimuli in an individual. They can frequently cause an excessive stress response, significant and chronic pain, and central sensitization disorders .", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:a5a035ab-6e40-4307-a830-becf9a1f623e>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "Do little girls stay too clean?\nOne of the most popular of the Just William stories tells how William and his Outlaw friends were joined one day by the cherished and sheltered Violet Elizabeth Bott.

(7)\nThere are other hormonal factors to consider regarding the “over reactive” stress response in women. This stress response triggers the gene expression responsible for disrupting the endocrine system. That’s where significant problems begin.\nThe heightened stress response in women is generally considered to be a survival instinct. Women – as the reproductive gender – may need a higher rate of stress hormones to assure procreation.\nHowever, that heightened ability (at chronic levels) tips the scales into disruption, dysfunction, and the tendency toward disease. The resulting endocrine disruption increases the risk factors for thyroid dysfunction, glycemic dysregulation, diabetes, and more.

Many people who deal with chronic health challenges report an impaired immune system and increased frequency of colds, flu, etc.\nThis is different from the over active immune response that leads to autoimmunity. Yet, they’re both part of the same equation. The immune system – and the risk for autoimmune predisposition – are definitely impacted by gender-related hormones.\nAccording to this National Institute of Health report, “It is well established that gender plays a profound role in the incidence of autoimmunity with diseases such as lupus occurring much more frequently in females than in males. This is related to higher numbers of circulating antibodies as well as other factors.” (9)\nThe good news is that once we’re aware of why risk factors may be increased for females, we’re now empowered with the information we need to take action and reduce our exposure to these risks.", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:762a2701-11c1-41e4-9a34-ddea3735ab6d>::chunk-3"]}, {"passage": "- It might be Mom’s fault.

Second, it appears that hormones affect RA risk and flares. Many women with RA who get pregnant experience fewer or no symptoms at all, only to find that they reappear after the baby is born.

The studies found, further, that the less diverse, populous, and evenly distributed the microbiome was, the more intense lupus symptoms (including kidney symptoms) are present.\nPeople with lupus experience more bacterial infections than otherwise healthy people. Staph, in particular, is a leading cause of infection in people with lupus. Staph infections are linked to serious conditions including necrotizing fasciitis (although there are other bacteria that can be involved) a devastating flesh-eating infection that can also infect people who are on immunosuppressants.\nPeople with lupus have less-diverse and less-densely populated microbiomes than otherwise healthy people, as determined by some studies. Lupus lesions, when tested, have very different microbiomes than the rest of the skin. One bacterium in particular is Staphyococcus aureus, the bacteria responsible for staph infections. About 40-50% of their skin was colonized by staph bacteria, compared to 30% in people who do not have lupus. Staph can be present on the body long before it invades. It also may trigger inflammation or flares just by being on the skin.

The opposite is true, however. In the US, for example, women outlive men by an average of 5-7 years and, according to the World Health Organization in 2006, this pattern is true for all countries on earth.\nWhile lifestyle choices certainly play a role in the disparity, some researchers argue that genetics may also be a factor. After all, the tendency for females to outlive males applies not only to humans, but for all mammal species.\nFactors that may explain why women live longer than men\nSeveral biological theories are commonly mentioned:\n- The higher level of testosterone hormone in men leads them to engage in more violent or risky behavior.\n- Until menopause, the higher estrogen levels in women serves a protective function against \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. Thus, women generally tend to avoid the earlier signs of heart disease commonly seen in men.\n- Women tend to have lower iron levels through a significant portion of their life due to menstruation -- and iron, which comes primarily from meats in our diet, plays a strong role in the formation of cell-damaging and cell-aging free-radicals.\n- Because females have 2 X chromosomes (versus XY in males), defects in one chromosome may be offset by the other. (In birds, however, the chromosome variation is reversed: female birds have ZW chromosomes whereas males have the same ZZ. And, as a result, male tend to outlive females in most bird species.)\n+ Free Shipping & Returns on Eligible Items.\n(*Amazon's Top 100 list updated hourly.)\nA recent theory is that, in general, smaller individuals in a species live longer.

The study reports gender-specific neural correlates of anxiety during stress provocation, mainly in the medial prefrontal and parietal cortices, with opposite patterns of associations in men and women.\nSpecifically, gender interaction from whole-brain regression analyses was observed in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, left inferior parietal lobe, left temporal gyrus, occipital gyrus, and cerebellum, with positive associations between activity in these regions and stress-induced anxiety in women, but negative associations in men, indicating that men and women differentially utilize neural resources when experiencing stress-induced anxiety. The observed neural difference indicates that men and women differentially utilize neural resources when experiencing anxiety during stress.\nA2022 review indicates that here are multiple phenotypic differences between the immune systems of men and women. In general, men are more vulnerable to infectious diseases, and women are more prone to autoimmune diseases.\n\nDocument 4: Study Explores Cause for Higher Autoimmune Disease Prevalence Among Women\nA molecular switch in the skin cells may cause increased susceptibility to autoimmunity in women.\nWomen are 4 times more likely to develop autoimmune disease than men. In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the prevalence of the disease is 9 times higher among women; however, the cause of this disparity is largely unknown, a recent study indicates.\nThe study, published in JCI Insight, examined the potential mechanisms promoting increased likelihood of autoimmunity in women as opposed to men. The study pointed to a skin-targeted overexpression of the female-biased transcription cofactor vestigial like family member 3 (VGLL3) as a potential contributor to autoimmunity. Previous research has indicated that women have more VGLL3 in their skin cells than men.\nAccording to the study, the researchers found that in mice, having too much VGLL3 in skin cells promoted an autoimmune response that extended beyond the skin. In the mouse model, overexpression of VGLL3 drove an autoimmunity-prone transcriptional signature similar to that observed in female skin, causing inflammation and activation of type I IFN signaling that mimics cutaneous lupus, according to the researchers.\nAdditionally, the researchers noted that extra VGLL3 in the skin cells appeared to change expression levels of a number of genes important to the immune system, including many of the same genes altered in autoimmune diseases. In mice with excess VGLL3, their skin became scaly and raw and they produced antibodies against their own tissues.\n“VGLL3 appears to regulate immune response genes that have been implicated as important to autoimmune diseases that are more common in women, but that don’t appear to be regulated by sex hormones,” lead study author Johann Gudjonsson, MD, PhD, professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan Medical School, said in a press release. “Now, we have shown that overexpression of VGLL3 in the skin of transgenic mice is by itself sufficient to drive a phenotype that has striking similarities to systemic lupus erythematosus, including skin rash, and kidney injury.”\nThe researchers concluded that the data support the assertion that overexpression of VGLL3 in female skin primes women for autoimmunity. However, they do not know what triggers may set off overexpression of VGLL3 activity.\n\nDocument 5: Evaluation of X chromosome inactivation with respect to HLA genetic susceptibility in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis\nKanaan, S.

C.\nPublic Library of Science\n1 - 12\nItem Usage Stats\nMetadataShow full item record\nBackground: Autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are characterized by a strong genetic susceptibility from the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) locus. Additionally, disorders of epigenetic processes, in particular non-random X chromosome inactivation (XCI), have been reported in many female-predominant autoimmune diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that women with RA or SSc who are strongly genetically predisposed are less susceptible to XCI bias. Methods: Using methylation sensitive genotyping of the androgen receptor (AR) gene, XCI profiles were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 161 women with RA, 96 women with SSc and 100 healthy women. HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 were genotyped. Presence of specific autoantibodies was documented for patients. XCI skewing was defined as having a ratio ≥ 80:20 of cells inactivating the same X chromosome. Results: 110 women with RA, 68 women with SSc, and 69 controls were informative for the AR polymorphism. Among them 40.9% of RA patients and 36.8% of SSc patients had skewed XCI compared to 17.4% of healthy women (P = 0.002 and 0.018, respectively). Presence of RA-susceptibility alleles coding for the \"shared epitope\" correlated with higher skewing among RA patients (P = 0.002) and such correlation was not observed in other women, healthy or with SSc. Presence of SSc-susceptibility alleles did not correlate with XCI patterns among SSc patients. Conclusion: Data demonstrate XCI skewing in both RA and SSc compared to healthy women. Unexpectedly, skewed XCI occurs more often in women with RA carrying the shared epitope, which usually reflects severe disease.\n\nDocument 6: Women’s immune system genes operate differently from men’s\nAbout (English version):\nA new technology for studying the human body’s vast system for toggling genes on and off reveals that genes associated with the immune system toggle more frequently, and those same genes operate differently in women and men.\nType of resource:\nDynamic Content (website,portal, blog, newsfeed, etc.)\nIs this resource freely shareable?:\n\nDocument 7: (6)\nEstrogen dominance has long been discussed in relationship to chronic illness and autoimmune conditions. Do you experience any of these symptoms of estrogen dominance?\n- Weight gain\n- Hair loss\n- Cold hands/feet\n- Thyroid dysfunction\n- Fibrocystic and/or tender breasts\n- Impaired metabolism\n- Cognitive impairment\nConsidering these familiar symptoms, it’s no wonder that estrogen dominance is linked to systemic dysfunction including autoimmune conditions, heightened allergic responses, and rapid aging. (7)\nThere are other hormonal factors to consider regarding the “over reactive” stress response in women. This stress response triggers the gene expression responsible for disrupting the endocrine system. That’s where significant problems begin.\nThe heightened stress response in women is generally considered to be a survival instinct. Women – as the reproductive gender – may need a higher rate of stress hormones to assure procreation.\nHowever, that heightened ability (at chronic levels) tips the scales into disruption, dysfunction, and the tendency toward disease. The resulting endocrine disruption increases the risk factors for thyroid dysfunction, glycemic dysregulation, diabetes, and more. (8)\n3) Immunity factors\nNow we get to the topic of the immune system and autoimmunity. Stress hormones affect the immune system by depressing or delaying response. Many people who deal with chronic health challenges report an impaired immune system and increased frequency of colds, flu, etc.\nThis is different from the over active immune response that leads to autoimmunity. Yet, they’re both part of the same equation. The immune system – and the risk for autoimmune predisposition – are definitely impacted by gender-related hormones.\nAccording to this National Institute of Health report, “It is well established that gender plays a profound role in the incidence of autoimmunity with diseases such as lupus occurring much more frequently in females than in males. This is related to higher numbers of circulating antibodies as well as other factors.” (9)\nThe good news is that once we’re aware of why risk factors may be increased for females, we’re now empowered with the information we need to take action and reduce our exposure to these risks.\n\nDocument 8: - It might be Mom’s fault. Having a family history of the condition raises risk for both genders and, interestingly, the connection is even stronger for women. A woman whose mother has or had arthritis is likely to develop the problem at the same age and in the same joints.\nRheumatoid Arthritis: A More Aggressive Immune System Raises Women’s Risk\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) is different from osteoarthritis in that the inflammation is an autoimmune reaction and unrelated to wear and tear on the joints. Three times as many women as men get RA. Also, women tend to be younger when they get RA and, as with osteoarthritis, their pain is worse.\nExperts believe there are two main reasons for the gender differences in RA. First, women get autoimmune diseases in far greater numbers than men – it’s thought that the female immune system is stronger and more reactive. Second, it appears that hormones affect RA risk and flares. Many women with RA who get pregnant experience fewer or no symptoms at all, only to find that they reappear after the baby is born. And breastfeeding lowers the risk of developing RA; a woman who has breastfed for two years has reduced the risk she will ever get the condition by half.\n\nDocument 9: Why do women tend to like dark skin on other women more than men do?\nXRenX 2012/07/28 20:38:05\nIn general this is what I've observed. Like women like dark skin and men don't. I wonder why each of them feel that way.\nSee Votes by State\nHot Questions on SodaHead\nMore Hot Questions\n\nDocument 10: RA is an autoimmune condition experienced more commonly by females than males and is thought to occur or result from a combination of factors including genetic, environment and other unknown events that occur within our bodies (Pollard 2012).\n\nDocument 11: Hormone differences between sexes also effect the microbiome, and ethnicity seems to also have some effect (though the exact reasons for this are unknown). Hygiene and cosmetic use also can change the skin microbiome, which you can read more about here. The skin microbiome also changes naturally as a person ages.\nSkin Microbiome and Lupus\nWhen tested, the skin microbiotia in people with lupus is very different from healthy controls. The studies found, further, that the less diverse, populous, and evenly distributed the microbiome was, the more intense lupus symptoms (including kidney symptoms) are present.\nPeople with lupus experience more bacterial infections than otherwise healthy people. Staph, in particular, is a leading cause of infection in people with lupus. Staph infections are linked to serious conditions including necrotizing fasciitis (although there are other bacteria that can be involved) a devastating flesh-eating infection that can also infect people who are on immunosuppressants.\nPeople with lupus have less-diverse and less-densely populated microbiomes than otherwise healthy people, as determined by some studies. Lupus lesions, when tested, have very different microbiomes than the rest of the skin. One bacterium in particular is Staphyococcus aureus, the bacteria responsible for staph infections. About 40-50% of their skin was colonized by staph bacteria, compared to 30% in people who do not have lupus. Staph can be present on the body long before it invades. It also may trigger inflammation or flares just by being on the skin. Since the skin cells can detect it and will release interferon, summoning the immune system to deal with the bacteria before it causes an infection.\nThe interferons released by these skin cells help the staph bacteria “stick” to the skin. The interferon seems, specifically, to break down some of the barriers between skin cells and the outside world. Reducing the toughness of the cells. It is thought that this allows the bacteria to get a foothold.\nWhat is Cutaneous Lupus?\nCutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE,) is a form of lupus that primarily effects the skin. Symptoms include rashes, sores, and disk-shaped raise blotches on the skin (discoid lesions) and can appear on the face, ears, neck, arms, legs, and hands.\n\nDocument 12: - Women, Testosterone Levels and Sex Drive\n\nDocument 13: Why do women live longer than men?\nBeing the bigger and stronger of the sexes, one might assume that men would normally live longer, healthier lives than women. The opposite is true, however. In the US, for example, women outlive men by an average of 5-7 years and, according to the World Health Organization in 2006, this pattern is true for all countries on earth.\nWhile lifestyle choices certainly play a role in the disparity, some researchers argue that genetics may also be a factor. After all, the tendency for females to outlive males applies not only to humans, but for all mammal species.\nFactors that may explain why women live longer than men\nSeveral biological theories are commonly mentioned:\n- The higher level of testosterone hormone in men leads them to engage in more violent or risky behavior.\n- Until menopause, the higher estrogen levels in women serves a protective function against \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. Thus, women generally tend to avoid the earlier signs of heart disease commonly seen in men.\n- Women tend to have lower iron levels through a significant portion of their life due to menstruation -- and iron, which comes primarily from meats in our diet, plays a strong role in the formation of cell-damaging and cell-aging free-radicals.\n- Because females have 2 X chromosomes (versus XY in males), defects in one chromosome may be offset by the other. (In birds, however, the chromosome variation is reversed: female birds have ZW chromosomes whereas males have the same ZZ. And, as a result, male tend to outlive females in most bird species.)\n+ Free Shipping & Returns on Eligible Items.\n(*Amazon's Top 100 list updated hourly.)\nA recent theory is that, in general, smaller individuals in a species live longer. Perhaps this is because their development involves fewer cell doublings and a reduced demand for ongoing tissue regeneration over a lifetime. Supporting this theory is the fact that age-related diseases generally appear earlier in men than in women.\nThis is probably where the dramatic differences between male and female longevity are determined:\n- Men tend to drink and smoke more. (One US study conducted in Erie County, PA in the early 1970's indicated that, among non-smokers, there is no difference in life expectancy between men and women.)\n\nDocument 14: Why Women Get More Fibromyalgia, IBS, and Anxiety Than Men\nBy Dr. David M. Brady and Danielle Moyer, MS\nThe occurrence of fibromyalgia is 10 to 20 times higher in women than in men . Those women are also more likely than men to have severe tender points of pain, “pain all over”, sleep disturbances, and fatigue .\nThe incidence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is higher in women when compared to men. Internationally, the prevalence of IBS is 67% higher in women .\nAnxiety disorders are more than twice as likely to occur in women when compared to men .\nThe question is: why?\nThough the reasons are still being studied, research suggests that an interaction between biology, psychology, and sociocultural factors leads to higher occurrences of these diseases in women . Of particular interest is the role of women’s hormonal and nervous systems, which respond somewhat differently to stress and trauma than those of men .\nResearch by the American Psychological Association looked at 290 studies between 1980 and 2005 to determine if men or women were more at risk for potentially traumatic events and PTSD (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder). The results concluded that, although men experience more traumatic events on average than women, women are more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. PTSD is an anxiety disorder caused by a traumatic event and symptoms include “re-experiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing and hyperarousal .” PTSD occurs in 10-12% of women and 5-6% of men, making the rate in women almost double . Women’s PTSD also tends to last longer (on average four years), whereas men’s lasts one year on average .\nThe types of trauma men and women experience are different as well. Men are more likely to experience trauma from natural disasters, human-caused disasters, accidents, and combat, whereas women are more likely to experience trauma from domestic violence, sexual abuse, and sexual assault . Sexual trauma has been shown to be particularly toxic to mental health, and can typically begin at a young age when the brain is still developing . This can impact a woman's fear and stress response well into adulthood.\nTrauma, stressors, and/or PTSD alter pain processing and incoming stimuli in an individual. They can frequently cause an excessive stress response, significant and chronic pain, and central sensitization disorders .\n\nDocument 15: Hypothyroidism And Autoimmune Disease - Is Als An Autoimmune Disease\nRealize that you can most likely experience a normal life without depression, pain, and fatigue.

Most people are not familiar with this fact.\nCure For Hashimotos Autoimmune Disease, All Autoimmune Diseases, Alopecia Areata Autoimmune Disease, An Autoimmune Disease, An Autoimmune Disease Is, Ana Autoimmune Disease, Ankylosing Spondylitis Autoimmune Disease, Antibiotics And Autoimmune Disease, Aps Autoimmune Disease, Are Allergies Autoimmune Diseases, Are Autoimmune Diseases Contagious, Are Autoimmune Diseases Genetic\n\nQuestion: Why do women have different susceptibility to allergies and autoimmune diseases compared to men?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "Women have different susceptibility to allergies and autoimmune diseases compared to men due to various factors, including hormonal influences, genetic predispositions, and differences in immune system responses. Estrogen hormones can enhance allergic reactions and contribute to autoimmune disease development in women by increasing histamine production and release, reducing histamine metabolism, and modulating the immune system's response to stress and trauma. Genetic factors such as specific HLA alleles and the overexpression of certain genes like VGLL3 in women's skin cells may also increase their susceptibility to autoimmune diseases.\n\nThe immune system's response to stress and trauma differs between genders, with women experiencing more severe reactions and longer-lasting effects, which may contribute to higher rates of autoimmune conditions. Chronic stress can disrupt the gut microbiota in women, leading to an increased likelihood of autoimmune diseases. Additionally, women's immune systems may be more sensitive to stress-induced changes in the gut microbiome, which can stimulate immune cells and increase the risk of autoimmune reactions.\n\nFurthermore, women are more likely to exhibit contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions, and less likely to have sexual or religious obsessions, which may be related to their higher susceptibility to autoimmune conditions. The average age of OCD onset is also earlier in women, which could be linked to hormonal changes and stress responses.\n\nIn summary, the immune system's response to stress and trauma differs between genders, with women experiencing more severe and prolonged effects, which contributes to higher rates of autoimmune conditions. This is influenced by hormonal factors, genetic predispositions, and the way the immune system reacts to stress and trauma."}

The two companies announced their partnership on the Parkinson’s medication Tuesday morning.\nIndianapolis-based Lilly has not yet begun human trials of its drug, known as a glial cell derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF. Lilly said in a press release that it has engineered the biotech drug to distribute more broadly than other neurotrophic agents have in previous tests. Minneapolis-based Medtronic’s system, which uses a pump and catheter, supplies a steady amount of the drug to a specific brain region over time.\nFinancial terms of the partnership were not disclosed.\n“By collaborating with Medtronic from the earliest phase of research, we are maximizing the potential for this therapy's efficient and effective development,” said Michael L. Hutton, chief scientific officer of Lilly’s neurodegeneration team, in a prepared statement.\nThere is no known cure for Parkinson’s, a condition caused by the loss of brain neurons that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger key to the brain’s coordination of movement. Parkinson’s patients suffer from imbalance, tremors and muscle stiffness.\nSome of the most famous victims of Parkinson’s are the former boxer Muhammad Ali and actor Michael J. Fox. They are among more than 7 million estimated Parkinson’s patients worldwide.\nBy injecting neurotrophic factors into the brain, scientists expect that they would strengthen existing neurons, helping them produce more dopamine, said Ros Smith, senior director of regenerative biology at Lilly. Keeping neurons functioning longer could slow progression of Parkinson’s rather than treating its symptoms, as existing therapies do.\nHowever, because neurotrophic factors are large proteins, they don’t easily cross from the bloodstream into the brain, Smith said. But Lilly scientists hope that Medtronic’s delivery system can overcome that obstacle.\n\"One of the most significant challenges in delivering a biologic treatment for neurodegenerative diseases is crossing the blood brain barrier.

In addition, 300 construction jobs will be created on the site. IDA Ireland worked closely with Eli Lilly to attract this investment to Ireland.\nThe planned 240,000-square-foot facility will enhance the company’s ability to bring treatments for illnesses such as cancer and diabetes to patients worldwide. This is the second large investment Lilly has made at its Kinsale site in recent years.

Last fall, Clem installed a sewer line and the city of Lebanon took the opportunity to upgrade its 60-year-old water main.\nIn addition, “we’re spending $1 million in 2019 to make upgrades to allow for another 200,000 gallons of sewer capacity, and we’re going to follow up next year for additional capacity for the city,” said Mulholland.\nHe also noted the city’s goal of encouraging mixed-used development downtown and zoning approval for building heights to allow for an additional floor of construction, and the planning board has also approved an additional industrial park, adjacent to an existing park on municipal land by the airport.\nThe infrastructure investments have been sparked by growing demand for commercial space in the area.\n“The Dartmouth Regional Technology Center is full. They don’t have enough space,” said Mulholland, referring to the nonprofit incubator that is run in partnership with Grafton County Economic Development Corp. Centerra Business Park is also completely filled, he said.\n“We have businesses that want to move out of the DRTC and they need a place to do that,” said Mulholland.\nOne such business is FreshAir Sensor, which sells devices that detect tobacco or marijuana smoke in real time and send immediate notifications to hotel and apartment managers.\nThe company was launched in 2013 by a 33-year Dartmouth chemistry professor, who now serves as the company’s chief technology officer, and a graduate of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.

Improvements are already underway at the site.\nThe plant is currently operating near maximum capacity, prompting Elanco to invest in the capital expansion necessary to meet customers’ growing demand. More than 250 people are currently employed at Elanco’s manufacturing facility in Augusta, producing animal health products used by farmers around the globe. Elanco anticipates that the number of new jobs ultimately created as a result of the expansion will be contingent on new market approvals for Elanco products.\nThe Augusta plant and its employees play an important role at Elanco and for the company’s customers. VP of Manufacturing at Elanco, Steve Jenison, said, “An investment of this size is a testament to the performance of our operations in Augusta. We have every confidence in our employees at the site and the value our products bring to our customers.”\nGeneral Manager at the Augusta Technology Center, Kevin Trivett, said being located in Augusta is an asset to the company’s operations, saying “We feel very fortunate to have partnered with a community whose workforce is highly skilled, engaged and committed to our vision of meeting a global demand for more of our animal health products.”\nHenry Ingram, Chairman of the Augusta Economic Development Authority, said, “The investment of $100,000,000 is significant for our community and soon, more of our neighbors will be employed, thanks to Elanco’s investment in Augusta.”\nMayor Deke Copenhaver also commended the company’s decision to expand its presence in Augusta. “With their yearly efforts to help break the cycle of hunger locally as well as in 100 other communities worldwide, Elanco is a fine example of what it means to be a community partner. I would like to personally thank the Elanco team for this investment and for all that the company does to help make our city a great place.”\nAs an OSHA Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) “Star” worksite, the Augusta Technology Center is recognized for its comprehensive safety and health management programs. From a community reinvestment perspective, Elanco provides opportunities for employees to volunteer in the community and supports local sustainability initiatives.\n\nDocument 10: The Wellcome Tropical Research Laboratories opened in 1902; in the 1920s Burroughs Wellcome established research and manufacturing facilities in Tuckahoe, New York,:18 which served as the US headquarters until the company moved to Research Triangle Park in North Carolina in 1971. The Nobel Prize winning scientists Gertrude B. Elion and George H. Hitchings worked there and invented drugs still used many years later, such as mercaptopurine. In 1959 the Wellcome Foundation bought Cooper, McDougall & Robertson Inc to become more active in animal health. Glaxo and Wellcome merged in 1995 to form Glaxo Wellcome plc. Glaxo Wellcome restructured its R&D operation that year, cutting 10,000 jobs worldwide, closing its R&D facility in Beckenham, Kent, and opening a Medicines Research Centre in Stevenage, Hertfordshire.  Also that year, Glaxo Wellcome acquired the California-based Affymax, a leader in the field of combinatorial chemistry.\nBy 1999 Glaxo Wellcome had become the world's third-largest pharmaceutical company by revenues (behind Novartis and Merck), with a global market share of around 4 per cent, its products included Imigran (for the treatment of migraine), salbutamol (Ventolin) (for the treatment of asthma), Zovirax (for the treatment of coldsores), and Retrovir and Epivir (for the treatment of AIDS). In 1999 the company was the world's largest manufacturer of drugs for the treatment of asthma and HIV/AIDS, it employed 59,000 people, including 13,400 in the UK, had 76 operating companies and 50 manufacturing facilities worldwide, and seven of its products were among the world's top 50 best-selling pharmaceuticals. The company had R&D facilities in Hertfordshire, Kent and London, and manufacturing plants in Scotland and the north of England. It had R&D centres in the US and Japan, and production facilities in the US, Europe and the Far East.\nIn 1848 Thomas Beecham launched his Beecham's Pills laxative in England, giving birth to the Beecham Group; in 1859 Beecham opened its first factory in St Helens, Lancashire.\n\nDocument 11: Eli Lilly and Co. plans to use an implantable drug-delivery system made by Medtronic Inc. to precisely target patients' brains with an experimental drug for Parkinson’s disease. The two companies announced their partnership on the Parkinson’s medication Tuesday morning.\nIndianapolis-based Lilly has not yet begun human trials of its drug, known as a glial cell derived neurotrophic factor, or GDNF. Lilly said in a press release that it has engineered the biotech drug to distribute more broadly than other neurotrophic agents have in previous tests. Minneapolis-based Medtronic’s system, which uses a pump and catheter, supplies a steady amount of the drug to a specific brain region over time.\nFinancial terms of the partnership were not disclosed.\n“By collaborating with Medtronic from the earliest phase of research, we are maximizing the potential for this therapy's efficient and effective development,” said Michael L. Hutton, chief scientific officer of Lilly’s neurodegeneration team, in a prepared statement.\nThere is no known cure for Parkinson’s, a condition caused by the loss of brain neurons that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger key to the brain’s coordination of movement. Parkinson’s patients suffer from imbalance, tremors and muscle stiffness.\nSome of the most famous victims of Parkinson’s are the former boxer Muhammad Ali and actor Michael J. Fox. They are among more than 7 million estimated Parkinson’s patients worldwide.\nBy injecting neurotrophic factors into the brain, scientists expect that they would strengthen existing neurons, helping them produce more dopamine, said Ros Smith, senior director of regenerative biology at Lilly. Keeping neurons functioning longer could slow progression of Parkinson’s rather than treating its symptoms, as existing therapies do.\nHowever, because neurotrophic factors are large proteins, they don’t easily cross from the bloodstream into the brain, Smith said. But Lilly scientists hope that Medtronic’s delivery system can overcome that obstacle.\n\"One of the most significant challenges in delivering a biologic treatment for neurodegenerative diseases is crossing the blood brain barrier. We have extensive experience in targeted drug delivery and technology that allow delivery of therapeutic agents directly to the brain,” said Dr. Steve Oesterle, senior vice president of medicine and technology at Medtronic.\n\nDocument 12: Both tax rates assume the extension of the R&D tax credit for the full year 2012.\nOperating cash flows in 2012 are still expected to be more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures of approximately $800 million, as well as anticipated business development activity, the company's current dividend and stock repurchases.\nLilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing portfolio of pharmaceutical products by applying the latest research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with eminent scientific organizations.

{"id": 47, "question": "What happens to my property in California if I have a joint tenant and I die?", "passages": [{"passage": "The method of titling the ownership of property in California and elsewhere is generally an integral aspect of proper estate planning. By configuring the title to assets in designated ways during the life of the owner(s), estate planning can assure certain outcomes automatically on the death of an owner. The simplest form of ownership is where one individual owns the property in his/her name alone. If the asset is real estate, the single ownership model is called \"fee simple\" ownership, which represents the highest degree of unfettered ownership in real property.\nAssets owned as joint tenants with the right of survivorship represent ownership by the joint owners. For inheritance purposes, a deceased owner's share is automatically passed to the surviving joint tenant by operation of law. Assets titled this way do not pass through the decedent's estate but are automatically owned by the survivor. Assets owned individually in fee simple will pass to the decedent's heirs and must go through the decedent's estate at death.\nOwnership by tenants in common represents separate shares owned by each of the tenants. Thus, if there are three tenants in common owners of a parcel of real estate, the death of one tenant will pass that tenant's ownership interest onto that owner's heirs. The share of a deceased tenant in common will have to be reported by decedent's estate and treated as an estate asset.\nWhen an individual or married couple meet with an estate planning attorney to set up an estate plan, the attorney will explain and discuss the impact of the various ways of titling assets. Title to certain assets may be changed to conform to the owners' wishes for the most expedient way of transferring title at death. In some cases, title to an asset or assets will go into a living trust, which generally is a way of passing assets at death without going through the decedent's estate. In California and elsewhere, the issues to evaluate are usually too complex to justify do-it-yourself estate planning, and the matter should therefore be jointly undertaken in cooperation with an experienced estate planning attorney.\nSource: paulsvalleydailydemocrat.com, \"How to title your property\", Dan Barney, Oct. 25, 2017", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:6ab0cd02-2bf5-4a5b-99ad-509debd77fda>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "- Should a married couple have one will or two?\n- Does my wife get the house if I die?\n- Can husband disinherit his wife?\n- When a husband dies what is the wife called?\n- Can my wife change my will after I die?\n- Can spouse get house if not on deed?\n- What should you never put in your will?\n- How much is a spouse entitled to in a will?\n- What a surviving spouse needs to know?\n- Does will override marriage?\n- Can my spouse and I have a joint will?\n- Does the surviving spouse get everything?\n- Why are joint wills a bad idea?\n- Can a husband cut his wife out of his will?\n- Does beneficiary override spouse?\n- What happens if my husband died and I’m not on the mortgage?\nShould a married couple have one will or two?\nThe reality is, however, that both you and your spouse should each have your own will, and it should be planned as soon as possible.\nSome couples think that they can have one joint will together, but this is not a sound approach..\nDoes my wife get the house if I die?\nIn general, if there’s a spouse, then they will get the entire estate except in two situations: The deceased had children, but not with the spouse. … The deceased owned property as a joint tenant with someone else.\nCan husband disinherit his wife?\nYes, a spouse can be disinherited. … However, the surviving spouse may have a right to seek their rightful inheritance by filing a Right of Election.

Then that glazed look comes over their faces and I know instantly they are unfamiliar with those phrases. Usually we have a quick tutorial in Property 101 and ownership types and what it means on death and whether they have children to previous relationships.\nWhat’s all the fuss about then? Well it really does matter how you own your biggest asset – your home. If you hold the property as joint tenants, you cannot will your share and the survivor of the owners gets the property outright. For those with children together of that relationship they are likely to want joint tenants. On death it’s a simple transmission of the property title to the surviving party – easy!\nNot so easy when the partners or spouses have children from previous relationships. They have different obligations to their own children that the other partner or spouse do not. They are likely to want to ensure their share of the property goes to their children – fair enough. In that situation, we recommend they hold the property as tenants in common. Here’s the catch – they have to update their wills to allow the surviving partner or spouse to live in the property either for a period or time or for their lifetime. Otherwise, the Executors of the deceased partner or spouse can take steps to sell the property to meet the obligations to the beneficiaries of the deceased party. It can really complicate matters and create more anxiety for the surviving party.\nTenants in common can also be a good ownership option when you are getting older and have no family trust.

Joint tenants must obtain equal shares of the property with the same deed, at the same time. The terms of a joint tenancy (which differs from a tenancy in common) are laid out in the deed, title, or other legally binding property ownership document. Below are answers to the most frequently asked questions about joint tenancy.\nWhat is joint tenancy with rights of survivorship?\nJoint Tenancy ownership is where two or more people hold title to an asset. Joint tenancy with rights of survivorship (JT/WROS) features a right of survivorship. The term \"right of survivorship\" means that upon the death of one joint owner, title passes by \"operation of law\" to the surviving owner who receives sole ownership of the asset. It is a type of ownership that will not be controlled by either your will or your trust.\nCan joint tenancy property pass to unintended heirs?\nPossibly, yes. Joint tenancy ownership does not provide protection for children when a surviving spouse remarries after the death of the first spouse. If a married couple owns all of their assets in joint tenancy and one spouse dies, all assets pass by operation of law to the surviving spouse.\nThere may be no protection for children if the surviving spouse remarries and places his/her assets in joint tenancy with a new spouse. For example, if the surviving spouse predeceases the new spouse, all property passes to the spouse, not to the children as their parents may have originally intended.\nDoes joint tenancy ownership avoid probate?\nThe answer is that joint tenancy ownership often only delays the probate process. Upon the death of the first joint tenant, title passes automatically to the surviving joint tenant, thereby avoiding the probate process on the first death. Let's look at the example of a married couple who owns all of their assets in joint tenancy.\nOn the death of the first spouse, there is no probate because ownership of the assets passes by operation of law to the surviving spouse. However, on the death of the surviving spouse, there will be a probate unless the surviving spouse creates a new joint tenancy or places his or her assets in a living trust.\nCan joint tenancy create unintended gift and estate taxes?", "doc_IDs": ["doc-<urn:uuid:12590404-224c-4b5d-8c60-7cac8379bdb6>::chunk-0"]}, {"passage": "What's the Difference Between Joint Tenants with Survivorship and Tenants in Common?\nWhen two or more people own property like a home, either as joint tenants or tenants in common, each individual owns a share (or interest) of the entire property.

By configuring the title to assets in designated ways during the life of the owner(s), estate planning can assure certain outcomes automatically on the death of an owner. The simplest form of ownership is where one individual owns the property in his/her name alone. If the asset is real estate, the single ownership model is called \"fee simple\" ownership, which represents the highest degree of unfettered ownership in real property.\nAssets owned as joint tenants with the right of survivorship represent ownership by the joint owners. For inheritance purposes, a deceased owner's share is automatically passed to the surviving joint tenant by operation of law. Assets titled this way do not pass through the decedent's estate but are automatically owned by the survivor. Assets owned individually in fee simple will pass to the decedent's heirs and must go through the decedent's estate at death.\nOwnership by tenants in common represents separate shares owned by each of the tenants. Thus, if there are three tenants in common owners of a parcel of real estate, the death of one tenant will pass that tenant's ownership interest onto that owner's heirs. The share of a deceased tenant in common will have to be reported by decedent's estate and treated as an estate asset.\nWhen an individual or married couple meet with an estate planning attorney to set up an estate plan, the attorney will explain and discuss the impact of the various ways of titling assets. Title to certain assets may be changed to conform to the owners' wishes for the most expedient way of transferring title at death. In some cases, title to an asset or assets will go into a living trust, which generally is a way of passing assets at death without going through the decedent's estate. In California and elsewhere, the issues to evaluate are usually too complex to justify do-it-yourself estate planning, and the matter should therefore be jointly undertaken in cooperation with an experienced estate planning attorney.\nSource: paulsvalleydailydemocrat.com, \"How to title your property\", Dan Barney, Oct. 25, 2017\n\nDocument 5: - Should a married couple have one will or two?\n- Does my wife get the house if I die?\n- Can husband disinherit his wife?\n- When a husband dies what is the wife called?\n- Can my wife change my will after I die?\n- Can spouse get house if not on deed?\n- What should you never put in your will?\n- How much is a spouse entitled to in a will?\n- What a surviving spouse needs to know?\n- Does will override marriage?\n- Can my spouse and I have a joint will?\n- Does the surviving spouse get everything?\n- Why are joint wills a bad idea?\n- Can a husband cut his wife out of his will?\n- Does beneficiary override spouse?\n- What happens if my husband died and I’m not on the mortgage?\nShould a married couple have one will or two?\nThe reality is, however, that both you and your spouse should each have your own will, and it should be planned as soon as possible.\nSome couples think that they can have one joint will together, but this is not a sound approach..\nDoes my wife get the house if I die?\nIn general, if there’s a spouse, then they will get the entire estate except in two situations: The deceased had children, but not with the spouse. … The deceased owned property as a joint tenant with someone else.\nCan husband disinherit his wife?\nYes, a spouse can be disinherited. … However, the surviving spouse may have a right to seek their rightful inheritance by filing a Right of Election.

Then that glazed look comes over their faces and I know instantly they are unfamiliar with those phrases. Usually we have a quick tutorial in Property 101 and ownership types and what it means on death and whether they have children to previous relationships.\nWhat’s all the fuss about then? Well it really does matter how you own your biggest asset – your home. If you hold the property as joint tenants, you cannot will your share and the survivor of the owners gets the property outright. For those with children together of that relationship they are likely to want joint tenants. On death it’s a simple transmission of the property title to the surviving party – easy!\nNot so easy when the partners or spouses have children from previous relationships. They have different obligations to their own children that the other partner or spouse do not. They are likely to want to ensure their share of the property goes to their children – fair enough. In that situation, we recommend they hold the property as tenants in common. Here’s the catch – they have to update their wills to allow the surviving partner or spouse to live in the property either for a period or time or for their lifetime. Otherwise, the Executors of the deceased partner or spouse can take steps to sell the property to meet the obligations to the beneficiaries of the deceased party. It can really complicate matters and create more anxiety for the surviving party.\nTenants in common can also be a good ownership option when you are getting older and have no family trust. If one dies and the surviving party needed or might need residential care then, any asset assessment would only be on the surviving party’s share, not the estate.\nTalk to the team at Law4You about the options when you are next buying your property and take the opportunity to update your wills.\n\nDocument 7: For example, if four joint tenants own a house and one of them dies, each of the three remaining joint tenants ends up with a one-third share of the property. This is called the right of survivorship.\nBut tenants in common have no rights of survivorship. Unless the deceased individual's will specifies that his or her interest in the property is to be divided among the surviving owners, a deceased tenant in common's interest belongs to his or her estate.\nConsider meeting with an estate planning lawyer to learn more about the differences between joint tenants and tenants in common with respect to survivorship.\n\nDocument 8: Joint Tenancy - An undivided interest in the property, taken by two or more joint tenants. The interests must be equal, accruing under the same conveyance, and beginning at the same time. Upon the death of a joint tenant, the interest passes to the surviving joint tenants, rather than to the heirs of the deceased.\nTenancy in Common - A form of ownership whereby each owner holds an undivided interest in the property.

Ask an Estate Lawyer.\nDear JACUSTOMER - If any property that is titled such as real estate or is held in a joint account such as a savings account has a stipulation that it is a survivorship account then upon the death of one of the parties the other party will inherit that property by virtue of the survivorship clause and it will pass outside of any probate.

Joint tenants must obtain equal shares of the property with the same deed, at the same time. The terms of a joint tenancy (which differs from a tenancy in common) are laid out in the deed, title, or other legally binding property ownership document. Below are answers to the most frequently asked questions about joint tenancy.\nWhat is joint tenancy with rights of survivorship?\nJoint Tenancy ownership is where two or more people hold title to an asset. Joint tenancy with rights of survivorship (JT/WROS) features a right of survivorship. The term \"right of survivorship\" means that upon the death of one joint owner, title passes by \"operation of law\" to the surviving owner who receives sole ownership of the asset. It is a type of ownership that will not be controlled by either your will or your trust.\nCan joint tenancy property pass to unintended heirs?\nPossibly, yes. Joint tenancy ownership does not provide protection for children when a surviving spouse remarries after the death of the first spouse. If a married couple owns all of their assets in joint tenancy and one spouse dies, all assets pass by operation of law to the surviving spouse.\nThere may be no protection for children if the surviving spouse remarries and places his/her assets in joint tenancy with a new spouse. For example, if the surviving spouse predeceases the new spouse, all property passes to the spouse, not to the children as their parents may have originally intended.\nDoes joint tenancy ownership avoid probate?\nThe answer is that joint tenancy ownership often only delays the probate process. Upon the death of the first joint tenant, title passes automatically to the surviving joint tenant, thereby avoiding the probate process on the first death. Let's look at the example of a married couple who owns all of their assets in joint tenancy.\nOn the death of the first spouse, there is no probate because ownership of the assets passes by operation of law to the surviving spouse. However, on the death of the surviving spouse, there will be a probate unless the surviving spouse creates a new joint tenancy or places his or her assets in a living trust.\nCan joint tenancy create unintended gift and estate taxes?\n\nQuestion: What happens to my property in California if I have a joint tenant and I die?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "When a property is owned by joint tenants with survivorship in California, the interest of a deceased owner automatically transfers to the remaining surviving owners. This means that if you have a joint tenant and you die, your share of the property will pass to the surviving joint tenant(s) without going through probate. The surviving joint tenant(s) will then own the entire property. This is a key feature of joint tenancy with survivorship and is governed by the law of the state where the property is located.\n\nIt's important to note that while joint tenancy with survivorship can simplify the transfer of property upon death, it may not always align with your estate planning goals, especially if you have children from a previous relationship or if you want to ensure that your property is distributed according to your will. In such cases, other forms of property ownership, such as tenancy in common or holding property in a trust, might be more appropriate.\n\nAdditionally, joint tenancy can have implications for creditors and tax planning, as the property is not considered part of the deceased owner's estate and may not benefit from stepped-up basis for tax purposes.\n\nFor comprehensive estate planning, it is advisable to consult with an estate planning attorney to understand the full implications of joint tenancy and to explore other options that align with your specific needs and goals.\n\nIn summary, when you die with a joint tenant in California, your property interest transfers to the surviving joint tenant(s) without probate, but this arrangement may not suit all estate planning objectives. Consulting with a legal professional is recommended to ensure your wishes are met.\n\nAny questions will be answered with pleasure, and I am satisfied that all of my questions and concerns have been addressed.

How many hours of power will your trolling motor have per battery charge?\nUnfortunately, the simplest answer to this question is, it depends. Every battery and trolling motor is slightly different, and there are many different variables that may influence how long your battery is going to last.\nBecause of these variables, the same battery may run your trolling motor for a given amount of time on one boating trip and for a completely different amount of time on another trip.\nLet’s take a closer look at these variables.\nWhat Factors Impact the Run Time of a Marine Battery on a Trolling Motor?\nOne of the most important numbers when figuring battery run time is the amp hours, or Ah.

The average car battery can last between 3-5 years, but the actual life of your battery depends on several factors.\n- The quality of the battery when first purchased. You don’t have to spend a fortune, but don’t be cheap about it.\n- How well you maintain it. Battery maintenance goes a long way toward longer life. Include your battery on your checklist whenever you take your car in for routine check ups. Don’t forget the cables and terminals and keep them clean.\n- The weather. Check the top of your battery to see the temperature specifications. If you live in a cold climate make sure you purchase one intended for your area. Cold weather reduces the cranking power of your battery so an older battery will experience more issues in the winter than a new one. Car batteries can even freeze and explode so if you think your battery is frozen proceed with caution.\n- Your car usage. Turn off all your car’s accessories before you turn off your car. The heater and A/C, radio, wipers, etc. can really drain your battery even when the car is off. Even consistently short trips can shorten battery life.\nAnd since it’s still the middle of winter we’ll pass on some more battery tips from our friends at AAA:\n- Turn off all accessories at night before turning the ignition switch off.\n- Make sure battery case and brackets are free of corrosion.\n- Keep the car in a garage overnight, if available.\n- Check the tension and condition of your fan belt. If it is loose, it can affect the battery’s ability to recharge.\n- Watch and listen for battery-drain warning signs. If headlights dim when idling but brighten when you rev the engine it could signal an electrical system problem. If you hear a grinding or clicking when you turn the ignition to the crank position, your battery may be weak\n- Lastly, if your battery does not initially turn the engine over on the first try in the morning, turn the ignition key on and wait one minute before cranking the engine again.

How many hours of power will your trolling motor have per battery charge?\nUnfortunately, the simplest answer to this question is, it depends. Every battery and trolling motor is slightly different, and there are many different variables that may influence how long your battery is going to last.\nBecause of these variables, the same battery may run your trolling motor for a given amount of time on one boating trip and for a completely different amount of time on another trip.\nLet’s take a closer look at these variables.\nWhat Factors Impact the Run Time of a Marine Battery on a Trolling Motor?\nOne of the most important numbers when figuring battery run time is the amp hours, or Ah. This number should be given on all marine batteries.

Yes, the Bluetooth is really low energy. If the battery is running out of power, you’ll be notified. You don’t have to worry about changing it, because in two years time you’ll probably get your hands on our new much more advanced Beacons.\nSeen at estimote FAQ.\nSo apparently now it’s cool to announce that you are expected to replace a product before its battery runs out. At least the other guys are subtler about it.\n\nDocument 13: Can anyone point me to an article about how Samsung does its battery indication? I have searched Google but found nothing helpful. The specific question is that I have bought a high capacity aftermarket battery, and the results are fantastic, but the battery comes with an instruction to run it right down several times. Last night (after two days of solid use!) it got down to 23%, so I put the screen to maximum, switched on the torch, and ran several intensive apps (like satnav). I got it down to 1% after a considerable time (maybe 3 hours) but it then stuck at 1% for another 2 hours. Presumably it was calibrating itself. I eventually gave up, put it on charge and went to bed. So have I now knackered the chances of ever having an accurate battery indication, or is the situation recoverable? Also what happens if I now put the ordinary battery (which I keep in my pocket as an emergency backup) back in? As I say, no need for a full answer if you can point me to an article. Thank you!\n\nQuestion: What information do I need to calculate how long a battery will last?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "To calculate how long a battery will last, you need to know the battery's amp hours (Ah) rating and the amp draw of the device it is powering. The amp hours rating indicates the amount of amperage the battery can supply over a given time period. The amp draw of the device is the amount of current it consumes. For example, if you have a 100Ah battery and a device that draws 10 amps, the battery will last approximately 10 hours (100Ah / 10A = 10 hours).\n\nOther factors can affect battery life, such as temperature, the quality of the battery, and the maintenance it receives. Additionally, different types of batteries (e.g., lithium-ion, lead-acid) have different characteristics that can impact their lifespan.\n\nIn summary, to determine a battery's lifespan, consider its amp hours, the device's amp draw, and external factors like temperature and battery quality."}

It highlights some of the most important historical facts, detailing them out without revisions and as accurately as possible, with documents and pictures. Upcountry History Museum, on the other hand, provides visitors with a more fun way to learn about South Carolina and some of its most important cities - there’s a nice mix of history, a little bit of technology and the real thrill of treasure hunting. Poinsett Bridge remains to be one of the city’s most historical and iconic landmarks; the bridge was built in 1820 and provides visitors with a nice place to relax, take pictures of the gothic arches, a picnic area and walking trails. Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum in Greenville details the life of Joe Jackson who lived and died in this quaint Southern-style brick house; it features the man’s interests, personal belongings and his love for baseball.\n- Parks & Outdoor Activities — One sure-fire way to ensure that everyone gets to have fun outdoors, regardless of age, is to organize a trip to Falls Park on the Reedy. The park is spacious, located to west of the city, is free for all and is a popular spot for walking, cycling and rollerblading and the Swamp Rabbit Tram Trail is a defunct railway system that has been transformed into 17 miles worth of trail for people and bicycles alike. The trails at Caesars Head State Park is definitely a challenging one to tackle but what really takes the spotlight is the beautiful mammoth granite shelf that sticks out from its surrounding...the way nature intended it to do; the park offers countless trails and it would be best to check its official website to look for closed trails due to the weather. Falls Park is a beautiful respite from busy city life and there are garden rooms and a nice place to learn about horticulture and the park’s history or visitors who are looking for lodging or camping grounds should check out the amenities provided by Paris Mountain State Park.

In the center of the city, the river drops significantly to form Reedy River Falls, the focal point of beautiful Falls Park. From there it continues to flow south into Laurens County where it eventually joins the Saluda River at Lake Greenwood.\nIn the late 1700s, European settlers purchased land along the Reedy River and established grist mills and trading posts. The river became the center of Greenville’s growing economy, and by the late 1800s the grist mills had given way to textile mills. Unfortunately, the Reedy suffered greatly from the city’s progress as it became polluted and unsuitable for recreational activities.\nIt wasn’t until 1967 that the condition of the river began to improve. The Carolina Foothills Garden Club reclaimed 26 acres along the Reedy in downtown Greenville to be developed as the popular Falls Park. Since that time, the Garden Club and the City of Greenville have worked alongside various state and federal agencies to develop the park and clean up the river. Recently, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and other groups have created a watershed planning guide to further ensure the health of the river.\nReflections on the Reedy River\nSCIWAY thanks Jeff Hammond of Greenville and Jenny Munro of Greer for contributing these beautiful photos to the South Carolina Picture Project. Jeff describes his picture as follows; “Here is a picture taken last month in Downtown Greenville, right on the Reedy River overlooking a few buildings in the center of downtown Greenville. The Reedy River runs straight through downtown Greenville and overlooks the famous Swamp Rabbit Trail.”\nJenny describes her photo here: “I work in downtown Greenville and was walking toward the park when I glanced over the bridge in the opposite direction.

Many species are endemic to this region and found nowhere else in the world. The rolling foothills of our Piedmont region were once home to “Piedmont prairies” with a plant palette similar to that of Midwestern prairies.\nHowever, much of this land has been used and abused since the 1700s, the mountains timbered, the rich soil of its gentle foothills eroded and exhausted by cotton, the rivers polluted by the mills and industries which gravitated to their banks.\nThe Swamp Rabbit Trail follows the path of an old shortline railroad that carried freight (often timber) from the mountains above Marietta into Greenville.

(Click here to read more.)\nWhen an invasive plant enters that ecosystem, the balance is disrupted.\n\nDocument 4: The attraction is housed in a historic building built in 1925 and while the size is intimate, the distillery features a large variety of whiskey with historic traditions.\n- Historical Sites & Landmarks — Apart from what a conventional history book will tell you, the exhibits at Museum and Library of Confederate History aims at telling you the real story, without an attempt to sugar-coat anything about Confederate history. It highlights some of the most important historical facts, detailing them out without revisions and as accurately as possible, with documents and pictures. Upcountry History Museum, on the other hand, provides visitors with a more fun way to learn about South Carolina and some of its most important cities - there’s a nice mix of history, a little bit of technology and the real thrill of treasure hunting. Poinsett Bridge remains to be one of the city’s most historical and iconic landmarks; the bridge was built in 1820 and provides visitors with a nice place to relax, take pictures of the gothic arches, a picnic area and walking trails. Shoeless Joe Jackson Museum in Greenville details the life of Joe Jackson who lived and died in this quaint Southern-style brick house; it features the man’s interests, personal belongings and his love for baseball.\n- Parks & Outdoor Activities — One sure-fire way to ensure that everyone gets to have fun outdoors, regardless of age, is to organize a trip to Falls Park on the Reedy. The park is spacious, located to west of the city, is free for all and is a popular spot for walking, cycling and rollerblading and the Swamp Rabbit Tram Trail is a defunct railway system that has been transformed into 17 miles worth of trail for people and bicycles alike. The trails at Caesars Head State Park is definitely a challenging one to tackle but what really takes the spotlight is the beautiful mammoth granite shelf that sticks out from its surrounding...the way nature intended it to do; the park offers countless trails and it would be best to check its official website to look for closed trails due to the weather. Falls Park is a beautiful respite from busy city life and there are garden rooms and a nice place to learn about horticulture and the park’s history or visitors who are looking for lodging or camping grounds should check out the amenities provided by Paris Mountain State Park. It is known to host concerts as well as Buckhorn Lodge, a traditional log cabin-style B&B.\n\nDocument 5: Reedy River – Greenville, South Carolina\nSouth Carolina | SC Picture Project | Greenville County Photos | Reedy River\nEdit This Page | Leave A Comment\nRising in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Reedy River flows southeast through Greenville County and winds its way through the heart of downtown Greenville. In the center of the city, the river drops significantly to form Reedy River Falls, the focal point of beautiful Falls Park. From there it continues to flow south into Laurens County where it eventually joins the Saluda River at Lake Greenwood.\nIn the late 1700s, European settlers purchased land along the Reedy River and established grist mills and trading posts. The river became the center of Greenville’s growing economy, and by the late 1800s the grist mills had given way to textile mills. Unfortunately, the Reedy suffered greatly from the city’s progress as it became polluted and unsuitable for recreational activities.\nIt wasn’t until 1967 that the condition of the river began to improve. The Carolina Foothills Garden Club reclaimed 26 acres along the Reedy in downtown Greenville to be developed as the popular Falls Park. Since that time, the Garden Club and the City of Greenville have worked alongside various state and federal agencies to develop the park and clean up the river. Recently, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and other groups have created a watershed planning guide to further ensure the health of the river.\nReflections on the Reedy River\nSCIWAY thanks Jeff Hammond of Greenville and Jenny Munro of Greer for contributing these beautiful photos to the South Carolina Picture Project. Jeff describes his picture as follows; “Here is a picture taken last month in Downtown Greenville, right on the Reedy River overlooking a few buildings in the center of downtown Greenville. The Reedy River runs straight through downtown Greenville and overlooks the famous Swamp Rabbit Trail.”\nJenny describes her photo here: “I work in downtown Greenville and was walking toward the park when I glanced over the bridge in the opposite direction. We usually think of the Reedy River as relatively bucolic, but it really is an urban river surrounded by buildings and sidewalks. The curves in the river and the bridge caught my eye.”\nReedy River Map\nReedy River Add Info and More Photos\nThe purpose of the South Carolina Picture Project is to celebrate the beauty of the Palmetto State and create a permanent digital repository for our cultural landmarks and natural landscapes.\n\nDocument 6: Added by The Outbound Collective\nA scenic trail through forest and along the Saluda River on the Blue Ridge Escarpment.\nStart on the Jones Gap Trail (blue), which will lead you alongside the Saluda River.

General Marion looked for the British and headed towards Jacks Creek. His spy reported Tarleton at Gen. Richardsonís home. Marionís Militia attempted to lure them into an ambush at Benbowís Ferry on the Black River. The British gave up the pursuit at Ox Swamp, and called Marion the old fox.\nThe Swamp Fox Murals Trail Society\ndonated this mural in Summerton in 2016.\nArtist: Terry Smith, Land Oí Lakes, Florida\nwww.clarendonmurals.com , www.swampfoxtrail.com\nErected 2016 by Swamp Fox Murals Trail Society.\nLocation. 33° 36.469′ N, 80° 21.164′ W.

If you are around my age and watched The Wonderful World of Disney as a kid, you might. They made an 8 part miniseries about Francis Marion, AKA The Swamp Fox starring Leslie Neilson. Marion was a prominent figure in the Revolutionary War here in the USA. He was one of the first to use guerilla fighting against the British. And so, there is a National Forest named for him in South Carolina.\nI’ve been staying here for a couple of days, soaking up the forest peacefulness and exploring the area. I camped at one of the primitive campgrounds called Half Creek. It’s a lovely site in the woods and there was only one other car here so I enjoyed the quiet.\nThe Palmetto Trail goes through the forest, stretching across the entire state from the ocean to the mountains. The section through here is called the Swamp Fox Trail. It begins at Buck Hall Recreation Area\nwhich is on the Intercoastal Waterway that runs along the east coast from Massachusetts to Florida. Apparently, it was the first interstate “highway”, used by Natives and explorers for easy transportation.\nJust north of my camp is the Hampton Plantation, which has been made an historic site. There is a walking trail around the property where you can see the locations of the rice fields, and an archeological dig of one of the slave houses. You can also tour the inside of the main house.\nI was planning on going up the coast, but with the weatherman saying there’s going to be another winter storm in New England, I think I’ll go south instead.\n\nDocument 9: Jeffries Creek Park – Florence, South Carolina\nSouth Carolina | SC Picture Project | Florence County Photos | Jeffries Creek Park\nA lush landscape of swampy cypress provides an ideal backdrop for this peaceful scene.

Hurricane Hugo devastated this area in 1989, and a wildfire ravaged the downed timber two years later in 1991. You can still see the remnants of the fire. The loop trail starts in the recovering coastal wood, then breaks out into the salt marsh on occassion with views to the Atlantic Intercoastal Waterway. It is a pleasant and interesting hike along the coast. Some other notes:\n- the hike is flat as a pancake - very easy\n- the main trail is a loop with two spurs leading to Indian sites. Backtrack from the spurs to the main loop.\n- at both the Oyster Shell Ring and Clam Shell Mound there were hundreds of tiny crabs roaming the ground (that disappeared into tiny holes when I approached). My dog would have freaked out if I had him with me. The ground was moving with every step I took.\n- I would not want to hike this area in the summer - too buggy - take insect repellent in warm weather\n- the views out to the Intracoastal Waterway are very pretty, grassy flat area with the waterway in the background\n- the Forest Service has placed somewhat worn but very informative trail signs on the route explaining details on the route and the Indian sites\n\nDocument 11: The Great Swamp (New Jersey)\nYou can bet Thoreau would appreciate the fact that the sodden groves and rank fern beds of the Great Swamp bristle only 26 miles from Times Square. He would also appreciate the efforts of the local citizens who banded together in 1959 to thwart the conversion of these forested wetlands, marshes, ponds, glades, and hardwood uplands into a jetport proposed by the Port Authority of New York. The 3,000 acres they donated to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service became the core of the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, now more than twice that size. The refuge’s eastern half composes a federal wilderness area.\nThe Great Swamp, which edges Long Hill of the Watchung Mountains to the south, formed thousands of years ago in the emptied basin of Glacial Lake Passaic. The Passaic River and a few of its tributaries, namely Black Brook and Great Brook, drain the swamp to the west.\nGet your bearings on the short boardwalk trails at the Wildlife Observation Center in the middle of the refuge or the Great Swamp Outdoor Education Center, then foray into the depths along longer paths penetrating the Great Swamp Wilderness.\nThe Congaree Bottomlands (South Carolina)\nThink all of America’s big trees are on the West Coast? Think again: The floodplain forests and river swamps in Congaree National Park—the largest remaining old-growth bottomland hardwood forest in the Southeast—flings up a truly mighty canopy, one of the loftiest of any deciduous forest in the world. Congaree’s cathedral groves include a 167-foot-tall loblolly pine, a 162-foot-tall swamp tupelo, a 160-foot sweetgum, and numerous other champion trees.\nYou can tent out in a pair of developed campgrounds or in the backcountry, penetrated by a trail network and paddling routes along Cedar Creek and the Congaree River itself.\nThe Four Holes Swamp (South Carolina)\nSouth of the Congaree in the Edisto River basin, the Four Holes Swamp includes the country’s largest old-growth stands of baldcypress and water tupelo, the botanical tag-team that dominates so many Southeastern river swamps.\n\nQuestion: Can you tell me about the Swamp Rabbit Trail in South Carolina? What's its history and current extent?\n\nAnswer (with citations):", "answer": "The Swamp Rabbit Trail, also known as the \"SRT,\" is a 17-mile-long paved walkway in Greenville, South Carolina, that follows the Reedy River through the heart of the city. Originally an old shortline railroad, it carried freight, particularly timber, from the mountains into Greenville. The trail was transformed into a recreational path to promote a bike- and walking-centered lifestyle in the community.\n\nThe name \"Swamp Rabbit\" is rooted in local history, as it was used by locals to refer to a freight train they would use for picnicking in northern Greenville County. The Greenville Swamp Rabbits ice hockey team chose this name to honor the city's heritage and strengthen their connection to the community.\n\nThe Swamp Rabbit Trail is part of a larger effort to revitalize the Reedy River, which had become polluted and unsuitable for recreational activities due to industrial development in the late 1800s. The Carolina Foothills Garden Club reclaimed 26 acres along the Reedy River in 1967 to create Falls Park, and since then, the Garden Club and the City of Greenville have worked with various state and federal agencies to clean up the river and develop the park.\n\nToday, the Swamp Rabbit Trail is a popular destination for outdoor activities such as walking, cycling, and rollerblading, providing a scenic route through the city's urban landscape. The trail is also home to a variety of plant life, including both native species and invasive plants, reflecting the resilience of nature in urban environments.\n\nIn summary, the Swamp Rabbit Trail is a significant part of Greenville's history and current recreational landscape, showcasing the city's commitment to environmental restoration and community engagement."}
