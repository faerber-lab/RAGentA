{"question":"I'm worried about environmental issues and want to know how biochar affects carbon sequestration and what are its effects on soil pollution?","answer":"Biochar is effective for carbon sequestration, as it can sequester about 489 kg of CO2 per 1,000 kg of organic material, storing carbon in a stable form for over 1,000 years and creating a carbon sink that helps slow down climate change. Regarding pollution, biochar is capable of binding with heavy metals and chemicals from agricultural and road runoff, making it useful for environmental remediation. It can bind toxic substances like heavy metals and pesticides, which is important not only for healthy plants but also for protecting clean water and groundwater. Research by various organizations including the USDA Forest Service and Environmental Protection Agency is ongoing to better understand its effectiveness in binding with these pollutants.","context":["Estimated reading time: 3 minutes\nBiochar has been used over the years throughout the world as a soil amendment, but research on its properties and potential benefits have recently gained the attention of foresters and agricultural producers. Biochar is a stable solid, rich in carbon that is made from organic waste material or biomass that is partially combusted in the presence of limited oxygen. The qualities that make up biochar vary depending upon the material that it comes from (feedstocks; i.e., timber slash, corn stalks, manure, etc.) and the temperature at which combustion occurs. The various materials and methods to produce biochar result in a wide variety of chemical and physical properties across biochar products. To understand the properties of biochar, a user should know 1) what it was made from (i.e. the feedstock), and 2) the temperature at which it was made (i.e. 300-700C).\nA common attribute among all types of biochar is the primary ingredient: a recalcitrant carbon that can persist in soils for years or decades, and even millennia. Biochar can be used as a soil amendment by itself, or it can be blended with other soil amendments to address a wide range of environmental, agricultural, and forestry challenges. Research underway by the USDA Forest Service, USDA Agricultural Research Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, and others will provide insight into how effective biochar is at binding with heavy metals and chemicals from agricultural and road runoff for the purpose of environmental remediation. Applications of biochar include improving soil health, raising soil pH, remediating polluted soils, sequestering carbon, lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and improving soil moisture. Know your soil amendment goal(s), to determine which biochars are best to achieve your goals.\nThe Pacific Northwest Biochar Atlas is an online platform that helps users choose a biochar to suit soil health goals. In addition, the Atlas provides details about the benefits of biochar, case studies of over half a dozen example operations implementing biochar across the region, and a map of biochar producers to simplify access for interested users. These and other features of the Atlas help to improve information exchange, continuing education, and biochar accessibility for the Northwest.\nAdditional biochar resources:\nBiochar Basics: An A-Z Guide to Biochar Production, Use, and Benefits.

Biochar, however, is a special type of charcoal produced by a thermal process called pyrolysis (from the Greek, ‘pyro’, meaning fire and ‘lysis’, meaning separation). During pyrolysis organic matter such as wood waste, organic kitchen waste, rice husks, grass cuttings etc. is thermos-chemically disintegrated in an oxygen-free environment at high temperatures of between 400 °C and 900 °C. Biochar starts out as organic material and becomes more mineral-like with the heating (Wilson K 2014). The carbon sequestration achieved in the process is 489 kg CO2 per 1,000 kg of organic material (Gerber 2009), which means almost half of plant wastes’ total carbon will be permanently stored in the biochar for more than 1,000 years (Schmidt HP 2011). When incorporated into the soil CO2 is actively taken out of our atmosphere, creating a so-called ‘carbon sink’ which is able to slow down climate change.\nHans-Peter Schmidt, a biochar expert, said in an article published in the Ithaka journal (1/2012) (http://www.ithaka-journal.net):\n“The current imbalance in the world’s carbon and nitrogen cycle is not just the main cause of climate change, but also a direct threat to ecosystems through eutrophication, desertification and a decline in biodiversity. Re-balancing through regularly recycling organic material with its carbon, nitrogen and phosphor content is needed. Biochar has the potential to play a key role, as it not only converts the carbon found in a wide range of biomasses into a stable form, but also binds volatile nutrients from biomass residues, thereby recycling them for agricultural use. Though still “early days” for biochar, the prospects for its use are good, whether in crop or livestock farming, or in industry.”\nSoil and Biochar\nHealthy soil can be pictured as a living being that consists of innumerable small organisms, inorganic minerals, water, roots of plants and organic matter. Almost 90 % of all organisms on our planet are living in the soil (Schmidt HP 2010). Once natural vegetation has been removed microorganisms disappear, the soil slowly loses its natural fertility and gets depleted in nutrients. In order to still be able to grow crops, non-organic farmers add tons and tons of inorganic fertilizer, not knowing that the inorganic fertilizer kills the soil life. In order to compensate for that loss even more inorganic fertilizer is added, at high cost to the farmer and the planet – most of these fertilizers are oil- and gas-based. This is a deadly spiral, which ends in contaminated soil and groundwater often resulting in ‘badlands’ – biodiversity deserts. There is an urgent need to maintain and build healthy, living soils which keep fertility.\nSince ancient times it is known that poor soils can be significantly improved by adding biochar. In South America biochar amended soil is known as “terra preta” black soil. Scientific experiments in the Brazilian Amazon have shown that a thousand years after application of the biochar crops still grow better on biochar amended soil than on freshly cleared rainforest soil.\nBefore applying biochar to the soil it has to be “activated”, meaning it has to be loaded with nutrients and microorganisms, which can e.g. be achieved by mixing it with compost or organic fertilizer. The pyrolysis process creates thousands of microscopic holes in each piece of Biochar. One gram of Biochar could, theoretically, unfold to be the size of a soccer pitch. This extremely high surface area means that lots of microorganisms can colonise the Biochar and later colonise depleted soil; the Biochar also helps soil to retain water. Once activated/loaded Biochar is mixed into depleted top soil, or simply put on the soil surface as a top dressing ideally covered with mulch. Over time the soil will become more alive, restoring itself and getting back into its healthy natural cycle.\nSEM images of the popular bio-char (y sectional surface) after the partial gasification\nHow does Biochar modify soil?\nBiochar serves as a carrier for nutrients, water and habitat for microorganisms, all crucial for a healthy soil and healthy plants. Due to its big sponge-like surface (300 m2 per 1 g) biochar is able to store a five times higher amount of nutrients and water than its own weight (Schmidt HP 2014). All the stored nutrients are easily available for plants.\nKey facts about biochar (according to Schmidt HP 2010, 2011, 2012):\n• Biochar stores nutrients like nitrogen and prevents them from being washed away\n• Stored nutrients are easily available for plants and microorganisms. Through the stimulation of microbial symbiosis, the plant takes up the nutrients from the porous carbon structure.\n• Biochar provides habitat for microorganisms, which are crucial in processing nutrients and building new fertile soil\n• Plant growth and plant health is improved\n• Increase of myccorhiza, so plants can access nutrients more easily\n• Biochar improves water retention and stabilizes soils\n• Biochar helps to prevent erosion and stagnant moisture and releases water through dry periods\n• Biochar improves aeration and reduces emission of climate-wrecking gases like methane or nitrous oxide\n• Biochar is capable of binding toxic substances (heavy metal, pesticides, etc) which is not only important for healthy plants but also for clean water and ground water protection\n• Biochar is raising the soil’s pH-value, again making nutrients more accessible to plants\n• Biochar reduces waste problems by recycling organic materials such as arboricultural waste, old bamboo scaffolding, old palettes, rice husks, coconut fibres, organic kitchen waste and so on – keeping them out of the landfill where they decay and release carbon into the atmosphere.\nHow is Biochar used in KFBG\nBiochar is used in KFBG to improve poor soils for organic farming, gardens and forest restoration. It helps us to reduce and recycle organic wastes.\nWe have had a small Biochar machine for several years. In July 2015 we have installed a new state-of-the-art machine, custom built in Australia, which has almost no emissions and, as it is the size of a shipping container, can handle a large volume of wood everyday if needed. As we change our abandoned, unproductive mono-crop orchards in the middle areas of KFBG, over the next two decades, we will convert all the cut wood to biochar and put this back onto the old orchard terraces, with mulch to enrich the depleted soil, ready for planting a wide range of native tree seedlings to create a healthy native forest and seed nursery.\nFurther information and links:\nSchmidt HP: Terra Preta – model of a cultural technique\nSchmidt HP: Climate Farming – A Master Plan for Sustainable Agriculture\nSchmidt HP: Biochar – a key technology for the planet\nWilson K: How biochar works in soil\nGerber H (2009): CO2-Bilanz des Pyregreaktors, Ithaka-Journal 2009, www.ithaka-journal.net/60, ISSN 1663-0521\nSchmidt HP (2010): Climate Farming – A Master Plan for Sustainable Agriculture, 1/2010, S.314–317, www.ithaka-journal.net; Publisher: Delinat-Institut für Ökologie und Klimafarming, CH-1974 Arbaz; www.delinat-institut.org, www.ithaka-journal.net.

{"question":"compare roles michael spyres donizetti operas candide cunegonde character singing requirements","answer":"In Donizetti's operas on Michael Spyres' album, the tenor roles require a versatile instrument capable of both lyrical and dramatic singing, as demonstrated in works like 'L'elisir d'amore' and 'Lucia di Lammermoor'. In contrast, the role of Cunégonde in Bernstein's 'Candide' requires a lyric/coloratura soprano with a wide singing range and lots of high notes, demanding significant stamina and well-trained vocal technique, as described by performer Megan King who sang the famous aria 'Glitter and Be Gay'.","context":["Usually despatched in 2 - 3 working days. (Available now to download.)\n“Michael Spyres has a lovely, liquid tenor, all honey for love duets and some metal for cries of outraged honor.” John Yohalem, from Opera Today\nYou may well be hard-pressed to name a classic opera that lacks a love-story – or a tenor as the main romantic hero. Accordingly, emerging American tenor Michael Spyres has come up with a fresh and fascinating pretext for A Fool for Love: his new collection of tenor arias on Delos.\nMichael has carefully selected thirteen mostly well-known arias by composers ranging from Mozart to Stravinsky, encompassing a staggering array of love-related circumstances and emotions. He then sequenced them so as to tell the love-story of a single romantic protagonist. The album’s booklet contains a two-act “plot synopsis,” in which each segment of our hero’s story is indexed to the corresponding aria.\nAs Michael puts it in his booklet introduction, “What I seek to present to you in this album is a fanciful musical story of a typical war-torn couple, and their struggle to cope with the raptures and ravages of this intangible enigma called love.”\nMichael, a Missouri native, completed his studies at the Vienna Conservatory, and is already well-known to European audiences for his critically-acclaimed work in recital, oratorio, and opera. He has appeared at such distinguished houses as Milan’s La Scala and Deutsche Oper Berlin, and worked with conductors like Ricardo Muti and John Eliot Gardner.\nBlessed with a supremely versatile instrument, Michael has successfully performed the music of composers from Bach to Wagner, encompassing music of many periods and styles: Baroque, Classical, Bel Canto, and Verismo. He has recorded Rossini’s La Gazzetta, Otello, and Le Siège de Corinthe for Naxos.\nGaetano Donizetti: La fille du regiment\nLa fille du regiment, Act II: Cavatine: Ah! mes amis, quel jour defete … Pour mon ame\nIgor Stravinsky: The Rake's Progress\nThe Rake's Progress, Act I: Recitative: Here I stand …\nGioachino Rossini: Il barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville)\nIl barbiere di Siviglia (The Barber of Seville), Act II: Aria: Cessa di piu resistere\nGaetano Donizetti: L'elisir d'amore (The Elixir of Love)\nL'elisir d'amore (The Elixir of Love), Act III: Una furtiva lagrima\nWolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Don Giovanni, K. 527\nDon Giovanni, K. 527, Act II: Aria: Il mio tesoro intanto\nGeorges Bizet: Les pecheurs de perles (The Pearl Fishers)\nLes pecheurs de perles (The Pearl Fishers), Act I: Je crois entendre encore, cache sous les palmiers\nJules Massenet: Werther\nWerther, Act III: Pourquoi me reveiller\nRichard Strauss: Der Rosenkavalier, Op. 59, TrV 227\nDer Rosenkavalier, Op. 59, TrV 227, Act I: Di rigori armato il seno\nGiacomo Puccini: La boheme\nLa boheme, Act I: Che gelida manina\nGiuseppe Verdi: Rigoletto\nRigoletto, Act III: La donna e mobile\nGaetano Donizetti: Lucia di Lammermoor\nLucia di Lammermoor, Act II: Lucia fra poco a te verra\nFranz Lehar: Das Land des Lachelns (The Land of Smiles)\nDas Land des Lachelns (The Land of Smiles), Act II: Dein ist mein ganzes Herz!\n“The voice itself is that of a lyric tenor with a bit of beef when needed.

Popular culture is obsessed with wealth and celebrity; political and corporate depravity rule the day. Even a cockeyed optimist would be disillusioned in this “best of all possible worlds.”\nLeonard Bernstein’s “Candide” suggests that we make the best of what we have. Yes, real life is cruel and messy — but consider the alternative.\nIn that sense, “Candide” makes perfect sense for Mobile Opera, which will have performances Oct. 22 and Oct. 24 at the Saenger Theatre in downtown Mobile.\n“I’m just really thrilled that we’re opening with something like this,” says D. Scott Wright, newly named general director for the company. “‘Candide’ is just nuts. I think it’s bright and the satire is witty. If you try to make sense of it in a traditional operatic way, then you’re going to be lost. But if you just kind of go with the flow, I think it’s a real good time.”\nThe operetta is one of Bernstein’s most complex works, says Andy Anderson, artistic director of Mobile Opera.\n“It’s the polar opposite of ‘West Side Story.’ It’s very dense musically — you go from incredibly thick orchestration to chamber music.\n“The music describes Bernstein’s personality perfectly: comical, serious, whimsical. Everything that Bernstein was. Some of it’s a little raunchy. It’s almost autobiographical. Maybe that’s why he kept revising it throughout his life. He kept adding a new part of his personality into his music.”\nAnderson will conduct an orchestra of perhaps 35 musicians and a 50-member chorus in the semi-staged production. Mobile Opera took much the same approach in last season’s successful “Sweeney Todd.” Anderson says “Candide” plays well as a concert.\n“You don’t have the confusion of locale,” he says. “It simplifies things and makes it easier to understand.”\nBernstein’s operetta is based on the 1759 satire by the French philosopher Voltaire, whose picaresque opus was banned as blasphemous, seditious and intellectually hostile. The musical was first produced Dec. 1, 1956, at the Martin Beck Theatre in New York, with Robert Rounseville as Candide, Max Adrian as Pangloss, Barbara Cook as Cunégonde, Louis Edmonds as Maximilian, and Irra Petina as the Old Lady.\nA revised one-act version by Hugh Wheeler and Stephen Sondheim opened Dec. 19, 1973, at the Chelsea Theatre Centre in Brooklyn. (Source: www.theatrehistory.com/american/candide)\nTransplanted New Yorker Paul Houghtaling, assistant professor of music and director of opera at the University of Alabama, will pull double duty in this staging of “Candide,” as stage director and performer. He will sing the role of Maximilian, the title character’s vain older brother.\nHe sang the role 22 years ago for Oswego Opera in upstate New York, and his appearance in Mobile will be his second performance.\n“It feels like a brand new show,” he says.\nDon’t be deceived or misled by the “semi-staged” label. Despite the lack of sets and elaborate costumes, this production will be “more fully staged than semi-staged,” he says.\n“The chorus will be onstage along with the orchestra. The difference is, the chorus will still have their music in hand. The principals will be fully memorized, acting and interacting with other members of the cast.\n“For us, it means I will dare the audience to even realize there is no set or it’s not fully costumed,” says Houghtaling. “It’s not about the sets, costumes or scenery — it’s about the music, the characters and bringing those characters to life through interaction. ... It will look like a complete operatic package onstage, even though the chorus will be holding music.”\nAnother feature of this “Candide” will be a dash of what Houghtaling describes as “local flavor” a la Gilbert and Sullivan — which means the audience can look forward to at least one Mobile-area reference from the stage.\n“That will be quite fun and special,” he says, “and it’s something that happens frequently in operetta.”\nHoughtaling describes “Candide” as “one of those hybrids — it’s not opera and it’s not musical theater. It’s sort of like ‘Sweeney Todd.’ The singing is quite operatic, very bravura singing, which is the province of opera singers. But that’s part of the mystique that has added to its lustre.\n“Is it opera? Operetta? Musical? Yes and no — it’s everything and anything you want it to be. That’s how special a place it has in the canon of American art.”\nTenor David Adams, who will sing the title role, says there are many reasons that “Candide” has endured for more than half a century.\nMobile Opera presents a staged concert of Leonard Bernstein’s operetta “Candide”\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Oct. 22 and 2:30 p.m. Oct. 24\nWhere: Saenger Theatre, downtown Mobile\nCast: David Adams, Megan King, Jake Coleman, Tommy Rowell, Paul Houghtaling, Patrick Jacobs, Aimee Riemersma, April Golliver; with the Mobile Opera Chorus.\nConductor: Andy Anderson will conduct the Mobile Symphony Orchestra\nDirector: stage direction by Paul Houghtaling\nTickets: $15, $30, $40 and $60 for adults; $10 for students\nInfo: 251-432-6772 or www.mobileopera.orgNote: Mobile Opera opens its 65th season with Bernstein’s spin on the 1759 French satire by Voltaire; conceived by playwright Lillian Hellman as a play with incidental music. Musical highlights include the “Candide” Overture, “Glitter and Be Gay” and “Make Our Garden Grow.\"\n“Apart from the fiery brilliance of both the story and the music, one element of ‘Candide’s’ survival as a work was Bernstein’s perfectionist nature,” he says. “He was never satisfied with the earlier versions, finding them either too soft on the subject or too abstract to be enjoyed by the audience. His revisions were not received well by his partners.\n“When the Scottish Opera commissioned the restored work, Bernstein was finally satisfied. What had been watered down and altered through the years was now brought to its full stature — a grand score with soaring melodies, rich orchestration, and a surprisingly timeless story.”\nMobile Opera will perform the final revision from the 1988-89 Royal Scottish Opera House version.\nAdams says that unlike other operatic/musical theater pieces, “Candide” loses none of its impact as a staged concert.\n“It is a text-driven work and the story line is beautifully written,” he says. “Also, I feel that staged concerts make it the job of the artist to create the story in the minds of the listeners, and they also encourage the listener to more fully engage the musical aspects of the piece.”\nThe role of Cunégonde will be performed by Megan King (www.megankingsoprano.com), who appeared onstage with Adams last season in Mobile Opera’s fine staging of “Sweeney Todd.” She will sing the role of Clara in the company’s production of “The Light in the Piazza” in January.\n“This is my first time performing ‘Candide’ in it’s entirety,” she says, “but I have been performing the aria ‘Glitter and Be Gay’ for many years. That aria is what first attracted me to ‘Candide.’”\nBernstein composed the music for the character as a lyric/coloratura soprano, according to King.\n“The role has a wide singing range with lots of high notes,” she says. “One must be a well-trained singer to have the stamina to sing this role.”\nTenor Tommy Rowell is a familiar face and voice for Mobile audiences who have seen him in theatrical and operatic productions from “The Crucible” and “Merry Widow” to last season’s “Flying Dutchman” and “Sweeney Todd.” For “Candide” he will perform three roles: the Governor, Vanderdendur and Prince Ragotski.\n“All three are rather base characters and each creates some obstacle in either Candide’s or Cunégonde’s journey,” he says.\n“The Governor ... takes Cunégonde, along with the Old Woman, into his protection with promises of marriage, and three years later she is still unwed. Vanderdendur (is) an exceedingly wealthy Dutchman who attempts to swindle Candide out of his fortune for a sinking boat. Prince Ragotski (is) the evil owner of a Turkish gambling parlor who enslaves Cunégonde and the Old Woman.”\nRowell says the enduring appeal of “Candide” is rooted in the concept of the “flawed journey of humanity” that people can identify with at a certain level.”\nMezzo-soprano April Golliver, currently associate professor of music and director of opera studies at Oklahoma State University, will sing the role of the Old Lady, which she sang in 2001 when she was a student at Indiana University.\n“The Old Lady is a favorite among the roles I’ve played throughout my career,” she says. “Even though she has lived a rough and dangerous life with only one buttock, she seems to find humor in everything.\n“I think the most difficult part of the Old Lady is finding the right accent for the character while making sure the audience can understand the text. At the same time, the accent must not get in the way of good vocal technique. This can be a bit tricky at times.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"long search query"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"comparison"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"novice"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d5e6c132-3135-4712-bbb0-e846a152d68f>","<urn:uuid:b937957f-6e35-4536-8d7f-6c0aebbfab55>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do protocols play in international agreements, and how do immunity considerations affect their enforcement?","answer":"Protocols are international treaties or agreements that complement or amend previous treaties, though parties to the original agreement are not obliged to adopt them. When it comes to enforcement, protocols face immunity-related challenges as states must navigate both immunity from jurisdiction and enforcement. The enforcement process typically requires recognition and declaration of enforceability by domestic courts prior to actual enforcement measures, and even then, state assets may be protected by immunity if they serve governmental purposes. This creates a complex situation where even if a protocol is in place, its enforcement may be limited by sovereign immunity protections.","context":["The distinctions concern in the first place their type of authorization. Contracts require the deliberation and approval of two-thirds of the senators present, but only executive agreements can be executed by the president alone. Some contracts give the President the power to fill in the gaps through executive agreements and not through additional contracts or protocols. Finally, agreements between Congress and the executive branch require a majority of the House of Representatives and the Senate before or after the president signed the treaty. an agreement between two or more countries or persons that gives them power or influence See the article on the Bricker Amendment for the history of the relationship between contractual powers and constitutional provisions. A treaty is a formal and binding written agreement concluded by actors of international law, usually sovereign states and international organizations, but also individuals and other actors.  A treaty may also be designated, inter alia, as an international agreement, protocol, pact, convention, pact or exchange of letters. Regardless of the terminology, only instruments binding on the parties are considered treaties under international law.  A treaty is legally binding.\nFormally, the opportunity for a country to formally join a group of countries or accept an agreement In a few rare cases, such as with Ethiopia and China of the Qing Dynasty, local governments have been able to use treaties to at least mitigate the effects of European colonization. This included learning the intricacies of European diplomatic practices, and then using treaties to prevent power from exceeding its agreement or by putting different powers in competition. [Citation required] There are several reasons why an otherwise valid and agreed treaty can be rejected as a binding international agreement, most of which raise problems related to the constitution of the treaty. [Citation required] For example, the Japanese-Korean series treaties of 1905, 1907 and 1910 were protested;  and the 1965 Treaty on Fundamental Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea confirmed them as “already null and void.”  The end of the preamble and the beginning of the agreement itself are often indicated by the words “agreed as follows”. In other cases, such as New Zealand with the Māori and Canada with its First Nations, treaties allowed Indigenous peoples to retain a minimum of autonomy. Such treaties between colonizers and indigenous peoples are an important part of the political discourse in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, the treaties discussed have an international reputation, as a study of the United Nations treaty found.   In international law and international relations, a protocol is generally an international treaty or agreement that complements an earlier treaty or international agreement. A protocol may amend the previous contract or add additional provisions. The parties to the previous agreement are not obliged to adopt the protocol. This is sometimes clearer by referring to it as an “optional protocol”, especially when many parties to the first agreement do not support the protocol.\nBilateral agreements are concluded between two States or entities.  It is possible for a bilateral treaty to have more than two parties; Thus, each of the bilateral treaties between Switzerland and the European Union (EU) has seventeen parts: the parties are divided into two groups, the Swiss (“on the one hand”) and the EU and its member states (“on the other”).","Whenever litigating against states or sovereign entities – or international organisations for that matter – outside of their home jurisdiction there is a roadblock to consider: immunities. On closer inspection, immunities turn out as two roadblocks: immunity from jurisdiction and immunity from enforcement. Whereas the general assumption is that an agreement to arbitrate waives immunity from jurisdiction, immunity from enforcement is a common obstacle to cashing in on an award (as demonstrated by the struggles many investors faced trying to enforce awards in the Argentinian cases or the lengthy collection battle in Walter Bau v. Thailand).\nThe issue is rarely if ever mentioned in the recent discussions on investor-state dispute settlement reform, let alone in the intra-EU BIT debate. In a nutshell, the European Commission’s position on intra-EU BITs assumes that its Member States consist of advanced legal systems, free from bias towards foreign litigants from other member states. This does not take into account the difficulties associated with challenging exercises of governmental authority such as legislation within the host state, particularly for foreigners. But what if that state suddenly decides to change its legislation on remedies all together (a concern already voiced by the IBA in its 2015 fact-correcting statement on ISDS)? In an integrated European legal system, could the disappointed investor take the case to court in the safety of her own home state?\nImmunity from Jurisdiction\nThe rationale behind immunities is the sovereign equality of states: no sovereign shall come before the courts of another (exemplified by the Latin phrase par in parem non habet imperium that equals cannot exercise power over one another). Following the doctrine of absolute immunity – as some states, e.g. China, still seem to do – immunity means exactly that. However, the majority view has shifted towards relative immunity when it comes to immunity from jurisdiction, meaning that commercial acts (acta iure gestionis) are, as a general rule, not covered, as opposed to acts through which states exercise governmental authority (acta iure imperii). But this only transposes the issue to the determination of what constitutes commercial activity. With exceptions (for a compilation of practice see here), domestic courts tend to make this call based on the nature of an act, as opposed to its purpose (contrary to immunity from enforcement, see below).\nThe 2004 United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property could provide greater clarity at the international level, including a tort exception, but is not in force. The 1972 European Convention on State Immunity is only in force in eight states: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Germany, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. This includes six EU Member States to which the potpourri of exceptions to immunity from jurisdiction applies in claims relating to each other. In all other instances, customary international law applies.\nAdditional Hurdles: Service of Process\nIrrespective of these larger questions, the issue of litigating a foreign state starts with the service of process upon it. This usually involves diplomatic channels, including both the home and the host state’s foreign ministry. This can prove time-consuming and formalistic, often requiring a strict order of hierarchical steps and translations of multiple documents. The gut instinct to attempt service on a foreign state’s embassy might easily backfire (as exemplified by the US Supreme Court case Republic of Sudan v. Harrison et al). For 76 states, the 1965 Hague Service Convention may provide guidance for the service of process from one contracting state to another. It requires the designation of Central Authorities for that purpose. However, under Article 13 a state “may refuse to comply […] if it deems that compliance would infringe its sovereignty or security”.\nAdditional Hurdles: Recognition\nOnce a decision is to be enforced in a foreign state, it must, as a general rule, be recognized and declared enforceable by the domestic courts of that state prior to actual enforcement measures such as attachment of assets. If no specific framework allowing for privileged recognition and enforcement exists, asset gathering might already fail simply because the relevant decision is not recognised or is not declared enforceable in the target state.\nThe issue of recognition and enforceability is, of course, less problematic with respect to court decisions subject to the Brussels 1a Regulation (or similar international treaties), as it would be for arbitral awards rendered under the ICSID framework or commercial awards subject to the New York Convention (or the European Convention): Pursuant to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention an ICSID award is binding on the parties and its monetary obligations are enforceable from the moment the award is rendered. Furthermore, pursuant to Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention, each contracting state must recognize and enforce an ICSID award as if it were a final judgment of its own courts. Article 54(2) then provides that the party seeking recognition and enforcement furnish a certified copy of the award to the court or other authority designated by the relevant contracting state. For states which have acceded to the New York Convention the procedure of recognition and enforcement is governed by said convention.\nImmunity from Enforcement\nYet even if the decision is recognized and accepted as an enforcement title, assets owned by foreign states (and sometimes also state-owned enterprises) can be exempt by the second roadblock that is immunity from enforcement: Whether this is the case will typically depend on the purpose for which the asset is used. Generally, those serving “governmental” activities are excluded (e.g., real estate used for diplomatic or consular purposes, including private residences, or such vehicles). Assets which are used for purely commercial activities are not immune from enforcement. Some jurisdictions require a sufficiently close connection between the claim and the forum state and immunity can also extend to “mixed use assets”. The Austrian Supreme Court held, for example, that the account of a foreign embassy with an Austrian bank that is also used for payments in relation to the performance of governmental activities is immune from enforcement measures in Austria. Article 19 of the 2004 United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property requires that the assets be within the forum state. Article 23 of the 1972 European Convention on State Immunity only allows enforcement in case of an express waiver in writing. Irrespective of applicability of this treaty, some jurisdictions require that such a waiver also be specific (as discussed on this blog and as Argentina had prominently argued in the ARA Libertad case, para 41).\nIf the investor is not able to conduct enforcement proceedings against the host state in another state due to immunities, the only path left is diplomatic protection, which is not a subjective right (although domestic legal systems may include provisions to that extent) and puts the proceedings out of the hand of the investor entirely (with payments awarded to the state, even if they should eventually end up in the pockets of the injured person, as the ICJ suggested in its 2012 Diallo decision, para 57). Investors would be subject to the good will of their home states. It is not clear how this result should be beneficial to an international rules-based order.\nTowards an Honest ISDS Reform Debate\nImmunities in the broader sense have been considered by the Secretariat of UNCITRAL Working Group III with regard to the status of a possible standing mechanism and its members (here, para 55, here, para 65, and here, para 83) or of an advisory centre on international investment law (here, para 65). The Report of the Working Group of its 38th session resumed in January 2020 flags the issue of immunity from enforcement, holding that ‘attention should be given to the assets of a State that would be subject to enforcement as well as issues relating to State immunity’ and that ‘reference was made to the 2004 United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property (which applied to the immunity of a State and its property from the jurisdiction of the courts of another State) and article 55 of the ICSID Convention’ (see here, para 66). At the beginning of the session, the Chair pointed to the view that enforceability was ‘one of the most significant benefits’ of the current ISDS system (see the audio recording of the meeting on 20 January 2020 at 23.51) and a number of delegations addressed the issue of immunities in this regard (see the audio recording of the meeting on 22 January 2020). Morocco proceeded to reiterate in a written submission that enforcement should follow the 2004 United Nations Convention.\nApart from these considerations, the issue of immunity in its entire scope has not been prioritised in the discussion, nor have any of the additional hurdles. An honest ISDS reform debate must also consider the issue of immunities, an issue that equally persists within the Union. By excluding a separate legal remedy for intra-EU investments, the investor will most probably end up before the courts of the host or home state. A layer of international dispute settlement would be shed to reveal more sovereignty. While immunities are an unlikely danger for the autonomy of the EU legal order, as was the concern of the Court of Justice of the European Union in its Achmea decision, they will not promote an “ever closer Union”. If intra-EU BITs are unnecessary in a single market, why are immunities?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"concise and natural"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"multi-aspect"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:807be512-447c-406e-a8f2-56afddd095a2>","<urn:uuid:f8f9d103-c797-4740-8bbc-aab6dc940e36>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can organizations improve their outreach efforts, and what environmental concerns should they address in their communications?","answer":"Organizations can improve their outreach by using various sources for content, including periodicals, news magazines, libraries, and photographs, while ensuring their communications are well-written and eye-appealing. They should also involve multiple contributors, such as officers and committee members, to provide diverse perspectives. Additionally, organizations should address environmental concerns in their communications, including raising awareness about climate change impacts like rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and threats to wildlife. They can encourage members to take action through energy conservation, proper waste disposal, and participation in environmental protection initiatives like clean-up projects and petitions.","context":["Communication is necessary to a successful life or to a successful lodge. In order to be effective, an employer must communicate clearly to is employees, a father to his children, and a Master to his officers and members. Trestleboards are the essential communication tool of the Master. It takes the lodge to 100% of the membership, whether they are active members who participate in the lodge activities or are housebound non- driving members who cannot attend any of the lodge functions. For many members it is the ONLY contact that they have with their lodge and gives them a feeling of knowing the active members of the lodge by reading their names in the trestleboard.\nThe trestleboard projects the lodges s image to its members and,\nperhaps more importantly, to non-members. You never know who will pick up a copy of your latest trestleboard, and after reading it come away with an impression of Masonry and your lodge. The impression can be favorable or unfavorable depending on how well the trestleboard is written and its overall appearance.\nHow does your trestleboard look? How can it be improved? Take a critical look at your present trestleboard. Is it too big or too small? Having a large trestleboard means that you can put more in it. But sometimes the content of the articles suffer when you have to fill those large spaces. On the other hand, a larger size gives you the opportunity to increase the print size – this make it easier for your older members to read. Should you use photographs in the trestleboard? It costs more money, but as the old saying goes A picture is worth a thousand words. Whatever you decide to do, make your trestleboard eye appealing and dont forget that it projects your lodges image. Keep it well written.\nThere are many sources available to you – almost everywhere you look!\nPrevious trestleboards from your own lodge and from other lodges; your own periodicals or your Maine Mason, news magazines, the Readers Digest, local newspapers, and others all provide inspiration. Publications from concordant bodies such as Scottish Rites Northern\nLight, the York Rites Knight Templar, etc., are also excellent sources of ideas.\nBooks on Masonry from your personal library, the local library or the Grand Lodge library are other possible sources. In addition, the Research Lodges have more material, from their monthly articles to books that you can purchase or borrow, than you can ever use. A less obvious source is to use notes taken while you are attending Masonic or non-Masonic functions. Look around you. Youre sure to find many more sources.\nIf you quote an article or a part of an article you must obtain the permission of the author and in many cases the publisher as well. You will probably find that it is easier to obtain the permission of Masonic authors, but you must still get their permission. So now what? Well you dont have to use the article directly.\nInstead use the idea of the article. You dont have to have permission to use the idea when you use your own words. So, rewrite the article using the idea behind its words.\nSometimes the article lends itself directly to your words. For example, one Master read an article that had left all of the os out. This made the article very difficult to read. So he wrote a trestleboard article using this technique. In this article he told the members of his lodge how hard it was to lead the lodge without their support and presence.\nThis idea could be used in any number of ways. You only have to use your imagination.\nRemember if you use direct quotes – YOU HAVE TO HAVE PERMISSION; if you use your own words, you dont.\nWhen should you start collecting articles/ideas for your trestleboard?\nAS SOON AS YOU CAN. Start when you are the Junior Warden or even earlier if possible. Why?\nSome articles you would like to use are jime related. They appear about a year ahead of the time that you need them. For example, articles on George Washingtons Birthday usually only appear once a year in February. If you wait until you need this article you cant get it into your February trestleboard as it needs to be written and submitted to your trestleboard editor in January. Collect early and be sure to gather two to three times the quantity that youll actually use. Some ideas dont look as good on review at a later date.\nThe best way to organize your items for trestleboard articles is to cut and paste the. newspaper or magazine articles onto 3×5 cards. For books or magazines that you cant or dont want to deface, copy the pages first and then cut and paste.\nIf you carry a few 3 x 5 cards with you when you attend Masonic functions you can make your notes directly on these and you will be prepared to use your notes directly when you return home.\nNext file your 3×5 cards by topic or by theme. For example, George Washingtons Birthday, the 4th of July, Valentines Day, Masonic Affiliated Youth Orders, Masonic education articles, etc. Then shortly after the Annual Communication of Grand Lodge, when you have completed your annual plan as Senior Warden, you can start putting your ideas for next years trestleboard articles together.\nSort the articles and ideas that you have collected into monthly files. Use the monthly themes that you have established for your annual plan. For example, if in February you have planned a Sweethearts Night program, articles or ideas about Valentines Day could be placed in this month. In May, you might have decided to have a Founders Day,\nprograms and articles about the history of the lodge or local area would be appropriate here. In June, you might have planned a trip to the Seadogs. This is a good time to use articles on Masonic Education such as – Where the expression Meet me on the level\ncome from? or Why does the Master wear a top hat?, as you probably wont be writing about baseball. Having a well thought out plan will make the sorting of your articles easier.\nWhen you have finished sorting the articles and ideas that you have collected, you will find that you have many left over. Pass these files on to your junior officers. These files will help them get started get started on their own collection, and in a very short time the Lodge will have an impressive resource file.\nMasters have given the writing of the Masters message different priorities. Some look forward to the opportunity of contacting the membership of the Lodge and presenting them with ideas that they have. Others feel that this is the worst thing that has ever happened to them, so they use their Lodge Secretary or even their printer to write their articles. There is nothing wrong with using an Editor or Trestleboard Committee to edit and setup the trestleboard, BUT THE MASTER MUST WRITE THE MASTERS MESSAGE. It cannot be delegated. The Master has an obligation to communicate with his Lodge.\nSo, if it is so tough, what can you do to make it easier? The above paragraph – GETTING ORGANIZED – has already given you some ideas that you can use to make the job easier. The following are some additional ideas you might use:\n1. For the first trestleboard use your annual plan. Lay out your plans for the coming year. Let everyone see what you have planned and the date it is planned for. Then use your annual plan to provide you with other ideas for the month as suggested above.\n2. You might write about important upcoming Lodge events such as a Ladiess Night program or Mason of the Year Awards. Or perhaps your Past Masters Night line-up.\nBut, leave the monthly description of your other Lodge events to others.\n3. Recognize members who have given community service, i.e., a man who has been Scoutmaster for many years, the president of the local Rotary, or adult leaders of Rainbow and DeMolay.\n4. Recognize the youth leaders of DeMolay and Rainbow. Give a short biography of the leaders and a history of the youth group itself.\n5. Enlighten the members with some Masonic education. Write an article on What does this mean? or Where does that come from?\nFor example, where does the blue in Blue Lodge\ncome from? The possibilities are endless.\n6. Use topical articles tied to the time period. For example, Washingtons Birthday,\nthe 4th of July, Mothers Day, Valentines Day, and Election Day. (You cant talk about whos running, but you can encourage the membership to get out and vote. Remind them its a privilege and an obligation.) But whatever you write, be optimistic, enthusiastic and informative. There is no faster way to drive your membership away than to blast them, month after month, with a guilt trip for not attending Lodge. As the old saying goes Honey attracts more bees than vinegar ever will.\nUnless you, as Master, want to write the entire trestleboard yourself,\nyou had better enlist some help. The two naturals are the Junior and Senior Wardens. Its good experience for them and will give them some preparation for their year as Master.\nMake sure their assignments are clear: it would be unfortunate if each wrote on the same topic.\nThe Senior Warden might write on the degrees that are to be exemplified in the coming month or give a thumbnail sketch of your newest Master Mason. The Junior Warden might review last months program giving a brief overview of the program and mention how good it was to welcome back any brethren (by name) who might be infrequent attendees to the Lodge. He might preview nex$~months program, its entertainment, or the supper.\nIf either of the Wardens is chairman of a committee, this is a good opportunity to report to all the Brethren what that committee is doing.\nThe Secretary could also write some articles regarding membership, dues, and information address change reminders. He might also write a Secretarys Corner giving about members who have moved away or are travelling and what their families are doing.\nMiscellaneous articles could also be written such as a Sunshine Report\n(sickness and distress), memorials (obituaries), monthly calendar of events, a thumbnail sketch of your officers (one at a time, please), and a list of your appointments\n(semi-annually). The list goes on and on.\nIt is critical that the trestleboard reach the membership in a timely fashion. If it arrives after the events have occurred, you have frustrated your membership and wasted valuable time, effort and money.\nOne way to ensure the timely arrival of your trestleboard is to establish a time line schedule. The development of a time line is described as follows:\n1. Itemize the tasks involved in producing and distributing the trestleboard.\nThese tasks might include writing the articles, organizing the contents,\nprinting, stuffing and sorting for mail, mail time, time required for the trestleboard to be in the members hands before the Stated Meeting\n2. Next, determine the number of days that each task requires, Then, starting with the coming months Stated Meeting, and work backwards through the month. For example, if your Stated Meeting is on March 6th, the time line would end with March 6th and you would count backwards through February.\n3. Mark off the days that each task would take, starting with the last task and work through to the first task. In the example shown, it would be necessary for you to start writing your trestleboard articles on February 3rd. All of the articles would have to be completed, ready for organizing.\nBy February 10th. You, of course, will have to establish your own time line requirements.","You must have noticed the signs. Longer, hotter summers. Shorter, milder winters. Birds arriving on their breeding grounds weeks before they once did.\nSo, why not just enjoy the weather? Because what seems like a change for the better is really a cause for grave concern. Today, the Earth is heating up faster than at any other time in 10,000 years. The reason is the greenhouse effect. Just as a greenhouse captures the sun’s warmth, greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. When we burn coal, oil, and natural gas to fuel factories, communities, and automobiles, we add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution in the early 1700s, greenhouse gas concentrations have risen sharply: carbon dioxide (CO2) by 30 per cent, nitrous oxide by 15 per cent, and methane by 100 per cent. These increases heighten the greenhouse effect, raising global temperatures and causing the planet’s climate to change.\nThat is why extreme weather events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and radical swings between deluge and drought, are becoming more common. Polar ice caps are shrinking. Mountain glaciers are melting. Sea levels are rising. Lake levels are falling. Meanwhile, biological impacts of climate change are becoming more evident. Many species are relocating, migrating sooner, and bearing young earlier than in the past. Fish from southern waters, like great white sharks and Pacific blue marlin, are appearing more frequently off Canada’s coasts. Coral reefs worldwide are dying off. Amphibians are declining globally. Entire ecosystems are shifting and wildlife habitats vanishing. The most dramatic changes of all are taking place in Canada’s Arctic, which is heating up faster than anywhere else. Here, northerners are watching in disbelief as the permafrost melts beneath their feet, Pacific salmon are caught for the first time, and sea ice shrinks away from the coast.\nWhile the science of climate change is still evolving, most experts predict a dramatic shift in environmental conditions worldwide. Scientists anticipate that CO2 concentrations will triple by the end of this century. By 2100, average global temperatures could rise by 1.5 to 4.5°C. In some parts of Canada, temperatures may increase by 5 to 10°C. This rapid warming of our oceans and atmosphere could result in climatic changes greater than humans have ever seen.\nTo determine which regions are at risk and how, experts use computer-generated global circulation models. These models show that aquatic ecosystems are especially vulnerable because of their limited ability to adapt to climatic changes and that, as a northern nation with a longer coastline and more freshwater than any other country, Canada may be among the hardest hit. What else do they forecast?\n- As temperatures rise, ocean waters may expand and polar ice caps, glaciers, and sea ice could melt faster than before, raising sea levels by up to one metre, causing higher tides, submerging islands, eroding shorelines, flooding coastal wetlands, and polluting ground and surface waters.\n- Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes, may happen more often, with more severe impacts on coastal and inland areas.\n- Rain and snow could increase in some regions like the Great Lakes but decrease in others like the Prairies.\n- Increasing cycles of drought and flood may stress freshwater resources, lower river and lake levels, and make it harder to cultivate crops.\n- Higher water temperatures could change the course and intensity of major ocean currents, disrupting entire ecosystems, and altering the dispersion of nutrients and warmth that sustain marine life.\nWildlife in Hot Water\nClimate change could mean troubled times ahead for an untold diversity of aquatic life, from the equator to the ends of the Earth:\n- The fate of countless plants and animals may depend on their ability to move from unfavourable climatic conditions to ones that meet their survival needs. Those that are endangered, slow moving, or isolated in fragmented areas could find themselves stranded.\n- Migrators whose arrival and departure dates are no longer in sync with the rhythms of nature could miss the food sources they need to survive, the warm weather they need to breed, and the wind and ocean currents they need to travel.\n- Changing distributions, migration patterns, and growth rates of salmon, cod, and herring may disrupt commercial fisheries.\n- Heavier rainfall in coastal regions could result in more polluted run-off entering estuaries and bays, which provide food and shelter for fish and shellfish and are important stopovers for migratory birds.\n“The time has come,” the walrus said, “to talk of many things…”\nOne of the things the walrus talks about in Lewis Carroll’s poem is “why the sea is boiling hot.” Nowadays, warmer seas may well be a topic of conversation among walruses lounging on ice floes in Canada’s Arctic. The many grunts, growls, barks, and bellows emitted by these massive marine mammals could be their way of lamenting the loss of the habitat that gives them life.\nAmong the fastest-warming regions on Earth, the Arctic may face the worst impacts of climate change in the 21st century. Scientists predict the continued melting of sea ice: a vast, frozen platform that has already thinned by 40 per cent in recent years yet is indispensable to the survival of walruses, polar bears, king eiders, narwhals, and countless other creatures.\nRanging from Canada’s Eastern Arctic, down to James Bay and the Labrador coast, across the North Atlantic to the Kara Sea, the walrus is no longer found in the Northwest Atlantic, Mackenzie Delta, or St. Lawrence River. Its disappearance from these regions was the result not of climate change but of commercial hunting in the past. Remaining walrus populations have largely recovered in the Eastern Arctic and are now hunted only by indigenous people, who use every part of the animal’s body for food, carvings, hides for covering kayaks, and other practical purposes.\nThe walrus itself makes the most of nature’s gifts to eke out an existence. This one-tonne, two-tusked heap of wrinkles, blubber, and whiskers is perfectly adapted to survive in the Arctic seas, whether using its thick skin and folds of fat to withstand the frigid temperatures, diving to depths of up to 100 metres with the help of its powerful fins, or using its tusks to fend off polar bears or to dig for clams on the ocean floor. The question is whether the walrus can adapt to the challenges of climate change.\nWhat Is Being Done?\nClimate change is a global problem. All the world’s nations must work together to find solutions, especially heavily industrialized countries whose populations and greenhouse gas emissions are increasing rapidly. To meet this challenge, Canada supports international efforts aimed at minimizing quantities of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.\nAcross this country, governments, industries, schools, communities, and individuals are taking action to curb climate change and address its impacts. Their efforts include improving the management of aquatic and terrestrial habitats; supporting climate change and atmospheric research; increasing energy efficiency in buildings and automobiles; and developing renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines and solar power, as well as fuel cell technology.\nCan You Help Turn Down the Heat?\nGet informed about climate change and its impacts on aquatic wildlife and habitat. Then, undertake ocean action projects, conserving food, water, shelter, and space for species threatened by climate change. Choose projects that protect the natural ability of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to absorb greenhouse gases and maintain a healthy climate; that help isolated species meet their needs by improving connectivity between fragmented habitats; and that buffer the impacts of climate change on marine habitats.\nDo everything you can to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging energy efficiency and promoting non-polluting energy sources at home, at school, and in your community. Contact public officials and urge them to develop and strengthen programs to encourage energy efficiency and renewable energy; raise fuel economy standards for cars and trucks; set strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants; improve efficiency standards for electronics and home appliances; and ensure the sound management of marine ecosystems.\nCelebrate Oceans Day!\nYou and your community can commemorate Oceans Day in many ways:\n- Create an Oceans Day display addressing climate change or another theme at your local library, school, or community centre.\n- Encourage family, friends, and neighbours to dispose of household hazardous wastes, such as batteries, motor oil, leftover paint, and solvent containers, at proper waste disposal sites rather than dumping them down the drain.\n- Link up with another community — coastal or inland — in a distant part of Canada or the world and collaborate on ocean awareness activities or action projects.\n- Recruit volunteers to clean up a beach, river, wetland, or coastal area through local media, posters displayed in community centres and schools, and by contacting youth groups.\n- Write letters to the editor of your local newspaper expressing your concerns about ocean health.\n- Circulate a petition voicing your concerns about climate change or another environmental problem and suggesting solutions; send the petition to the prime minister, a Member of Parliament, or other environmental decision-maker.\n- Prepare a news release or public service announcement describing your Oceans Day activities; submit it to a local newspaper or radio station.\n- Persuade your town council to officially declare Oceans Day, June 8, and implement ocean-action projects.\n© Canadian Wildlife Federation\nAll rights reserved.

There’s no shortage of them these days — the pandemic has spurred countless challenges and intense despair; there are too many to list. Teaching during the pandemic has been a challenge in and of itself, as we are always looking for ways for students to be engaged with curricula and drive their learning, and that’s hard to do whether we’re teaching in person or remotely.\nIf you think back to your college or grad school days, you may recall the constructivist thinkers, such as Jean Piaget, who believed that students learn best when they construct their own learning. Problem- and project-based learning offers teachers an opportunity to do just that — instead of telling students the answers, you can create a learning environment in which students learn through discovery, thinking, tinkering, reflecting, and developing answers on their own.\nWe may already be familiar with ways that we can bring this type of learning to in-person classrooms, but it can also be delivered to students who are learning in remote or blended environments.\nProblem-based learning vs. project-based learning\nProject-based learning is situated in real-life learning. The Buck Institute for Education defines project-based learning as a “teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging, and complex question, problem or challenge.” If you ever walk into a classroom and see students working on a project with an exciting buzz in the room, chances are, their teachers have designed a project-based learning task.\nIn our own lives, we know that when working on a project, we often discover a problem we didn’t realize we had — but once it surfaces, it demands a solution. (Remember those early pandemic days when we were acclimating to teaching remotely, but also trying to solve the problem of having no dedicated teaching space at home?) In teaching, this idea rings true, too. As we are learning more about a topic, we may discover a problem alongside our students, and this is the breeding ground for an exciting new project. This is the foundation of problem-based learning.\nProblem-based learning also offers students real-life learning opportunities, as well as the chance “to think creatively and bring their knowledge to bear in unique ways” (2020 Schunk, p. 64). Problem-based learning can look differently depending on the content and grade level, but often includes group discussions that allow for multiple perspectives on a topic, a simulated situation that involves role playing, or group work that includes both collaborative work and time to complete tasks individually.\nProblem-based learning promotes autonomous learning, self-assessment skills, planning time, project work, and oral and written expression skills. According to a July 2020 article from the Hechinger Report, problem-based learning has gained tremendous momentum, because it allows students to work more freely and at their own pace — a key advantage when learning remotely. In problem-based learning, the content and skills are organized around problems, rather than as a hierarchical list of topics. It’s also inherently learner-centered because the learner actively creates their own knowledge as they attempt to solve the problem.\nPutting the “Problem” into Practice\nAs former English teachers, we both understand the challenge of putting new professional learning into practice. For teachers who need a refresher on how to design a problem-based learning experience for their students, Problem Based Learning: Six Steps to Design, Implement and Assess breaks down the steps to move PBL into practice as follows:\nTo help put these problem-based steps into perspective, we can look to our recent work with partners from a high school in the South Bronx. The chemistry team there decided to use an anti-racist lens while addressing a problem that was very real to their students — fireworks. During the summer of 2020, there was a record number of firework incidents in New York City. According to an article in the New York Times, the city received over 1,700 fireworks complaints in the first half of June alone. Our partners used this problem as an opportunity for students to research fireworks from multiple lenses, and imagine how they might present their findings and recommendations to local officials. After all, shouldn’t New York Governor Andrew Cuomo hear from high school students in the Bronx about the effects fireworks have on their communities?\nHere’s what the framework might look like in this example:\nFrom here, we can imagine the possibilities for this framework, considering how students might address the underlying problem from different perspectives and content areas:\nTeaching and learning throughout a global pandemic has presented more than its share of challenges. Out of necessity, tremendous innovation has taken place with the use of technology, pedagogy, and curriculum. With problem-based learning, we can continue this innovation in our classrooms, offering our students opportunities to solve real world problems, demonstrate critical thinking, and collaborate with their peers. We would love to hear what problem-based learning tasks you are designing for your classrooms!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"long search query"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"multi-aspect"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"novice"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6a8b47ff-647b-4c1a-a52c-21c3097c6ca1>","<urn:uuid:2285de50-3939-41b9-a10b-f1d64c1e528a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the early symptoms of cerebral palsy in terms of limping, and what specific physical therapy interventions are recommended for treating mobility issues?","answer":"Cerebral palsy-related limping may not be noticed until the child is older and uses an adult-like gait. It is a neuromuscular disease that some children are born with, often due to difficult births or complications before birth, and while it doesn't get worse with time, mild cases might only become apparent when the child develops a more mature walking pattern. For treatment, physical therapy is recommended for all children with cerebral palsy, regardless of severity. The therapy focuses on improving balance, posture, crawling, climbing, walking, and muscle strength. Physical therapists create individualized treatment plans that address specific issues like muscle atrophy, limited range of motion, muscle spasticity, and joint inflammation. The therapy includes stretches, strength exercises, and games with specific movements, which can be performed in various settings including medical offices, rehabilitation centers, or at home under proper guidance.","context":["Unexplained limping in a child should be evaluated quickly. Some simple causes may include a small rock in the child’s shoe, a splinter in a toe, or a twisted ankle. If no source of limping is obvious after a quick look at the child’s shoes, feet, ankles and legs, the child should see a doctor. Limping may indicate a problem that will result in permanent disability if not treated. Limping with pain may indicate an injury or an infection. Limping with fever may represent an infection in the bone or joints. New, unexplained limping without pain may also be a urgent problem, such as Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease (lack of blood supply to the hip joint) or a slipped capital femoral head (a dislodgement of the top of the leg bone in the hip). Both of these problems can lead to permanent disability if not treated quickly.\nWhat is a limp?\nLimping is a disruption of the normal gait (or the way your child walks). Children first learn to cruise (walk holding onto something) at about 10 months of age and learn to walk freely around 12 months of age. As children are learning to walk they normally stumble, fall, and make jerky steps. This improves over several months and most children will have a normal (adult-like) gait by 3 years of age. Limping occurs when stepping with one foot is faster, slower or more jerky than a step with the other foot. This can occur when putting weight on the foot causes pain.\nWhat if my child always had a limp?\nThis may be due to problems your child was born with such as…\nLeg length discrepancy – Some children are born with one leg that is longer than the other. This may not be noticed until around 3 years of age when your child has an adult-like gait. Sometimes shoe inserts or special shoes can correct the difference. Surgery is reserved for severe cases.\nCerebral palsy – This is a neuromuscular disease that some children are born with. Often the cause of cerebral palsy is not known, but children who suffer from difficult births or complications before birth may be affected. Cerebral palsy does not get worse with time but in mild cases, the problem may not be noticed until the child is older and uses an adult-like gait.\nWhat if my child now has a new limp?\nThis type of limp should always be evaluated by a doctor unless there is an obvious cause (i.e., rock in the shoe, cut on the foot). The possible causes of limping can be separated into groups based on the child’s age.\nInfants (0-1 year of age)\nIf you can’t walk… you can’t limp!\nToddlers (1- 3 years of age)\nDysplasia of the hip – abnormal development of the hip joint. Develops before birth.\nInfection in bone (spine, hip, knee, ankle, or foot) – this is called osteomyelitis and needs to be treated quickly to avoid permanent damage. Especially if fever or pain is present.\nInfection in joints (hip, knee, ankle) – this also needs to be treated quickly to avoid permanent damage to the joint. Especially if fever or pain is present.\nInfection in soft tissues – there may be an obvious infection on the skin or an infection hidden inside. Especially if fever or pain is present.\nInjury – some injuries are unwitnessed and may not have outside evidence (i.e., bruises or scrapes).\nTumors – fortunately, these are rare.\nSchool-age kids (4 – 18 years of age)\nInfection – same as for toddlers\nInjury – same as for toddlers\nTransient synovitis – some viral infections can cause temporary, harmless inflammation in joints. You should ask your doctor to make sure it is not a more severe bacterial infection.\nLegg-Calvé-Perthes disease (typically in kids ages 4 – 9 years, more common in boys) – this is caused by a lack of blood supply to the top of the femur (upper leg bone) at the hip joint. Damage can occur quickly or slowly over time. Damage may be permanent, resulting in permanent limping or disability. An x-ray of the hip can help with this diagnosis.\nSlipped capital femoral head (typically affects children between 12 and 15 years of age, especially obese kids) – The top of the femur (upper leg bone) breaks and slips out of place at the hip joint. Treatment may involve a hip brace, a cast or surgery.\nTumors – fortunately, these are rare.\nWhen should my child see a doctor?\nAny new limp that can’t be explained by a simple problem (i.e., rock in the shoe, cut on the foot, known minor injury) should be evaluated by a doctor. This is especially true for children with a limp and other symptoms such as severe pain, fever, or limited motion of a joint.","Physical therapy is one of the most important forms of therapy for people living with cerebral palsy. In fact, most physicians recommend physical therapy for all children with cerebral palsy, regardless of how minor or severe the disorder is.\nGoals of Physical Therapy for Children With Cerebral Palsy\nChildren diagnosed with cerebral palsy will have various degrees of muscle control, balance, and mobility, depending upon how severe the disorder is. Physical therapy helps with these issues by assisting children with balance, posture, crawling, climbing, walking, and muscle strength exercises.\nIn addition, physical therapy helps children with cerebral palsy to:\n- Overcome physical limitation obstacles\n- Increase independence\n- Help expand range of motions\n- Build muscle tone\n- Decrease the chances of bone deformity\n- Learn about adaptive equipment and how to use them\n- Increase fitness, flexibility, balance, and posture\n- Reduce physical discomfort and pain\nPhysical Therapy Benefits\nThere are a number of benefits of participating in physical therapy, especially for children with cerebral palsy. The primary benefits include helping children overcome physical limitations that significantly interfere with their daily lives.\nA licensed physical therapist will construct an in-depth treatment plan, according to each child’s strengths and weaknesses. Once the treatment plan is developed, children can benefit from their individualized physical plan which can help with side effects of cerebral palsy that may include:\n- Muscle atrophy\n- Limited range of motion\n- Loss of joint function\n- Muscle spasticity\n- Pain in muscles and joints\n- Joint inflammation\n- Rigid muscles\nA Typical Physical Therapy Session for Children With Cerebral Palsy\nPrior to any child starting physical therapy, an in-depth medical history and physical examination is carried out. In addition to the physical examination, a licensed physical therapist will conduct numerous other tests in order to assess muscle control, functions, and mechanics, such as:\n- Range of motion\n- Physical strength\n- Flexibility and balance\n- Joint integrity\n- Sensory integration\n- Cognitive functioning\nAfterward, a care plan is created based upon the child’s test results. A physical therapist will then set goals for a child’s progress, and work with the child to meet those benchmarks. This typically means the therapist and his or her assistants manipulate a child’s body while completing stretches, strength exercises or games with specific movements or purpose.\nOften therapy includes instructions for exercises, stretches, posturing and balance to be performed while outside the therapy sessions; at home, school or work.\nWhere Does Physical Therapy Take Place?\nPhysical therapy takes place in several settings, including outpatient medical offices or clinics, inpatient rehabilitation centers, specialized physical therapy centers, skilled nursing centers, hospitals, special education classrooms, and in the home.\nThe number of physical therapy settings is dependent on several factors; the most important of these is prescribed treatment of the child. Additional considerations include what adaptive equipment is used in treatment, as well as the abilities of a caregiver to provide additional therapy at home. Insurance coverage can also dictate how often a child attends therapy in a clinical setting.\nIn many cases, a physical therapist will prescribe exercises to be completed at home. The physical therapist or an assistant will train the individual with cerebral palsy, the parent or caregiver and the primary caregivers on how to properly perform exercises at home.\nPhysical Therapy Providers\nPhysical therapy is performed by licensed, accredited physical therapists, or physiotherapists. These professionals are often assisted by physical therapy assistants.Practicing physical therapists may be doctors, some having earned a master’s degree in physical therapy or kinesiology.\nThe coursework a potential physical therapist must complete is extensive and includes:\n- Human growth and development\n- Therapeutic practices\nPhysical therapy assistants, who work under the supervision of a physical therapist, typically complete bachelor’s or associate degree programs focusing on the same topics as the physical therapist.\nAll states require licensure via state board examination to practice, though the requirements to take the exam vary from state to state. Most states require the therapist to successfully complete the National Physical Therapy Examination.\nMost states require licensure for physical therapy assistants. Assistants work under the careful guidance of physical therapists. Assistants may also pursue additional certification in specific therapies, such as aquatics, through the American Physical Therapy Association.\nAre There Any Risks to Physical Therapy?\nAlthough physical therapists and their assistants are trained to minimize unforeseen circumstances while carrying out treatment plans with patients, there is some risk associated with therapy. Physical therapy is meant to be restorative in nature, a therapist more often than not will not over-work a patient.\nIf physical therapy is taken too far in a given session, this can cause injury or unnecessary pain, which is not the goal of therapy. The key to minimizing risks and maximizing results is open communication between the child, his or her caregivers and physical therapists. Identify where your child’s physical and psychological limits are.\nTalk to your child regularly to discover difficult areas of therapy. Don’t be afraid to mention your concerns with the therapist."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"verbose and natural"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"multi-aspect"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c4cfb142-8b5e-44ae-9e6d-7322ac619d48>","<urn:uuid:de13ee0f-d400-46aa-b49b-eaa34eaecb3a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which came first historically: the Fifth Amendment's protection of citizenship rights or the Fourteenth Amendment's?","answer":"The Fifth Amendment came first, being ratified in 1791 as part of the Bill of Rights, while the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified much later in 1868. The Fourteenth Amendment notably expanded citizenship rights by granting citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States, including former slaves, and guaranteeing equal protection of the laws.","context":["Passed by Congress September 25, 1789. Ratified December 15, 1791. The first 10 amendments form the Bill of Rights.\nNo person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\nGrand Jury Protection: The Fifth Amendment requirement that serious federal criminal charges be started by a grand jury (a group of citizens who hear evidence from a prosecutor about potential crimes) is rooted in English common law. Its basic purpose is to provide a fair method for beginning criminal proceedings against those accused of committing crimes. Grand jury charges can be issued against anyone except members of the military, who are instead subject to courts-martial in the military justice system.\nTo avoid giving government unchecked powers, grand jurors are selected from the general population and their work, conducted in secret, is not hampered by rigid rules about the type of evidence that can be heard. In fact, grand jurors can act on their own knowledge and are free to start criminal proceedings on any information that they think relevant.\nIt is these broad powers that have led some critics to charge that grand juries are little more than puppets of prosecutors. Grand juries also serve an investigative role-because grand juries can compel witnesses to testify in the absence of their lawyers.\nA significant number of states do not use grand juries, instead they begin criminal proceedings using informations or indictments. The right to a grand jury is one of only a few protections in the Bill of Rights that has not been applied to the states by the Fourteenth Amendment.\nProtection against Double Jeopardy: This portion of the Fifth Amendment protects individuals from being “twice put in jeopardy of life or limb”—that is, in danger of being punished more than once for the same criminal act. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the double jeopardy clause to protect against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal or conviction and against multiple punishments for the same crime. Like other provisions in the Bill of Rights that affect criminal prosecutions, the double jeopardy clause is rooted in the idea that the government should not have unlimited power to prosecute and punish criminal suspects. Rather, the government gets only one chance to make its case.\nRight against Self-Incrimination: This provision of the Fifth Amendment is probably the best-known of all constitutional rights, as it appears frequently on television and in movies—whether in dramatic courtroom scenes (“I take the Fifth!”) or before the police question someone in their custody (“You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do say can be used against you in a court of law.”). The right protects a person from being forced to reveal to the police, prosecutor, judge, or jury any information that might subject him or her to criminal prosecution. Even if a person is guilty of a crime, the Fifth Amendment demands that the prosecutors come up with other evidence to prove their case. If police violate the Fifth Amendment by forcing a suspect to confess, a court may suppress the confession, that is, prohibit it from being used as evidence at trial.\nThe right to remain silent also means that a defendant has the right not to take the witness stand at all during his or her trial, and that the prosecutor cannot point to the defendant’s silence as evidence of guilt. There are, however, limitations on the right against self-incrimination. For example, it applies only to testimonial acts, such as speaking, nodding, or writing. Other personal information that might be incriminating, like blood or hair samples, DNA or fingerprints, may be used as evidence. Similarly, incriminating statements that an individual makes voluntarily—such as when a suspect confesses to a friend or writes in a personal diary—are not protected.\nRight to Due Process: The right to due process of law has been recognized since 1215, when the Magna Carta (the British charter) was adopted. Historically, the right protected people accused of crimes from being imprisoned without fair procedures (like indictments and trials, where they would have an opportunity to confront their accusers). The right of due process has grown in two directions: It affords individuals a right to a fair process (known as procedural due process) and a right to enjoy certain fundamental liberties without governmental interference (known as substantive due process). The Fifth Amendment’s due process clause applies to the federal government’s conduct. In 1868 the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment expanded the right of due process to include limits on the actions of state governments.\nToday, court decisions interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process right generally apply to the Fifth Amendment and vice versa.\nTakings Clause: The takings clause of the Fifth Amendment strikes a balance between the rights of private property owners and the right of the government to take that property for a purpose that benefits the public at large. When the government takes private property, it is required to pay just compensation to the property owner for his or her loss. The takings power of the government, sometimes referred to as the power of eminent domain, may be used for a wide range of valid public uses (for a highway or a park, for example). For the most part, when defining just compensation, courts try to reach some approximation of market value.\nAnnenberg Classroom connects an award-winning, comprehensive multimedia curriculum on the Constitution to daily civics news and articles that support in-class and online student discussion. Annenberg Classroom also includes FlackCheck.org, an excellent resource for teaching political literacy skills. Annenberg Classroom is presented by the Leonore Annenberg Institute for Civics of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania.\nThe Fifth Amendment guarantees five rights of a very diverse nature. The most popularly known right in the Fifth Amendment, the right against self-incrimination in criminal cases, is commonly referred to as “taking the Fifth.” Other rights in the Fifth Amendment include the right to have serious criminal charges screened by a grand jury; to avoid being tried twice for the same offense; to have due process of law; and to receive just compensation when private property is taken for public use. The longest amendment in the Bill of Rights, the Fifth Amendment is a hodgepodge of provisions affecting both criminal law and civil law. But all of them limit the power of the government to take action against the individual.\nLinda R. Monk, J.D., is a constitutional scholar, journalist, and nationally award-winning author.

When these cells break down, they can leave the body predisposed to bone marrow infections and can weaken the immune system, eventually causing diseases such as cancer to develop. The average, healthy, white-blood count should be between 4,500 and 10,000 white blood cells. Incorporating healthy choices could improve your white blood count.\n1. Eat foods that will increase white blood cells. These include vegetables such as asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, greens, beets, pumpkins and mushrooms, and fruits such as oranges and melons.\n2. Incorporate fish oil into your diet; DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) contained in fish oil supplements prevent white blood cells from sticking to the blood vessel's inner walls, decreasing the chances of inflammation diseases in the bones and in the muscles. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil help repair white blood cells and strengthen the immune system. Eating foods high in fish oil, and low in saturated fats like salmon, tuna, halibut, and dark, leafy greens, can strengthen white blood cells.\n3. Healthy dietary fat intake. The fat intake for individuals that need to replenish white blood cells should be at least 30 percent of the daily calorie intake.\n4. You might need to supplement B12/folic acid, vitamin A, vitamin C and zinc because they support white cell development, preventing cellular breakdown. Quality multivitamins or healthy juices can replenish damaged cells by providing added nutrition if an individual is deficient.\n5. Consume healthy bacteria. Organic yogurt (homemade is best!), sauerkraut, kim chi and other fermented foods can keep the body safe from infections, especially those that attack the immune system and white cell production. These foods contain probiotics, or friendly bacteria that stimulate immunity cells in the gastrointestinal tract. These probiotics, may help stimulate white cell production.\n6. Drink green tea to replenish white cells. Green tea is abundant in antioxidants, which is a key ingredient in maintaining healthy white blood cells. Green tea can protect against experimentally induced DNA damage which can reduce the progression of harmful cell colonies. Decaffeinated green tea provides the cells immune protection, particularly when cancer patients undergoing radiation or chemotherapy.\nHow to Replenish Red Blood Cells\nRed blood cells perform the most important blood duty. A single drop of blood contains millions of red blood cells which are constantly traveling through your body delivering oxygen and removing waste. If they weren't, your body would slowly die.\nRed blood cells are red only because they contain protein chemical called hemoglobin which is bright red in color. Hemoglobin contains the element Iron, making it an excellent vehicle for transporting oxygen and carbon dioxide. As blood passes through the lungs, oxygen molecules attach to the hemoglobin. As the blood passes through the body's tissue, the hemoglobin releases the oxygen to the cells. The empty hemoglobin molecules then bond with the tissue's carbon dioxide or other waste gases, transporting it away. Over time, the red blood cells get worn out and eventually die. The average life cycle of a red blood cell is 120 days. Your bones are continually producing new blood cells, replenishing your supply. The blood itself, is re-circulated throughout your body, not being remade all of the time.\n1. Eat citrus fruits high in vitamin C.\n2. Protein is needed to build hemoglobin. Clams, oysters, mussels. Liver, fish, beef, lamb & eggs. Alfalfa sprouts and bean sprouts..\n3. Fresh wheat grass juice is filled with chlorophyll that can improve hemoglobin content. Warning if you are not use to wheat grass juice. Ease into it by drinking one ounce a day. To help make it more palatable, you can chase it with the juice of a slice of lemon. A little goes a long way.\n4. Drink coconut water. It is filled with potassium and is a great source to replenish blood loss. Do not confuse coconut water with cream of coconut or coconut milk. Coconut water has a mild coconut flavor."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"concise and natural"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"comparison"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b883728a-686c-4093-9aba-851beaf48f59>","<urn:uuid:cdebc041-2234-4342-bd1a-2d8223c71caf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"studying neuroscience what evidence shows cortisol epinephrine interaction affects emotional memory formation","answer":"Cortisol works together with epinephrine (adrenaline) to create memories of short-term emotional events. This mechanism may help people remember situations to avoid in the future. However, long-term cortisol exposure can damage hippocampal cells and impair learning ability, while also inhibiting the retrieval of already stored information.","context":["Stress is how the body reacts to a real or imagined stressor — a stimulus that causes stress. Acute stressors affect a bodily organ in the short term; chronic stressors over the longer term. Chronic stress is the state of prolonged tension from internal or external stressors which may cause various physical manifestations such as asthma, back pain, arrhythmias, fatigue, headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, ulcers, and suppression of the immune system. Chronic stress takes a more significant toll on the body than acute stress. It can raise blood pressure, increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, and induce symptoms of anxiety and depression.\nThe Three Stages of Stress – From Acute to Chronic\n- Alarm: In this first stage, when the threat or stressor is first identified or realized, the body’s stress response is in a state of alarm. During this stage, adrenaline is produced in order to bring about the flight-or-fight response, causing sweating, raised heart rate, etc. The body’s resistance to the stressor drops temporarily below the normal range and some level of shock may be experienced. There is also some activation of the HPA Axis, producing cortisol, as discussed in our last post.\n- Resistance: If the stressor persists, the body must find some means of coping with the stress. Although it begins to try to adapt to the strains or demands of the environment, the body cannot keep this up indefinitely, so its resources are gradually depleted. As it attempts to cope with the condition that is causing the stress, the mind may try to focus on the problem, which can actually exaggerate the awareness of the problem and make it seem difficult to overcome.\n- Exhaustion: third stage. At this point, all of the body’s resources are eventually depleted and the body is unable to maintain normal function. The initial symptoms may reappear (sweating, raised heart rate, etc.). Long-term damage may result, as the body’s immune system becomes exhausted, and bodily functions become impaired. The result can manifest itself in obvious illnesses such as ulcers, depression, diabetes, digestive system problems or cardiovascular problems. It can also manifest as a chronic pain syndrome, guarding/avoidance behavior, and/or sleep disturbance. Hopelessness can set in.\nChronic Stress and Cortisol\nWhen the body’s HPA-axis cannot overcome a challenge and/or is chronically exposed to a threat, this system becomes overtaxed and can be harmful to the body and brain. An increased level of cortisol is one of the most dangerous outcomes of chronic stress.\nCortisol is an important hormone in the body, secreted by the adrenal glands and involved in some of the following functions: proper glucose metabolism, regulation of blood pressure, insulin release for blood sugar maintenance, immune function and inflammatory response. Normally, cortisol is present in the body at higher levels in the morning and is at its lowest level at night. Although stress is not the only reason that cortisol is secreted into the bloodstream, it has been termed “the stress hormone” because it’s also secreted in higher levels during the body’s ‘fight or flight’ response to stress, and is responsible for several stress-related changes in the body. Small increases of cortisol have some positive effects: a quick burst of energy for survival reasons, heightened memory functions, a burst of increased immunity, lower sensitivity to pain, and helping to maintain homeostasis in the body.\nPeople are biologically ‘wired’ to react differently to stress.\nWhile cortisol is an important part of the body’s response to stress, it is important that the body’s relaxation response be activated so the body’s functions can return to normal following a stressful event. Unfortunately, in our current high-stress culture, the body’s stress response is activated so often that the body doesn’t always have a chance to return to normal, resulting in a state of chronic stress, thus producing high chronic cortisol levels.\nHigher and more prolonged levels of cortisol in the bloodstream like those in chronic stress have been shown to have negative effects, such as:\n- Impaired cognitive performance (loss or poor concentration, inability to complete tasks or heightened confusion in mildly stressful situations\n- Suppressed thyroid function\n- Blood sugar imbalances such as hyperglycemia\n- Decreased bone density\n- Decrease in muscle tissue\n- Higher blood pressure\n- Lowered immunity and inflammatory responses in the body, slowed wound healing, and other health consequences\n- Increased abdominal fat, which is associated with a greater amount of health problems than fat deposited in other areas of the body.\nWhen people feel stressed, stress hormones can be over-secreted, dramatically affecting the brain. Cortisol also plays a large part in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and memory. In a 2002 article in Biological Psychiatry regarding cortisol, PTSD and memory1, cortisol was noted to work with epinephrine (adrenaline) to create memories of short-term emotional events. This effect may serve as a means to help a person remember what situations to avoid in the future. However, long-term exposure to cortisol damages cells in the hippocampus and can create impaired learning ability. It has been shown that cortisol inhibits memory retrieval of already stored information.\nCortisol secretion varies among individuals. People are biologically ‘wired’ to react differently to stress. One person may secrete higher levels of cortisol than another in the same situation. Studies have shown that people who secrete higher levels of cortisol in response to stress also tend to eat more food, and food that is higher in carbohydrates, than people who secrete less cortisol.\n1“Depression.

{"question":"What role do algorithms play in analyzing social media content, and what are their potential biases in society?","answer":"Algorithms help analyze social media content by studying language patterns and information diffusion across platforms, with research showing they can track temporal and social contagion dynamics across over 150 languages on Twitter. However, these algorithmic systems can lead to concerning biases in society - they can make inferences about people's personal traits, political leanings, and other characteristics from their digital footprint, sometimes without their knowledge. These systems may discriminate against disadvantaged groups depending on how data is collected and interpreted, as seen in cases ranging from employment screening to predictive policing.","context":["Zsófia Rakovics, statistician and sociologist. During her university studies she conducted a research on precarity, globalization and its effect on society and work. She also took part in other sociological investigations (e.g. about gender inequality), and studied the remembrance of the Holocaust, by qualitatively analysing testimonies of survivors. Her methodological interest includes both qualitative and quantitative methods. After completing her master studies, she worked as a data scientist at an international company using computer vision and machine learning technologies to capture emotional reactions. Recently, her interest turned back to memory research, and towards studying populism and the political public discourse with natural language processing methods, through which she is linked to the research group. Her doctoral research focuses on the study of language polarisation, analysing online political public discourse using deep learning language models.\nDoctoral research related to the project titled The layers of political public sphere in Hungary (2001-2020) (supported by NKFIH-K-134428)\nSociological study of language polarization\nDoctoral student: Zsófia Rakovics\nThe doctoral research empirically investigates language change and polarization tendencies in online political discourse (Gentzkow et al. 2016; Prior 2013) using deep learning-based language models (Vaswani et al. 2017; Devlin et al. 2018).\nDeep learning-based language models are artificial neural networks with many layers and parameters that are capable of generating meaningful texts by learning syntactic and semantic features of the natural language (Vaswani et al. 2017; Devlin et al. 2018). According to the internal, abstract representation of the input texts, these language models are able to generate text that best matches the input (Brown et al. 2020; Mikolov et al. 2013; Radford et al. 2019).\nThe textual traces of information diffusion patterns can be used to reconstruct the discursive structure of the online political space, identifying network centers and peripheries (Bryden et al. 2013) and ‘contagion patterns’ of information diffusion (Alshaabi et al. 2021; Hamilton and Hamilton 2010). By empirically scanning online political communication for language change and language polarization, and describing their characteristics and dynamics in detail, we can gain deeper insights into the ways in which public discourse operates and thus their impact on society.\nThe goal of the research is to make the models trained on the Hungarian data available together with an easy-to-use graphical user interface through which new tasks (e.g., classification and abstraction of texts) can be defined and answers gained without deep technical knowledge. The methodology developed in this research can help to pave the way for a wider sociological application of language models.\nAlshaabi, T., Dewhurst, D. R., Minot, J. R., Arnold, M. V., Adams, J.

In her 2016 book, Weapons of Math Destruction, she cites some troubling examples in the United States:\nPublic schools in Washington, D.C. in 2010 fired more than 200 teachers—including several well-respected instructors—based on scores in an algorithmic formula which evaluated performance.\nA man diagnosed with bipolar disorder was rejected for employment at seven major retailers after a third-party “personality” test deemed him a high risk based on its algorithmic classification.\nMany jurisdictions are using “predictive policing” to shift resources to likely “hot spots.” O’Neill says that depending on how data is fed into the system, this could lead to discovery of more minor crimes and a “feedback loop” which stigmatizes poor communities.\nSome courts rely on computer-ranked formulas to determine jail sentences and parole, which may discriminate against minorities by taking into account “risk” factors such as their neighborhoods and friend or family links to crime.\nIn the world of finance, brokers “scrape” data from online and other sources in new ways to make decisions on credit or insurance. This too often amplifies prejudice against the disadvantaged, O’Neil argues.\nHer findings were echoed in a White House report last year warning that algorithmic systems “are not infallible—they rely on the imperfect inputs, logic, probability, and people who design them.”\nThe report noted that data systems can ideally help weed out human bias but warned against algorithms “systematically disadvantaging certain groups.”\nZeynep Tufekci, a University of North Carolina professor who studies technology and society, said automated decisions are often based on data collected about people, sometimes without their knowledge. “These computational systems can infer all sorts of things about you from your digital crumbs,” Tufekci said in a recent TED lecture. “They can infer your sexual orientation, your personality traits, your political leanings. They have predictive power with high levels of accuracy.”\nSuch insights may be useful in certain contexts—such as helping medical professionals diagnose postpartum depression—but unfair in others, she said. Part of the problem, she said, stems from asking computers to answer questions that have no single right answer. “They are subjective, open-ended and value-laden questions, asking who should the company hire, which update from which friend should you be shown, which convict is more likely to reoffend.”\nFrank Pasquale, a University of Maryland law professor and author of The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms That Control Money and Information, shares the same concerns. He suggests one way to remedy unfair effects may be to enforce existing laws on consumer protection or deceptive practices.\nPasquale points at the European Union’s data protection law, set from next year to create a “right of explanation” when consumers are impacted by an algorithmic decision, as a model that could be expanded. This would “either force transparency or it will stop algorithms from being used in certain contexts,” he said.\nAlethea Lange, a policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology, said the E.U. plan “sounds good” but “is really burdensome” and risked proving unworkable in practice. She believes education and discussion may be more important than enforcement in developing fairer algorithms.\nLange said her organization worked with Facebook, for example, to modify a much-criticized formula that allowed advertisers to use “ethnic affinity” in their targeting.\nOthers meanwhile caution that algorithms should not be made a scapegoat for societal ills. “People get angry and they are looking for something to blame,” said Daniel Castro, vice president at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. “We are concerned about bias, accountability and ethical decisions but those exist whether you are using algorithms or not.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"concise and natural"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"multi-aspect"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"novice"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:12be3206-9633-4489-8814-ebebafaf82e5>","<urn:uuid:6ac4c8f9-4485-43b7-b764-b48a249516fb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What makes pollution reversible in most cases, and what prevention methods are recommended to stop invasive species from spreading?","answer":"Most pollution is reversible due to ecosystem resilience - over time, physico-chemical reactions and organisms can detoxify pollutants, allowing populations to recover if pollution sources are eliminated. However, some cases like nuclear disasters or invasive species are irreversible. For preventing invasive species spread, key methods include avoiding accidental movement through transportation/trade, being careful with firewood relocation, controlling ornamental plant imports, and ensuring proper containment of exotic pets. Early detection and reporting of invasive species is also crucial for protecting ecosystems.","context":["Despite catastrophic impacts on ecosystems, serious pollution such as oil spills or mercury poisoning of rivers is fortunately not irreversible, most often.\nThe resilience of ecosystems\nOver time, all of the physico-chemical reactions in the environment and the action of organisms are capable of detoxifying and eliminating chemical pollutants. If the sources of pollution are dried up, populations can gradually recover and regenerate, giving ecosystems back their functions. This is called ecosystem resilience.\nHowever, not all ecosystems are equal in the face of pollution, some being more sensitive than others. Furthermore, the more an ecosystem is degraded and under pressure (overexploitation, various pollutions, deforestation, etc.), the lower its resilience. If certain key species are affected, it can even collapse irreversibly.\nThe reversibility of pollution therefore depends on the state of health of the environment and the chronic attacks it undergoes. Man can, however, intervene to promote and accelerate the return to normalcy by fighting against sources of pollution and by initiating ecological restoration and depollution actions.\nHowever, certain types of pollution are irreversible, at least on human time scales. This is the case, for example, of Chernobyl-type nuclear disasters, the effects of which on the environment are extremely significant and lasting.\nLess extraordinary, but just as irreversible, are the biological and genetic pollution caused by invasive species. Indeed, once well established, most of these alien species become permanent members of ecosystems. Their effects are then also permanent.\nThis is the case, for example, of Caulerpa taxifolia in the Mediterranean Sea, an exotic alga that humans have been unable to prevent from settling in seagrass beds. Now, this species is part of the Mediterranean ecosystem and impoverishes the biodiversity and morphology of the environment by replacing the posidonia meadows.\nThe spectacular fall of pollution in China following the coronavirus epidemy could be seen from space. This is a striking example of how human pollution can be stopped once industrial activity is reduced. At the end of 2019, Wuhan was affected by a mysterious coronavirus and the Chinese authorities are worried. Thus they made the decision to shut down transportation to and from the city, with the objective to limit the spread of the disease. Since then, other quarantines have been declared, in China and elsewhere in the world.\nThese images show that these measures have had unintended consequences, a significant drop in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) emission. A decrease first visible on the side of Wuhan, then on the rest of the country. Traditionally, a decrease in pollution is observed during the period of the Chinese New Year festivities, but it increases again immediately after. Not this time. And the overall NO2 concentration values of 2020 around this period are lower than those of 2019. According to NASA, they are 10 to 30% lower in eastern and central China.\nThe Chinese have been breathing better for a few weeks. Emissions of CO2 and particulate matter have dropped dramatically in recent weeks, mainly due to the shutdown of many industries, traffic restrictions and domestic flights. The containment measures due to the coronavirus have thus resulted in a reduction of CO2 emissions from 15% to 40% in the industrial sector. Between February 3 and 16, China emitted 100 million tonnes of CO2 less compared to the same period of 2019.\nThe sharp reduction in industrial activities can also be seen in the level of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), which results from the combustion of fossil fuels (oil and coal). The latter fell by 36% compared to last year. At the national level, the PM2.5 rate (fine particles with a diameter of less than 2.5 µm) reached 55 μg/m3 in February, against 139 μg / m3 three days earlier. This dramatic drop is only temporary however, and emissions should rebound rapidly once activity is restored. When the epidemic has subsided, it is likely that there will be a resurgence of pollution, with factories maximizing their production to compensate for their losses after their prolonged closure, according to Greenpeace.","Tips & Modifications\nEmphasize to students that prevention and early detection are extremely important to stop invasive species from threatening our ecosystems and resources. Have students brainstorm and list ways to prevent the introduction of invasive species and methods for reporting findings of pests.\nIf possible, take students outside and help them to identify trees or vegetation and whether or not each is native/non-native, harmful/not harmful, or invasive.\nMake sure students understand that not all non-native species are invasive and harmful. To reinforce the concept, have them research one or more examples of non-native species, such as soybeans, that are not invasive species.\n1. Introduce the topic of invasive species.\nTell students that every animal and plant species has a native habitat, or environment where it naturally and normally lives and grows. Explain to students that humans sometimes relocate a species, either by accident or on purpose. Ask: What do you think might happen if a species is moved out of its native habitat and into a new environment? Then introduce the vocabulary term non-native species. Tell students that introducing a non-native species to a new ecosystem can have negative consequences—the species may become an invasive species, or a species that causes harm to the new environment.\n2. Explore the reasons people relocate species.\nAsk students to brainstorm a list of reasons people relocate species. Prompt students to include a variety of reasons, such as:\n- accidentally moving them; for example, through transportation or trade, or by moving firewood from one location to another\n- purposely introducing them to help control a native species that is considered a pest; for example, to control pests that destroy crops\n- importing ornamental plants to buy or sell\n- importing animals as pets\n3. Discuss examples of invasive animal species in the United States.\nProvide students with the following examples of invasive animal species in the United States:\n- European Starling: This bird was part of an effort to introduce to the U.S. all of the birds mentioned in the works of Shakespeare.\n- Burmese Pythons: These snakes are imported into the United States as pets. In the Florida Everglades, released or escaped pythons have established themselves in the wild.\n- Snakehead Fish: This fish was released into the wild from fish markets and has established a population in the wild.\n- Zebra Mussel: This mussel attaches itself to boats, and has spread because of boats moving between different bodies of water.\nHave students go to the USDA website and click on your state to see the invasive species in your area.\n4. Discuss examples of other invasive species in the United States.\nProvide students with the following examples of invasive plant species in the United States:\n- Kudzu: This plant is a climbing vine native to southern Japan and southeast China. Its growth is out of control in the Southeastern United States.\n- Andean Pampas Grass: This grass is native to the northern Andes, but is now a common weed near the California coast.\n- Yellow Starthistle: This plant was introduced into agricultural fields in California and is now found in almost all 48 continguous United States.\nHave students use the National Invasive Species Information Center website to find examples of invasive species that are insects, such as the emerald ash borer, or microorganisms, such as the influenza virus.\n5. Brainstorm questions about how invasive species cause harm to their new environments.\nAs a class, explore the following questions:\n- Why should we have native species?\n- When do we use non-native species?\n- What are the ecological, economic, and social impacts of invasive species?\nTell students that in a different ecosystem, a non-native species may have no natural predators to keep their numbers in balance, so they may multiply and crowd out native species or wipe out crops.

This fractal curve goes by many names “The Harter-Heighway Dragon”, “The Dragon Curve” or “The Jurassic Park Fractal”. This last name refers to this fractal’s most well known appearance, on the section title pages in the book Jurassic Park, iterating a little more in each section. This is also probably the toughest fractal to draw this week, and also features our guest artist “The Little Red-Haired Girl.”\nStep One: Draw a line. Rotate a copy of this line 90 degrees (clockwise) and attach it to the end of the first line.\nThe black line is our starting place, and the red line is the line we’ve rotated.\nStep Two: We now have an L shaped line. Rotate a copy of this ENTIRE line 90 degrees, and attach it to the end as in Step 1.\nThe number of lines it takes to draw this fractal doubles with each iteration. It is important to always rotate a copy of the entire previous shape and attach it to the end of the previous iteration.\nStep Three: We now have a backwards question mark. Rotate a copy of this ENTIRE line 90 degrees, and attach it to the end of the previous step.\nHopefully now you’re beginning to get the idea. This next iteration is where it gets a bit tricky.\nStep Four: Repeat Step Three for the ENTIRE new line we’ve constructed.\nAs you can see our rotated segment intersects with the previous step to form a box. While the Dragon Curve never crosses itself, there are a number of intersections like the one in this step.\nStep Five: Repeat Step Three for the ENTIRE new line we’ve constructed.\nBy five iterations we’re starting to get an idea of the whole shape. As in all of the previous drawings, the section in red is the rotated copy, and the black is the previous stage. Let’s see a couple more iterations:\nStep Six: Repeat Step Three for the ENTIRE new line we’ve constructed.\nStep Seven: Repeat Step Three for the ENTIRE new line we’ve constructed.\nHere’s a drawing with two more repetitions or iterations (Stage 9 of the fractal, mirror image):\nThis fractal turned out to be very difficult to draw because of the number of times it curves back on itself. While the final product took only about 20-30 minutes to draw, both of us took a crack at it for hours. Two things are important in trying to do this yourself.\n1) Draw the new stage in a different color or on a different piece of paper to always have the previous shape as a reference.\n2) Remember you are rotating the entire previous step, and always attaching it to the end (like uncurling a ribbon). You want to maintain the same rotation and direction.\nHere’s a couple more iterations using a computer:\nGoing Deeper (Dimension and Self-Similarity)\nThe Dragon Curve is an example of a space-filling curve and has a fractal dimension of 2. This essentially means the dragon fractal is a shape, a 2D object, despite the fact it is a curve that never crosses itself and does not meet at the ends.\nAlso, as you can see from our illustrations above, each new stage of the fractal contains two copies of the previous stage. This is a slightly different kind of self similarity to the Sierpinski Triangle and Koch Snowflake, which look exactly the same no matter how far you zoom in.\nObserve on the Koch Snowflake (image source: Wikipedia):\nThe Dragon curve, while not being exactly the same at all resolutions, still is constructed from previous iterations, and maintains the same basic shape.\nSidebar: Jeff Goldblum’s character in the movie Jurassic Park is a mathematician who specializes in Chaos Theory, related to the Chaos Game we played on Monday. While the Dragon Curve is a good choice for a book about dinosaurs, it is completely deterministic and not chaotic at all. The dragon will always be the same at various iterations. The Chaos Game, on the other hand, yields slightly different results each time, which resolve to the recognizable shape of the Sierpinski Triangle.\nOne more Fractal to go, our oldest fractal, The Hilbert curve.

{"question":"I work at an airport and I'm curious about display systems on planes. What are the benefits of MCDU displays for flight plans, and what safety precautions should be taken when working near aircrafts using these systems?","answer":"MCDUs (Multifunction Control Display Units) provide efficient flight plan management by enabling direct page navigation - users can quickly access specific waypoints by typing their names instead of scrolling through 40+ pages sequentially. However, when working near aircraft with operating systems, several safety precautions must be followed: stay within the pilot's view while on the ramp area, avoid smoking or open flames near operating aircraft, properly stow all equipment, and be aware of hazardous areas around turbine engine intakes and exhaust. Additionally, hearing protection is essential due to noise from various sources including aircraft, APUs, and ground equipment.","context":["FIELD OF THE INVENTION\n- Top of Page\nThe present invention generally relates to a visual display system for an aircraft, and more particularly, the present invention relates to a visual display system that produces a display with direct page navigation.\nAircraft and aircraft systems continue to advance in sophistication. Flight management systems are used on aircraft to integrate information from data sources and to perform, or assist a user in performing, functions related to, for example, navigation, flight planning, guidance and navigation, and performance management. Many aircraft have a visual display system, such as a Multifunction Control Display Unit (MCDU), coupled to the flight management system that displays a number of different screen pages in which the user can obtain information or perform functions. For example, the flight management system can display a flight plan on the MCDU.\nMCDUs may be problematic in that, generally, a user must scroll through a number of screen pages to obtain a desired portion of a flight plan or other type of information. This can be an issue because flight plans can be over 40 pages and require long sequential navigations to arrive at the desired page. This process of viewing desired information may be time consuming and inefficient, particularly because certain users often seek a particular screen page.\nAccordingly, it is desirable to provide an aircraft visual display system on which desired screen pages, particularly flight plan portions, are efficient and easy to view. Furthermore, other desirable features and characteristics of the present invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description of the invention and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and this background of the invention.\n- Top of Page\nIn accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a visual display system is provided for an aircraft having a flight plan with a plurality of flight plan pages. The system includes a display unit configured to display at least one of the flight plan pages; an input device configured to receive an input from a user corresponding to a selected flight plan page from the plurality of flight plan pages; and a processor coupled to the monitor and the input device. The processor is configured to receive the input from the input device and provide the selected flight plan page to the display unit for display based on the input.\nIn accordance with an exemplary embodiment, a method is provided for navigating to a selected flight plan page of a flight plan on a multifunctional control display unit (MCDU). The method includes receiving an input indicating the selected flight plan page; and displaying the selected flight plan page in a visual display of the MCDU.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n- Top of Page\nThe present invention will hereinafter be described in conjunction with the following drawing figures, wherein like numerals denote like elements, and\nFIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an aircraft system with a visual display system in accordance with an exemplary embodiment;\nFIG. 2 is a view of multifunction control display unit of the visual display system of FIG. 1 displaying a first flight plan page; and\nFIG. 3 is a view of multifunction control display unit of FIG. 2 displaying a second flight plan page.\n- Top of Page\nOF THE INVENTION\nThe following detailed description of the invention is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any theory presented in the preceding background of the invention or the following detailed description of the invention.\nBroadly, exemplary embodiments described herein include an aircraft visual display system with a display unit such as a multifunctional control display unit (MCDU). In accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the system enables direct page navigation of the flight plans on the MCDU. For example, a user enters a desired waypoint on the keyboard of the MCDU, and upon pressing a key such as the FPL key, the MCDU displays the flight plan page associated with that waypoint.\nFIG. 1 is a schematic representation of an aircraft system 100 with a visual display system 104 coupled to a flight management system (FMS) 102. The visual display system 104 includes a processor 116 coupled to a memory 118 and a multifunction monitor, unit, or display, such as a multifunction control display unit (MCDU) 120. The MCDU 120 displays information from the FMS 102 and enables user interaction with the FMS 102 via input devices such as a keyboard, as discussed in greater detail below. The processor 116 can be a graphics generator that generates a display on the MCDU 120 based on data stored in the memory 118 and received from the FMS 102. The visual display system 104 may further include a microphone 124 that enables audio interaction between the user, the MCDU 120, and the FMS 102. The microphone 124 may be incorporated into a headset worn by the user.\nIn general, the MCDU 120 may include one or more display monitors suitable for displaying various symbols and information. The MCDU 120 can include display devices such as, for example, cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), Heads Up Display (HUD), and Helmet Monitored Display (HMD). The MCDU 120 is preferably interactive, and as such, includes a keyboard, touch-screen and/or other mechanisms for function, display, and/or cursor control. The MCDU 120 is discussed in greater detail below with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3.\nThe processor 116 encompasses one or more functional blocks used to interact with the FMS 102, memory 118, microphone 124, and MCDU 120. In this regard, processor 116 may include any number of individual microprocessors, memories, storage devices, interface cards, and other components. The memory 118 can be any suitable type of memory or data storage, such as for example, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory, CD, DVD, or other optical storage, magnetic storage devices, or any other medium that can be used to store and access desired information by the processor 116. As discussed in greater detail below, the memory 118 may store logic that enables direct page navigation of the flight plan on the MCDU 120.\nThe FMS 102 includes an FMS processor 106. The FMS processor 106 is configured to communicate with the visual display system 104 and one or more data sources 114. Similar to the display system processor 116, the FMS processor 106 may include any number of individual microprocessors, memories, storage devices, interface cards, and other components.\nThe data sources 114 can include avionics data 108 and at least one airline modifiable information (AMI) file 112. Avionics data 108 includes aeronautical information related to the state of the aircraft derived from an aeronautical information database, including, for example, flight plan data, data related to airways, navigational aids, navigational data, obstructions, taxi registration, Special Use Airspace, political boundaries, COM frequencies (en route and airports), approach information, geographical information and the like.\nThe FMS 102 integrates information from data sources 114 shown in FIG. 1, as well as additional data sources such as input from the pilot or other users, inertial references, navigation radio, and engine and fuel sensors, to perform or assist in functions such as navigation, flight planning, performance management, guidance and control, datalink communications, and display data processing. Particularly, the FMS 102 utilizes the data from the AMI file 112 to provide runtime parameters to the visual display system 104.\nThe processor 116 of the visual display system 104 receives the runtime parameters provided by the FMS 102 to produce a display on the MCDU 120. Through the use of the MCDU 120, microphone 124, or other peripherals of the visual display system 104, the user can interact with the elements displayed on the MCDU 120 graphically and/or textually.\nFIG. 2 is a view of the MCDU 120 of the visual display system 104 of FIG. 1 displaying a first flight plan page, and FIG. 3 is a view of the MCDU 120 displaying a second flight plan page. Referring to both FIGS. 2 and 3, the MCDU 120 includes a display portion 204 for displaying a current screen page that includes information relating to navigation and control of the aircraft. As shown in FIG. 2, the current screen page in the display portion 204 is an active flight plan page. In general, a flight plan is a detailed description of the path to be followed by an aircraft during a scheduled flight. In particular, the flight plan is a chronological sequence of waypoints described by their name, their position, their altitude and the time they are overflown or sequenced. Characteristics of the flight plan and display of the list of waypoints will be discussed in greater detail below.\nThe current screen page in the display portion 204 can be changed or manipulated by pressing one or more mode keys 206. The mode keys 206 are each associated with one or more screen pages or functions that can be displayed in the display portion 204. Line select keys 208 along the side of the display portion 204 enable the user to perform functions, with mode key selected, that include associated with the navigation and control of the aircraft specific to the screen page displayed in the display portion 204. For example, the line select keys 208 allow the user to navigate the screens, enter flight plan data, performance data, and navigation data, as well as initiating functions such as printing the flight plan and aligning the inertial reference system.\nA multifunction keyboard 210 is formed by a keypad device that includes, for example, the alphabet, numbers from zero to nine, mathematical operator keys, decimal, clear, delete, space, etc. Moreover, the multifunction keyboard 210 may include any number of additional knobs, switches, buttons, keys, and the like, all of which may be configured to implement an effective interface between the user and the FMS 102 (FIG. 1).\nThe MCDU 120 further includes a scratchpad area 212. The scratchpad area 212 may be, for example, part of the display portion 204 or any other suitable electronic display device. The scratchpad area 212 generally operates to display the data being entered into the multifunction keyboard 210 by the user, such that the user may monitor the data for accuracy as it is being typed.\nIn the example illustrated in FIG. 2, the MCDU 120 displays the first page of a nine page flight plan. In this example, the first page of the active flight plan lists five waypoints, e.g., “ZILLA”, “CHEZZ,” and so on. In some embodiments, the flight plans may be 40 or more pages. In conventional MCDUs, if a user wanted to, for example, view a waypoint that was not displayed on the first page, the user would have to press the NEXT key of the mode keys 206. Pressing the NEXT key sequentially scrolls through the pages of the flight plan. The user would continually scroll through the flight plan pages and scan the listed waypoints, until the user identifies the desired waypoint.\nIn accordance with an exemplary embodiment, the user may request a particular page of the flight plan by entering the request into the multifunction keyboard 210. For example, if the user wants to view the flight plan page that includes the waypoint “NATHN,” the user types the phrase “NATHN” into the multifunction keyboard 210, and the phrase is displayed in the scratchpad area 212 of the display portion 204. The user then presses the FPL key of the mode keys 206. In an alternate embodiment, other mode keys or actuating functions may be used. In response, the MCDU 120 displays the flight plan page that includes the “NATHN” waypoint. As shown in the exemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, the “NATHN” waypoint is included on page six of the flight plan. As such, the MCDU 120 jumps directly to a non-sequential, desired flight plan page with a single command instead of requiring the user to scroll through a number of pages.\nIn another exemplary embodiment, it is not necessary for the user to enter the complete waypoint to jump to a desired flight plan page. For example, if the user enters “NAT,” and no other waypoints in flight plan start with “NAT,” the MCDU 120 will jump to the flight plan page with the “NATHN” waypoint. In some embodiments, the MCDU 120 may provide a selection of waypoints in a drop down menu. For example, if the user enters “N” into the scratchpad and presses the FPL key, the MCDU 120 displays all of the waypoints on the flight plan page that begin with the letter “N.” The user then selects the desired “NATHN” waypoint from the menu, and the MCDU 120 displays the flight plan page with the “NATHN” waypoint.\nAccordingly, direct page navigation is accessible according to waypoint name. Referring additionally to FIG. 1, in general, the processor 102 uses page logic within the memory 118 of the display system 104 that contains a flight plan list from which the waypoint names can be sorted to identify the appropriate flight plan page. If necessary, the processor 106 of the FMS 102 can query lateral path construction and database management to assist in direct page navigation.\nIn further exemplary embodiments, the MCDU 120 responds to further user commands, such as those that indicate a desired page position within the flight plan. For example, if the user types the phrase “MID” into multifunction keyboard 210 and presses the FPL key, the MCDU 120 displays the midpoint of the flight plan, e.g., page five of the nine page flight plan. As another example, if the user types the phrase “END” into multifunction keyboard 210, which is displayed in scratchpad 212, and presses the FPL key, the MCDU 120 displays the last page of the flight plan, e.g., page nine of the nine page flight plan. In a further exemplary embodiment, if the user types a page number into the multifunction keyboard 210 and presses the FPL key, the MCDU 120 displays the requested page. For example, if the user types “6” and presses the FPL key, the MCDU 120 displays page six of the flight plan. As another example, if the user types the phrase “DISCON” into multifunction keyboard 210, which is displayed in scratchpad 212, and presses the FPL key, the MCDU 120 displays the flight plan page that contains a discontinuity in the flight plan. If the user attempts to go to a waypoint or command display screen that is not part of the flight plan, such a data entry would be rejected by the MCDU 120 and the previously displayed data would remain unchanged.\nAs an alternative or in addition to using the multifunction keyboard 210 and mode or line select keys 206, 208, the user may input instructions via the microphone 124 (FIG. 1). The user can activate the MCDU 120 to receive audio instructions via a designated keystroke or other physical input or a predetermined audible command. The MCDU 120 may provide a visible indication that the visual display system 104 is in audio mode.\nThe processor 116 may execute a speech recognition program that translates the speech into digital signals representing text. The digital signals may then be used as the alphanumeric entry on the scratchpad area 212 to direct the MCDU 120 to the desired page. In other embodiments, the spoken command itself is not displayed.\nIn one embodiment, the user can spell out the desired waypoint, such as “N,” then “A,” and so on, using the example of FIG. 2. In an alternate embodiment, the user can request the desired waypoint itself, such as “NATHN.” Additionally, the user can speak or spell the other designated commands, such as “MID,” “END,” or “DISCON.” In each of these uses, the processor 116 identifies the appropriate page corresponding to the designated waypoint or command and displays this page.\nIn one exemplary embodiment, designated commands such as those discussed above are stored in an AMI data table that forms part of the AMI file 112 or a data table stored in memory 118, as illustrated by FIG. 1. In other words, text commands, such as “MID,” “END,” and numeric commands are page mapped with a text list that identifies designated flight plan pages. In these cases, the user may utilize a ground based software tool (GBST) or user application definition files (UADF) to modify the display and function of the MCDU 120, including the accessible text commands Typically, the FMS 102 reads the data in the AMI file 112 and provides runtime parameters to the visual display system 104, which enables the MCDU 120 to directly navigate desired flight plan pages. In general, any suitable mechanism for linking MCDU inputs with flight plan pages may be provided.\nAccordingly, exemplary embodiments enable direct page navigation of the flight plans on the MCDU. This permits the aircraft operator to focus on the task of appropriately routing the aircraft instead of focusing on scrolling through the flight plan pages of the MCDU. As such, exemplary embodiments decrease flight crew “heads-down” time, ease pilot workload, and improve the efficiency with which pilots operate their aircraft.\nWhile at least one exemplary embodiment has been presented in the foregoing detailed description of the invention, it should be appreciated that a vast number of variations exist. It should also be appreciated that the exemplary embodiment or exemplary embodiments are only examples, and are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the invention in any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for implementing an exemplary embodiment of the invention. It being understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements described in an exemplary embodiment without departing from the scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.","The flight line is a place of dangerous activity. Technicians who perform maintenance on the flight line must constantly be aware of what is going on around them. The noise on a flight line comes from many places. Aircraft are only one source of noise. There are auxiliary power units (APUs), fuel while the blades are turning, adhere to the following trucks, baggage handling equipment, and so forth. Each has guidelines to ensure safety. its own frequency of sound. Combined all together, the noise on the ramp or flight line can cause hearing loss.\nThere are many types of hearing protection available. Hearing protection can be external or internal. Earmuffs or headphones are considered external protection. The internal type of hearing protection fits into the auditory canal. Both types reduce the sound level reaching the eardrum and reduce the chances of hearing loss.\nHearing protection is essential when working with pneumatic drills, rivet guns, or other loud tools. Even short duration exposure to these sounds can cause hearing loss because of their high frequency. Continued exposure will cause hearing loss.\nForeign Object Damage (FOD)\nForeign object damage (FOD) is any damage to aircraft, personnel, or equipment caused by any loose object. These loose objects can be anything, such as broken runway concrete, shop towels, safety wire, etc. To control FOD, keep ramp and operation areas clean, have a tool control program, and provide convenient receptacles for used hardware, shop towels, and other consumables.\nNever leave tools or other items around the intake of a turbine engine. The modern gas turbine engine creates a low-pressure area in front of the engine that causes any loose object to be drawn into the engine. The exhaust of these engines can propel loose objects great distances with enough force to damage anything that is hit. The importance of a FOD program cannot be overstressed when a technician considers the cost of engines, components, or a human life.\nSafety Around Airplanes\nAs with the previously mentioned items, it is important to be aware of propellers. Technicians cannot assume the pilot of a taxiing aircraft can see them and must stay within the pilot’s view while on the ramp area. Turbine engine intakes and exhaust can also be very hazardous areas. Smoking or open flames are not permitted anywhere near an aircraft in operation. Be aware of aircraft fluids that can be detrimental to skin. When operating support equipment around aircraft, be sure to allow space between it and the aircraft, and secure it so it cannot roll into the aircraft. All items in the area of operating aircraft must be stowed properly.\nSafety Around Helicopters\nEvery type of helicopter has different features. These differences must be learned to avoid damaging the helicopter or injuring the technician. When approaching a helicopter while the blades are turning, adhere to the following guidelines to ensure safety.\n- Observe the rotor head and blades to see if they are level. This allows maximum clearance when approaching the helicopter.\n- Approach the helicopter in view of the pilot.\n- Never approach a helicopter carrying anything with a vertical height that the blades could hit. This could cause blade damage and injury to the individual.\n- Never approach a single-rotor helicopter from the rear. The tail rotor is invisible when operating.\n- Never go from one side of the helicopter to the other by going around the tail. Always go around the nose of the helicopter.\nWhen securing the rotor on helicopters with elastomeric bearings, check the maintenance manual for the proper method. Using the wrong method could damage the bearing.\nPerforming maintenance on aircraft and their components requires the use of electrical tools that can produce sparks, heat-producing tools and equipment, flammable and explosive liquids, and gases. As a result, a high potential exists for fire to occur. Measures must be taken to prevent a fire from occurring and to have a plan for extinguishing it.\nThe key to fire safety is knowledge of what causes a fire, how to prevent it, and how to put it out. This knowledge must be instilled in each technician, emphasized by their supervisors through sound safety programs, and occasionally practiced.

What's the difference between the user focus in design-to-improve-life methodology and problem-based learning techniques?","answer":"In the Design to Improve Life methodology, the user is explicitly placed at the center of attention throughout the process, with students designing solutions specifically for people's needs and studying users as their starting point. In problem-based learning, while also user-centered, the focus is more on students as autonomous learners who construct their own knowledge through real-life problem solving. Both approaches emphasize real-world application, but Design to Improve Life specifically structures work around user impact parameters, while problem-based learning organizes content around problems rather than hierarchical topics.","context":["The Design to Improve Life compass consists of four phases that can unfold into six layers, where you start by moving from the outer layer, focused on the user and the four phases to the inner layer, where you find concrete techniques that support the actions your students go through in the different phases. The Compass represents a holistic and non-linear process that alternates between repetitions and progressions related to the goal, form and content.\nThe user is always the center of attention in the Design to Improve Life process. The users are the people you design solutions for, thus the interest in and the study of the user are the starting point and purpose of the collected design process.\nThe Design to Improve Life process covers four defined phases (Prepare, Perceive, Prototype and Produce). Each phase is finished off with a Sum Up which summarizes and evaluates the finished phase. Here the students reflect and give each other feedback on their work.\nIn the Prepare phase, the students are introduced to Design to Improve Life and are divided into resourceful design teams where they distribute responsibility and roles. They then identify possible challenges to work with and concretize the specific challenge, they want to work with. This phase focuses especially on the Impact parameter, which focuses on challenges that have a negative effect on people’s lives.\nIn the Perceive phase the students are taught to refine and understand their chosen challenge and the potential users and target groups – what their needs and wants are, and which challenges should be solved through the design. This phase focuses on the Context parameter – on the environment the design has to work within, the people who are affected by the challenge and in which way they are affected: How the culture, geography and infrastructure are in the local context.\nIn the Prototype phase the students should develop ideas on how to solve the chosen challenge, and they should start to develop and visualize their designs using models and sketches. They should test their ideas and solutions on the users, make mistakes and possibly start over, while they evaluate and reflect in their development and learning. The phase focuses on the Form parameter, since the students are now working with developing and shaping their ideas.\nIn the Produce phase the students gather all the material they have produced in the previous phases in order to gain an overview of the process. Based on the students’ material, they prepare a presentation of their design process and their design solution. The teacher should by this time have communicated the framework of the presentation, based on the overall focus and goal of the process. In the last Sum Up of the process, the individual design teams’ work is evaluated based on all three Design to Improve Life parameters: Form, Impact and Context.\nThe Compass includes twelve different actions – three in each phase. The actions are developed to make them as relevant for the work the students have to do, and for the learning goals attached to the individual phase. In the Compass, the actions are visualized using pictograms.\nEvery action is supported by different types of techniques, e.g. Open Space and Idea Poker, which help the students explore, analyze, develop, reassess and improve their designs. In addition, several Joker techniques can be used when/if the students get stuck in the process or need new approaches for their projects.\nThe Design to Improve Life parameters\nWithin the process, the students will analyze, assess and choose the challenge they wish to develop a solution for based on the three parameters: Form, Impact and Context. As described in the Produce phase, the students focus on all three parameters to enable evaluation of the process, while focus is on the individual parameters in the three previous phases.\nDuring Design to Improve Life processes the students (or the teacher) will experience, that they get stuck in the process because they lose focus, get set on a single idea or challenge, or disagree and become frustrated with the process. This is completely normal and an inevitable part of the process. The Jokers provide a series of tools and techniques to deal with such situations.\nWhile the students complete a Design to Improve Life process, they have to keep a Logbook that includes their reflections and learning. The Logbook could for instance be a notebook, where the teacher has written several questions for the students to think about. The teacher develops the questions, which should focus on the procedural progress the students experience in the design teams, reflections of learning and the quality of the design team.\nExamples of questions for the Logbook could be:\n- What have you and your design team learned in this phase?\n- Have you experienced strengths and weaknesses when working in design teams?\n- Can you use what you have already learned in the next phase?\nThe Logbook is the students’ personal tool, but it is mandatory that they reflect over the questions prior to each phase’s Sum Up. The reflections of the Logbook are actively used in connection with the Sum Ups and the final presentation in the Produce phase. The teacher can choose to collect the logbooks during the process to gain insights into how the students work.","BY LAURA RIGOLOSI & SHERRISH HOLLOMAN\nProblems. There’s no shortage of them these days — the pandemic has spurred countless challenges and intense despair; there are too many to list. Teaching during the pandemic has been a challenge in and of itself, as we are always looking for ways for students to be engaged with curricula and drive their learning, and that’s hard to do whether we’re teaching in person or remotely.\nIf you think back to your college or grad school days, you may recall the constructivist thinkers, such as Jean Piaget, who believed that students learn best when they construct their own learning. Problem- and project-based learning offers teachers an opportunity to do just that — instead of telling students the answers, you can create a learning environment in which students learn through discovery, thinking, tinkering, reflecting, and developing answers on their own.\nWe may already be familiar with ways that we can bring this type of learning to in-person classrooms, but it can also be delivered to students who are learning in remote or blended environments.\nProblem-based learning vs. project-based learning\nProject-based learning is situated in real-life learning. The Buck Institute for Education defines project-based learning as a “teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging, and complex question, problem or challenge.” If you ever walk into a classroom and see students working on a project with an exciting buzz in the room, chances are, their teachers have designed a project-based learning task.\nIn our own lives, we know that when working on a project, we often discover a problem we didn’t realize we had — but once it surfaces, it demands a solution. (Remember those early pandemic days when we were acclimating to teaching remotely, but also trying to solve the problem of having no dedicated teaching space at home?) In teaching, this idea rings true, too. As we are learning more about a topic, we may discover a problem alongside our students, and this is the breeding ground for an exciting new project. This is the foundation of problem-based learning.\nProblem-based learning also offers students real-life learning opportunities, as well as the chance “to think creatively and bring their knowledge to bear in unique ways” (2020 Schunk, p. 64). Problem-based learning can look differently depending on the content and grade level, but often includes group discussions that allow for multiple perspectives on a topic, a simulated situation that involves role playing, or group work that includes both collaborative work and time to complete tasks individually.\nProblem-based learning promotes autonomous learning, self-assessment skills, planning time, project work, and oral and written expression skills. According to a July 2020 article from the Hechinger Report, problem-based learning has gained tremendous momentum, because it allows students to work more freely and at their own pace — a key advantage when learning remotely. In problem-based learning, the content and skills are organized around problems, rather than as a hierarchical list of topics. It’s also inherently learner-centered because the learner actively creates their own knowledge as they attempt to solve the problem.\nPutting the “Problem” into Practice\nAs former English teachers, we both understand the challenge of putting new professional learning into practice. For teachers who need a refresher on how to design a problem-based learning experience for their students, Problem Based Learning: Six Steps to Design, Implement and Assess breaks down the steps to move PBL into practice as follows:\nTo help put these problem-based steps into perspective, we can look to our recent work with partners from a high school in the South Bronx. The chemistry team there decided to use an anti-racist lens while addressing a problem that was very real to their students — fireworks. During the summer of 2020, there was a record number of firework incidents in New York City. According to an article in the New York Times, the city received over 1,700 fireworks complaints in the first half of June alone. Our partners used this problem as an opportunity for students to research fireworks from multiple lenses, and imagine how they might present their findings and recommendations to local officials. After all, shouldn’t New York Governor Andrew Cuomo hear from high school students in the Bronx about the effects fireworks have on their communities?\nHere’s what the framework might look like in this example:\nFrom here, we can imagine the possibilities for this framework, considering how students might address the underlying problem from different perspectives and content areas:\nTeaching and learning throughout a global pandemic has presented more than its share of challenges. Out of necessity, tremendous innovation has taken place with the use of technology, pedagogy, and curriculum. With problem-based learning, we can continue this innovation in our classrooms, offering our students opportunities to solve real world problems, demonstrate critical thinking, and collaborate with their peers. We would love to hear what problem-based learning tasks you are designing for your classrooms!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"concise and natural"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"multi-aspect"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"novice"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9a2e85ec-38ff-4ca7-97dd-cef92f39b974>","<urn:uuid:2285de50-3939-41b9-a10b-f1d64c1e528a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key challenges in museum digital collections management, and how do these relate to environmental sustainability concerns in cultural tourism?","answer":"Museum digital collections face challenges including haphazard development, uneven digitization due to shifting priorities and funding issues, varying quality of digital files, and inconsistent cataloging standards. These need to be evaluated through quality assessment of digital files, verification of cataloging information, and ensuring representative sampling across collections. Meanwhile, cultural tourism faces environmental sustainability challenges, as tourism development puts pressure on ecosystems through pollution and infrastructure damage. The tourism industry contributes to 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, including through hotel operations and construction, while also potentially damaging vital marine ecosystems that are essential for maintaining ecological diversity.","context":["For many of the museums I’ve worked in (and with, as a consultant), the development of digital collections was haphazard. The evolution of museum collections management software, digitization technology, and issues such as digital preservation and storage have all contributed to an uneven approach to publishing digital collections online.\nShifting priorities, lack of stable funding, and the absence of a uniform methodology from the outset have further added to the lopsided appearance of digital collections.\nPeriodic evaluation of a museum collection’s digital presence should be undertaken in order to ensure that the museum’s mission and goals are supported by the quantity and quality of the objects available through the collections management system (CMS). If the museum doesn’t already have a system of evaluation in place, the following four questions should be considered:\n1. Is the quality of the digital files acceptable?\nThis is usually the first, noticeable issue with digital surrogates of museum objects. Due to the improvement, availability, and decreasing cost of digitization equipment, museums today are better outfitted to capture high-quality digital object files. Digital capturing that took place 5, 10, 15 or more years ago will not hold up nearly as well in terms of quality and should be considered for a re-shoot. Many museums follow a set of quality standards dependent upon the type of digital file being created (.jpeg, .tif, .pdf, .mp4, etc.) and these standards should be considered when reviewing older digital images. It is important for digital files to be of high-quality since optimum quality files will encourage more digital user interaction, and will provide the best possible files for future digital migration and preservation.\n2. Is the cataloging information correct and does it meet industry standards?\nCatalog information—the quantity and the quality—is perhaps the most varied aspect when considering a museum’s digital collection. Different projects, staff transitions, availability of information, and the structure of the museum collections management system can all impact the way a museum object is cataloged. The museum’s set of cataloging guidelines should be up-to-date with industry standards and any internal standards the museum has elected to follow. Catalog records of collection objects should be compared with the guidelines in order to determine whether they meet the museum’s standards. Catalog records that fail to meet the minimum requirements should be updated.\n3. Does the CMS contain an accurate, representative sample across all areas of the museum collection?\nA museum with an even representation of the collection within the collections management system is rare. Changing priorities, staff transition, unstable funding, and exhibits of any given year can lead to imbalanced creation of the museum digital collection. For example, one area of the museum collection can have 100% of its objects digitized and cataloged online, while other areas only receive a minimal level of digitization or none at all. This is a common scenario and one that museum staff should strive to rectify in order to create a more accurate and representative account of the museum collections online.\n4. Are there areas of the catalog record that are optional, but could be used to improve access and enjoyment of the object?\nWhile a catalog record can meet museum requirements, it may be improved upon with the use of additional descriptive fields. For example, are there museum objects that may be difficult for visitors to understand, or that could be further enjoyed if more information was supplied? Adding additional descriptive information to promote access and enjoyment of a museum object should be considered as time and resources allow.\nIt’s natural to look forward to new projects and ideas, and it’s easy to discount the need to review past digitization work. However, museum staff owe it to their collection and to their digital users to evaluate their museum’s digital collection and improve upon past work to promote accessibility, use, and enjoyment of the museum collection online.\nRachael Cristine Woody\nRachael Cristine Woody has helped with museum cataloging and collections management at institutions like the Freer|Sackler Museum of the Smithsonian Institution and the Oregon Wine History Archive at Linfield College. Read more of Rachael’s posts on museum collections and management. See also more information on Lucidea’s solutions for museum collections management systems.\nFor each museum digitization project, research and identify equipment and software tools, outline and commit to standards, keep end result(s) in mind\nDigitization standards for file resolution and formats should be intentionally thought of and committed to prior to any museum digitization project.\nBefore a museum collections digitization project, assess what types of items you have and therefore, what digitization tools you need.\nThe second post in a series on the Harryhausen Titan of Cinema Experience analyzing the specific pivot to an online virtual exhibition during COVID","Today Minister Bartlett delivered his keynote address at the Latin American and Caribbean Development Bank ( CAF) session, making it official in his speech suggesting:\nWe are Caribbean, we are the Solution:\nTranscript: Hon. Edmund Bartlett speech:\nAs the disruptive impact of climate change is projected to intensify for economies dependent on tourism, particularly in the Caribbean—the most tourism-dependent region in the world — there is widespread acknowledgment that an urgent shift in the values, attitudes, and behaviors of all involved in the tourism chain is imperative.\nThis collective reorientation of purpose is necessary to steer tourism toward a more balanced, resilient, and sustainable trajectory. This vision will be achieved by redressing current practices and trends in the industry that contribute to the imprudent use of limited natural resources and contribute to the misalignment of economic growth with the conservation of both land and ocean and marine ecosystems.\nUltimately, the thrust toward sustainable, resilient, and balanced tourism emphasizes the integration of environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient practices into every facet of the tourism product —from building design, construction, accommodation, and other room services to transportation marketing, recreational activities, energy use, food production, customer service, waste management, maintenance, water supply, and utility consumption.\nThe Caribbean region has been specifically recognized by the United Nations Secretary-General as ground-zero for the global climate change emergency as he emphasized that small island low-lying coastal states in the Caribbean are exceptionally susceptible to what he described as the “most significant challenge confronting our world today”- the climate crisis.\nSimilarly, the UNDP recently projected that the Caribbean will become the world’s most vulnerable tourist destination between 2025 and 2050. This prediction stems from the observation that the impacts of climate change and global warming will continue to produce dire consequences for the fragile and undiversified economies of the Caribbean.\nIndeed, although Latin America and the Caribbean account for only 10 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, the region is at the forefront of global efforts to tackle climate change due to its disproportionate impact which includes a higher occurrence of the most intense tropical cyclones (TCs), storm surges, droughts, changing rainfall patterns, sea-level rise (SLR), warmer temperatures, biodiversity loss, flooding, saline intrusion into aquifers, food and water insecurity, beach erosion coastal degradation, mangrove loss, coral bleaching, and the growth of invasive species.\nClimate change constitutes a major threat to coastal and marine tourism which is the backbone of Caribbean countries, accounting for a quarter of the total economy, and a fifth of all jobs.\nAdmittedly, the relationship between tourism and the environment in the Caribbean is complex since the tourism industry presents both a challenge and an opportunity for achieving environmental sustainability. Healthy marine and coastal systems are critical assets to the region’s tourism competitiveness.\nThe region’s tourism product that has been traditionally built around the sun, sea, and sand” concept relies on the environmental resources or natural endowments of the region to attract international travelers.\nThis is against the backdrop that coastal and marine tourism is the largest economic sector in the Caribbean with over 80 percent of tourism occurring along coastal towns and cities. Healthy coastal and marine ecosystems also serve as vital sources of food, income, trade and shipping, minerals, energy, water supply, recreation, and tourism for these small island economies.\nThe coral reef-mangrove-seagrass complex also brings increased safety to coastal communities and infrastructure such as hotels and resorts as these systems act as a natural barrier, decreasing the impact of floods and storms.\nOn the other hand, marine and coastal ecosystems are also significantly threatened by tourism development.\nWEF estimated that the global tourism industry is responsible for a staggering 8% of all global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including flights, hotel construction and operation, air conditioning and heating, and land and maritime transport.\nThe areas that attract tourists have been coming under increasing pressure from the damage and pollution caused by tourist facilities and the supporting infrastructure.\nAt the same time, the impacts of climate change, overfishing, other unsustainable practices, and even some marine tourism activities damage marine ecosystems such as coral reefs which are vital for maintaining ecological diversity and regulating climate.\nThe United Nations has estimated the cost of reduced tourism due to coral bleaching at $12 billion annually.\nGiven the context outlined, there is now a greater imperative among Caribbean tourist destinations to improve the management of vital marine and ocean ecosystems.\nThis can be achieved through the adoption of the blue economy pathway.\nThe World Bank defines the Blue Economy as “the sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, and ocean ecosystem health.”\nThis definition imposes moral responsibility on all industries, especially those that significantly harness or exploit ocean and marine resources in their value chains, to make greater efforts to protect fragile and gradually depleting ocean and marine systems that have become increasingly susceptible to man-made phenomena such as ocean pollution, shipping and transport, dredging, offshore drilling, deep-sea mining, over-fishing and the degradation of coastal and marine ecosystems linked to sea level rise/global warming.\nCaribbean tourist destinations can take the lead in global efforts that champion the blue economy and climatic resilience.\nThey are uniquely positioned to achieve value creation through differentiation and diversification of their tourism product since the region offers significant opportunities for the development of potentially lucrative niche tourism segments that balance environmental sustainability and ecological conservation with economic development.\nThese include health and wellness, medical, culture and heritage, eco-tourism, and wildlife or nature tourism.\nThe creative and cultural industries that Caribbean destinations are renowned for can be leveraged to not only bolster the regional economy but also to reduce the carbon footprint associated with long-distance imports.\nThere are also significant opportunities for Caribbean tourist entities to incorporate sustainable energy sources that are naturally available in the region such as solar power, wind, geothermal, or biomass into tourism infrastructure to reduce the sector’s reliance on fossil fuels, contributing to a more climate-resilient energy framework.\nMany Caribbean tourist destinations have already been at the forefront of implementing solutions that actively support the preservation and health of ocean and marine ecosystems.\nThrough a multifaceted approach, some destinations have championed initiatives such as coral reef restoration projects and mangrove conservation efforts.\nPartnerships with local communities, governmental bodies, and conservation organizations have led to the establishment of marine protected areas, fostering safe havens for marine life to thrive.\nCollaborations with local communities and NGOs have led to beach clean-up campaigns and waste management programs, significantly reducing marine debris and pollution.\nFurthermore, education and awareness initiatives integrated into tourism experiences have raised visitors’ consciousness about the importance of preserving these ecosystems, encouraging responsible behavior, and fostering a deeper appreciation for the oceans’ health and biodiversity.\nEncouraging sustainable diving and snorkeling practices, promoting responsible tourism guidelines that safeguard delicate marine habitats, and advocating for reduced plastic usage have also been integral parts of their strategies.\nIn Jamaica, the government’s ban on single-use plastic bags, straws, and polystyrene has set a precedent for responsible environmental stewardship that has positively influenced conservationist attitudes in the tourism industry.\nIn closing, I want to reiterate that preserving the marine and ocean ecosystems and fortifying resilience against climate change is not just a choice for Caribbean destinations—it is a priority.\nThese actions safeguard not only the region’s natural assets but also the livelihoods and cultural heritage intertwined with these ecosystems. By taking proactive measures and fostering sustainability, Caribbean destinations can pave the way for a resilient future, inspiring global efforts toward environmental conservation.\nThe significance of these endeavors extends far beyond local borders, shaping a world where harmony between humans and nature is paramount for a sustainable tomorrow.\nWhat is COP28?\nThe 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, more commonly referred to as COP28, is the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference, being held from 30 November until 12 December 2023 at Expo City, Dubai."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"concise and natural"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"multi-aspect"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7aaf33a5-3e2a-47cc-93fd-6ef6064904bb>","<urn:uuid:ac4176ec-39c0-441c-8623-5eb02b2099e0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Ruth Asawa's wire sculptures and Jackson Pollock's action paintings differ in their approach to artistic space?","answer":"Asawa used continuous lines of wire to create three-dimensional forms that played with physical space, allowing viewers to conjure imagined spaces through transparency and hanging forms that defied gravity. In contrast, Pollock's action paintings employed an 'all-over' style that avoided points of emphasis within the canvas, abandoning traditional composition and treating the entire two-dimensional surface as a unified field for his dripped and splattered paint.","context":["Ruth Asawa’s story is one of extraordinary creativity in the face of adversity. Born in California in 1926, her life was shaped, like her art, by social and political impositions; by unjust restrictions on her liberties and supposed inalienable rights.\nAs a teenager in the early 1940’s, Asawa and her family were sent by Executive Order to an internment camp with approximately 120,000 fellow Japanese Americans. Under the tutelage of professional artists also held captive, Asawa began to make art, finding in it a sense of liberation at a time when the government had stripped her of her civil liberties.\nDespite the suffering she endured, Asawa exhibited great humility and, 50 years after the event, felt little resentment, saying: ‘I hold no hostilities for what happened; I blame no one. Sometimes good comes through adversity. I would not be who I am today had it not been for the internment, and I like who I am.’\nRuth Asawa, Untitled (SF.003, Undulating Parallelograms), circa 1951–1952.

(33 x 31 cm.)\nFollowing the close of the Second World War, in 1947, Asawa set off on a tour to Mexico, where she was captivated by the looped-wire baskets used in markets to sell eggs and other produce. Intrigued by the material’s potential as an artistic medium, she began to loop and twist wire, using continuous lines to create three-dimensional forms that appeared to play with space in which they hung.\nAsawa continued her formal artistic education at North Carolina’s Black Mountain College, studying alongside a group of artists who would grow to be amongst the 21st century’s most influential. ‘The late 1940s and early 1950s at Black Mountain were the now legendary institution’s most glorious years,’ comments Robert Storr. ‘Refugee Bauhaus master Josef Albers was at the centre of Black Mountain’s program, bringing diverse talents to the remote community both as teachers and as students.’\nBlack Mountain’s illustrious teaching staff included Merce Cunningham and Buckminster Fuller; Willem and Elaine de Kooning would later join the summer faculty, along with Franz Kline, and artists Robert Rauschenberg and Cy Twombly were amongst the student body. The institution’s Modernist and Bauhaus currents became a visible influence in Asawa’s practice, with the Bauhaus notion of transparency — allowing the viewer to conjure imagined spaces — a prominent aspect of works that cut and shape space.\nInstallation view, Ruth Asawa: Objects & Apparitions, Christie’s, 6–31 May 2013. Artwork: © Estate of Ruth Asawa\nOther aspects of the school influenced more than just Asawa’s visual language: Whilst there, the artist churned buttermilk daily, the activity forming part of a communal commitment to working for the ‘greater good’. The creed was one that Asawa continued to live by, even after leaving Black Mountain for a new life in San Francisco. Christie’s specialist Jonathan Laib comments: ‘Her art, her family, her garden, her activism—each seemingly grew to fuller capacity due to the existence of the other, not in spite of it’.\nFor Laib, Asawa’s works represent a ‘new sculptural invention,’ leaving flat canvas to explore the idea of ‘drawing in space’. ‘The wire served a purpose in assisting to explore space within and without,’ says Laib. ‘It was an “experiment” that created sculptures of a most articulate and stunning visual revelation…Stringing them from the ceiling in defiance of gravity revealed yet another great leap of faith and imagination’.\nRuth Asawa, Untitled (WC.046, Pink Orchid), 1995.

(23 x 16 cm.)\nDiscussing her practice in 1995, Asawa said: ‘My curiosity was aroused by the idea of giving structural form to the images in my drawings. These forms come from observing plants, the spiral shell of a snail, seeing light through insect wings, watching spiders repair their webs in the early morning, and seeing the sun through the droplets of water suspended from the tips of pine needles while watering my garden.’\n‘Throughout her life Asawa drew,’ says Laib. ‘Many of her most celebrated drawings were created during her stay at Black Mountain College or slightly thereafter during her early days in San Francisco. Overlooked are her botanical and figurative drawings made from direct observation. Seldom shown, these works deserve a closer look and greater consideration within the larger context of her artistic life’.\nFeaturing works from across artist’s career, Line by Line explores the interplay between Asawa’s two dimensional and sculptural work, whose concern with space has prompted comparisons to the Spatial Concepts of Lucio Fontana and the revolutionary hanging mobiles of sculptor Alexander Calder.\nRuth Asawa, Untitled (SD.070, Tied Wire Tree with 5-pointed Star in Center).

(55 x 68 x 68 cm.)\n‘What is so surreal about Asawa’s work is the very fact that her art was every bit as outrageous as that of other, equally obsessive artists, such as Yayoi Kusama for example, but she maintained a nuanced life of modest responsibility,’ comments Laib. ‘Imogen Cunningham has taken many incredible photographs of Ruth. In nearly all she is working or caught in a rare moment between taping her fingers and bending more wire. She exudes a calm presence in these photographs, but do not be fooled. She was an adamant defender of the arts and arts education’.\n‘Contemplating her oeuvre with even a fraction of the concentration that she devoted to creating it makes our minds supple,’ comments Robert Storr. ‘The time is right for Asawa to return to our attention’.\nRuth Asawa: Line by Line is at Christie’s in New York 9 September – 3 October, and Christie’s in Tokyo 16 October – 6 November.

The products of this genre are characteristically free and loosely structured, stylistically. They tend to focus on the sensual and psychological subjects, but as abstractions, essentially avoid any clear representational imitation of reality.\nHowever great a disaster World War II was, it did at least mean that artists such as Paul Klee, Marcel Duchamp, Piet Mondrian and Max Ernst, in leaving Europe for the safety of the USA, greatly extended their artistic influence. It is impossible to estimate how much they affected American art, but the fact remains that in the 1940s and '50s, for the first time, American artists became internationally important with their new vision and new artistic vocabulary, known as Abstract Expressionism.\nThe first public exhibitions of work by the ``New York School'' of artists-- who were to become known as Abstract Expressionists-- were held in the mid '40s. Like many other modern movements, Abstract Expressionism does not describe any one particular style, but rather a general attitude; not all the work was abstract, nor was it all expressive. What these artists did have in common were morally loaded themes, often heavyweight and tragic, on a grand scale. In contrast to the themes of social realism and regional life that characterized American art of previous decades, these artists valued, above all, individuality and spontaneous improvisation. They felt ill at ease with conventional subjects and styles, neither of which could adequately convey their new vision. In fact, style as such almost ceased to exist with the Abstract Expressionists, and they drew their inspiration from all directions.\nThe painters who came to be called ``Abstract Expressionists'' shared a similarity of outlook rather than of style-- an outlook characterized by a spirit of revolt and a belief in freedom of expression. The main exponents of the genre were\nbut other artists included\nThe term Abstract Expressionism was first used by Robert Coates in the March issue of the New Yorker in 1936. The movement was hugely successful, partly due to the efforts of the critics Harold Rosenberg and Clement Greenberg who also originated the terms Action Painting and American Style.\nStella's works have been called critical rebellion against abstract expressionism as well as heralded as examples of it. The works of Frank Stella have evolved to exhibit the extravagant designs, wild flourishes, and vivid, variety of the chromatic spectrum that makes him an expressionist. But on the surface, his first works seem hardly effusive or passionate. Still, even the minimal, geometric patterns of his early work must not be dismissed as simple and cold. They hint at the deep mystery and illusion as he breaks the structure of framing and two-dimensional ground and maintains personality of line even in the deceptively hard-edge Black and Metallic exhibit. His more recent pieces, high relief collages and metallic sculpture, are more clearly bold, progressive works influenced by abstract expressionism.\nPollock, Jackson (1912-56). American painter, the commanding figure of the Abstract Expressionist movement.(also known as Jack the dripper)\n``On the floor I am more at ease, I feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk around in it, work from the four sides and be literally `in' the painting.'' -- Jackson Pollock, 1947.\nHe began to study painting in 1929 at the Art Students' League, New York, under the Regionalist painter Thomas Hart Benton. During the 1930s he worked in the manner of the Regionalists, being influenced also by the Mexican muralist painters (Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros) and by certain aspects of Surrealism. From 1938 to 1942 he worked for the Federal Art Project. By the mid 1940s he was painting in a completely abstract manner, and the `drip and splash' style for which he is best known emerged with some abruptness in 1947. Instead of using the traditional easel he affixed his canvas to the floor or the wall and poured and dripped his paint from a can; instead of using brushes he manipulated it with `sticks, trowels or knives' (to use his own words), sometimes obtaining a heavy impasto by an admixture of `sand, broken glass or other foreign matter'. This manner of Action painting had in common with Surrealist theories of automatism that it was supposed by artists and critics alike to result in a direct expression or revelation of the unconscious moods of the artist.\nPollock's name is also associated with the introduction of the All-over style of painting which avoids any points of emphasis or identifiable parts within the whole canvas and therefore abandons the traditional idea of composition in terms of relations among parts. The design of his painting had no relation to the shape or size of the canvas -- indeed in the finished work the canvas was sometimes docked or trimmed to suit the image. All these characteristics were important for the new American painting which matured in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Action painting: Pollock was the first ``all-over'' painter, pouring paint rather than using brushes and a palette, and abandoning all conventions of a central motif. He danced in semi-ecstasy over canvases spread across the floor, lost in his patternings, dripping and dribbling with total control. He said: ``The painting has a life of its own. I try to let it come through.'' He painted no image, just ``action'', though ``action painting'' seems an inadequate term for the finished result of his creative process. Lavender Mist is 3 m long (nearly 10 ft), a vast expanse on a heroic scale. It is alive with colored scribble, spattered lines moving this way and that, now thickening, now trailing off to a slender skein. The eye is kept continually eager, not allowed to rest on any particular area. Pollock has put his hands into paint and placed them at the top right-- an instinctive gesture eerily reminiscent of cave painters who did the same. The overall tone is a pale lavender, maide airy and active. At the time Pollock was heiled as the greatest American painter, but there are already those who feel his work is not holding up in every respect.\nLee Krasner (1908-84), who married Pollock in 1944, was not celebrated at all during her lifetime (cut short in 1956 by a fatal car crash), but it was actually she who first started covering the canvas with a passionate flurry of marks. The originality of her vision, its stiff integrity and its great sense of internal cohesion, is now beginning to be recognized. Cobalt Night (1962; 237 x 401 cm (7 ft 9 1/3 x 13 ft 2 in)) at 4 m (over 13 ft) is even larger than Lavender Mist and has the same kind of heroic ambition.\n1950 Change was in the air and on the walls. Europe's boldest artistic experiments had become almost mainstream. Startling innovations were being experimented in America by artists like Jackson Pollock, and Willem de Kooning to term the radical art movement Abstract expressionism. Abstract expressionism would take America by surprise. A leading New York School painter, Jackson Pollock (also known as Jack the dripper) delved into Karl Jung's theory of the collective unconsciouness. During this time modern paintings were to say the least abstract, and often dealt with the artists psyche and state of mind when the painting was created.\nLike movements in time, abstract expressionism would develop a new and improved look (so to speak). If abstract expressionism was to be thought of as abstract, hard edge painters took out the \"abstract\" in painting. Hard edge paintings exhibited calculated, impersonal expressionism; instead of spontaneous, subjective abstract expressionism. Hard edge painters preferred sharply contoured, simple forms. The paintings are termed as \"precise and cool\", as if made by machines. Frank Stella perfectly describes Hard edge painting as: \"What you see is what you see\"......."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"verbose and natural"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"comparison"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a23a988a-9260-4898-b6b6-fec01aff6308>","<urn:uuid:7ba8feea-6682-4256-9d25-8a9c6652dca9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the difference between vulnerability and adaptation to climate change?","answer":"Vulnerability is the degree to which people or things they value are susceptible to climate change impacts, comprising three dimensions: exposure (degree of possible exposure to change), sensitivity (potential harm from exposure), and adaptive capacity (ability to reduce harm). Adaptation, on the other hand, refers to adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to climate impacts, involving changes in processes, practices, and structures to moderate potential damages or benefit from opportunities. While vulnerability describes susceptibility to harm, adaptation represents the active response to minimize risks and build resilience.","context":["Disparities in exposure to climate change risk and vulnerability\nDisparities in exposure to climate change risk and vulnerability, including variations in people’s location, wealth, social differences (age, gender, education), risk perception\nDetailed examples of two or more societies with contrasting vulnerability\nVulnerability refers to the degree to which people or the things they value are susceptible to, or are unable to cope with, the adverse impacts of climate change. Thus, vulnerability determines how severe the impacts of climate change might be. There are three dimensions of vulnerability to climate change: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity.\nExposure is the degree to which people and the things they value could be exposed to climate variation or change;\nSensitivity is the degree to which they could be harmed by that exposure; and\nAdaptive capacity is the degree to which they could mitigate the potential for harm by taking action to reduce exposure or sensitivity.\nThe expression “things they value” not only refers to economic value and wealth, but also to places and to cultural, spiritual, and personal values. In addition, this expression refers to critical physical and social infrastructure, including such physical infrastructure as police, emergency, and health services buildings, communication and transportation networks, public utilities, and schools and daycare centers, and such social infrastructure as extended families, neighborhood watch groups, fraternal organizations, and more. The expression even refers to such factors as economic growth rates and economic vitality. People value some places and things for intrinsic reasons and some because they need them to function successfully in our society. Some groups of people are inherently more vulnerable to climate change than others. The very old or very young, the sick, and the physically or mentally challenged are vulnerable. Disadvantaged groups, such as minorities, those with few educational opportunities, or non-English speakers are more vulnerable than the majority, better-educated, English-speaking population. Women, who typically spend more time and effort on care-giving to parents, children, and the sick than men do, are more vulnerable because that care-giving exposes them more to the impacts of climate change. More vulnerable groups often combine these categories, such as the poor—who can be old, minority, non-English speaking, and female, for example. Another example of a particularly vulnerable group is the single-mother household, which can be headed by a poor woman of color who is responsible not only for caregiving, but also for providing the family income.\nThe concept of resilience is important to understanding adaptive capacity to climate change. Resilience refers to the ability of a human system to withstand contemporary shocks and to anticipate and plan for future shocks. Resilient systems have the ability to learn from past experiences and to use that knowledge when confronting problems. Systems with high adaptive capacity are therefore resilient and able to reconfigure themselves to deal with climate change. Systems with low adaptive capacity are much less resilient and much more vulnerable to climate change.

Climate change adaptation, as per the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), refers to “adjustments in ecological, social, or economic systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli and their effects or impacts.”Adaptation refers to changes in “processes, practices and structures to moderate potential damages or to benefit from opportunities associated with climate change”(see http://unfccc.int/focus/adaptation/items/6999.php). The purpose of these adaptations is to decrease vulnerability and minimize risks for humans and ecosystems. Common approaches focus on expanding resilience or “adaptive capacity”by people, groups, and institutions.\n- Vulnerability and resilience\nare inherently social concepts and tied to social equity. Someone’s sex, socioeconomic standing, assets, age, education, ethnicity, and other variables strongly influence her/his relative vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and related risks. Adaptation to climate change is likely to be inefficient and inequitable if it does not consider the multidimensional and differentiated nature of poverty and vulnerability. Adaptation strategies are highly context-specific and culturally bound;they should build on capacity, assets, and traditional responses to climate variability and not erode long-standing adaptive capacities. While serving immediate needs is important, there is also a place for structural reforms to address vulnerability and its causes as well as incentives and capacity building for institutional and governance structures.\n- Gender relations\nrefer to the relations of power and dominance that influence the life chances of women and men. These relations impact individual and household vulnerability to climate-related risks, and also determine the acceptability of proposed CCA actions and their outcome.\n- The term\nrefers to how societies and specific cultures assign roles and ascribe characteristics to men and women on the basis of their sex. For example, many cultures share expectations that women and girls are responsible for water collection, family hygiene and sanitation practices, agricultural duties, and family care, whereas men are more involved in control over cash income and in household and community decisions.\n- Gender roles\n, which are formal and informal beliefs about how men and women are supposed to behave, are learned. These roles, as well as the relations between men and women—referred to as\n—are not static. They change, depending on societal values and social change in women’s status relative to men’s status. For example, women are not taught or allowed to swim or climb trees in many cultures due to modesty issues. These limitations proved fatal for many women during tsunami-caused flooding in Aceh and elsewhere.\n- The term\n, as enshrined in international and national constitutions and other human rights agreements, refers to equal rights, power, responsibilities, and opportunities for women and men, as well as equal consideration of their interests, needs, and priorities. Advancing gender equality often involves eliminating formal and informal barriers and other types of discrimination that are based on someone’s sex. In insurance and loan schemes for CCA investments, women as individuals may have less access than men because they do not have land titles for use as collateral. Women own less land than men and have less secure access due to sex-based discrimination in formal and informal tenure systems.\n- Gender analysis\nrefers to a variety of methods that are used to understand the relationships between men and women, relative access to resources, and the different constraints that they face. These analyses can address multiple levels, from intra-household to community to higher social, political, or institutional levels. Box 1 above highlights several key gender topics for the gender analyses for CCA project design. Gender analyses also consider gender\n, which refers to the sex ratio of men and women, in terms of percentages, in various positions in societies, organization, and systems such as economic value chains. As part of gender analysis, other social differences (e.g., race, ethnicity, religions, culture, class, age, disability, and status) are considered to identify differences among women and differences among men. For example, both men and women from richer households are likely to be more resilient in the face of climate change and better able to adopt climate-friendly technologies.\n- Gender mainstreaming\nrefers to the art and science of interpreting gender data and creating tailored policy, program, or project strategies that are culturally appropriate, minimize negative social impacts, and advance gender equality while achieving other project objectives. Gender mainstreaming strategies are relevant to project design, implementation, and M&E. To this end, many projects and institutions develop\ngender equality principles\n, as well as more specific GAPs, with commitments and delegation of responsibilities. In some cases, oversight is delegated to\ngender focal points\n(GFPs), who serve as internal gender advocates and resource people for other staff. Examples of these mainstreaming actions can be found in the case studies (Section 8).\n- Rights-based approaches\nare a methodology employed during project preparation and implementation, which uses human rights as a framework to guide the development process. It starts from the assumption that people have a human right to achieve economic, social, and cultural development."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"concise and natural"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"comparison"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"novice"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6af4738a-8621-405d-94ad-e9d2979659b5>","<urn:uuid:26c2936a-c5bd-453e-9b92-7a0654cb1e1f>"],"error":null}

But sometimes, one person, working alone, makes a stunning discovery that changes a scientific field forever. Neil Bartlett, while working alone in his laboratory, demonstrated that the \"inertness\" of the Group VIII elements was not a fundamental law of nature as previously believed. Bartlett's discovery meant that all existing textbooks had to be rewritten.\n- Disproving Beliefs about the Noble Gases\n- Early Research Yields a Mysterious Compound\n- Bartlett’s Simple Experiment with Xenon\n- Promising Developments from Noble Gas Chemistry\n- Biography of Neil Bartlett (1932-2008)\n- Research Notes and Further Reading\n- Landmark Designation and Acknowledgments\n- Cite this Page\nScientists had always believed that noble gases, also known as inert or rare gases, were chemically unable to react. Helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon (all gases at room temperature) were viewed as the \"loners\" of the Periodic Table. Their inertness became a basic tenet of chemistry, published in textbooks and taught in classrooms throughout the world.\nConventional scientific wisdom held that the noble gas elements could not form compounds because their electronic structure was extremely stable. For all except helium, the maximum capacity of the outer electron shell of the noble gas atom is eight electrons. For helium, that limit is just two electrons. These electron arrangements are especially stable, leaving the noble gases without a tendency to gain or loose electrons. This led chemists to think of them as totally unreactive.\nA few chemists questioned the absolute inertness of the noble gases. Among those scientists were Walter Kossel in 1916 and Nobel-prize winning chemist Linus Pauling in 1933. They predicted that highly reactive atoms such as fluorine might form compounds with xenon, the heaviest of the noble elements and whose electrons, they observed, were not as tightly bound as those of the lighter gases.\nIn 1961 Neil Bartlett was teaching chemistry at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Some years earlier, while experimenting with fluorine and platinum, he had accidentally produced a deep-red solid whose exact chemical composition remained a mystery. With the assistance of his graduate student Derek Lohmann, he vigorously pursued the identity of the red solid. After much research, they eventually found that the known gaseous fluoride, platinum hexafluoride (PtF6), was able to oxidize oxygen and produce the red solid, which he and Lohmann had identified as O2+PtF6-.\nWhat was most unusual about this compound was that it contained oxygen in the form of positively charged ions, although oxygen usually has a net negative charge. Oxygen normally pulls electrons from other atoms and is thus called an oxidizing agent or oxidant. But Bartlett believed that in this case, the PtF6 component was a more powerful oxidizing agent than even oxygen and was extracting electrons from oxygen, leaving oxygen with a net positive charge. Even though PtF6 was first prepared some years earlier by researchers at Argonne National Laboratory, its oxidizing power had not been recognized until Bartlett's research. It was this development that led Bartlett to theorize that if PtF6 could oxidize oxygen, then it might also be able to achieve the \"impossible\" task of oxidizing xenon, whose ionization potential (energy required to remove an electron) was very similar to that of oxygen.\nIn March of 1962, Bartlett concocted a simple experiment to test his hypothesis. He set up a glass apparatus containing PtF6 — a red gas — in one container and xenon — a colorless gas — in an adjoining container, separated by a seal. Here's his recollection of the ensuing experiment, which he conducted while working alone in his laboratory:\n\"Because my co-workers at that time (March 23, 1962) were still not sufficiently experienced to help me with the glassblowing and the preparation and purification of PtF6 [platinum hexafluoride] necessary for the experiment, I was not ready to carry it out until about 7 p.m. on that Friday. When I broke the seal between the red PtF6 gas and the colorless xenon gas, there was an immediate interaction, causing an orange-yellow solid to precipitate. At once I tried to find someone with whom to share the exciting finding, but it appeared that everyone had left for dinner!\"1\nThe reaction took place at room temperature \"in the twinkling of an eye\" and was \"extraordinarily exhilarating,\" recalls Bartlett. He was certain that the orange-yellow solid was the world's first noble gas compound. But convincing others would prove somewhat difficult. The prevailing attitude was that no scientist could violate one of the basic tenets of chemistry: the inertness of noble gases. Bartlett insisted that he had, to the amusement and disbelief of some of his colleagues! The proof was in the new compound he had made. That orange-yellow solid was subsequently identified in laboratory studies as xenon hexafluoroplatinate (XePtF6), the world's first noble gas compound.\nWithin months, other chemists successfully repeated the experiment. Although the intricate chemical details behind the reaction would take years to clarify and the formula of the colorful solid was later modified as [XeF]+[PtF5]-, the significance of the experiment remained clear. Spurred by Bartlett's success, other scientists soon began to make new compounds from xenon and later, radon and krypton. With Bartlett's simple experiment, the old \"law\" of the unreactivity of the noble gases had been vanquished. The new field of noble gas chemistry, with its exciting possibilities, had been launched.\nBartlett's experiment opened the door to a better understanding of the oxidation states of atoms and their possible reactions. Today, noble gas chemistry has become a powerful tool for developing new compounds with useful properties. \"The important aspect of my discovery,\" Bartlett says, \"was to draw attention to fundamental chemical considerations - especially that quantitative energy differences are important when considering variations in the chemistry of the elements in a Periodic Table framework.\"2\nBartlett estimates that more than 100 noble gas compounds are known today. These fragile compounds are energy rich: they tend to be extremely unstable and therefore highly reactive. More are being discovered every year. In 2002, researchers at the University of Helsinki in Finland reported the formation of the first and only known argon compound (produced at extremely low temperatures). Of the six known noble gases, only helium and neon have not formed compounds to date.\nNoble gas compounds have already made an impact on our daily lives. XeF2 has been used to convert uracil to 5-fluorouracil, one of the first anti-tumor agents. The reactivity of radon means that it can be chemically scrubbed from the air in uranium mines and other mines. Excimer lasers use compounds of argon, krypton or xenon to produce precise beams of ultraviolet light (when electrically stimulated) that are used to perform eye surgery for vision repair.\nCompounds of the gases are poised to play an even bigger role in the future. Researchers recently succeeded in combining noble gases with hydrocarbons, a development that could lead to new and better synthetic approaches to some organic materials. Noble gas compounds also show promise as green chemistry reagents that allow for more environmentally-friendly manufacturing processes. Bartlett believes even the highly fragile compounds being produced in Helsinki will provide benefits as yet unforeseen. All trace their legacy back to the pivotal moment in a chemistry lab at the University of British Columbia, when a clever young scientist turned conventional wisdom upside down with the help of a memorable experiment and changed the face of chemistry forever.\nI think I identified at times with the inert gases, and at other times anthropomorphized them, imagining them lonely, cut off, yearning to bond. Was bonding, bonding with other elements, absolutely impossible for them?\"\n— Oliver Sacks, Uncle Tungsten (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2001), p. 202, fn. 8.\nNeil Bartlett was born September 15, 1932 in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom. One of his earliest, formative memories was of a laboratory experiment he conducted in a grammar school class as a twelve year old. In the experiment, he mixed a solution of aqueous ammonia (colorless) with copper sulfate (blue) in water, causing a reaction which would eventually produce \"beautiful, well-formed crystals.\" From that moment \"I was hooked,\" writes Bartlett, who yearned to know why the transformation took place.3 He could not have known that the event would vaguely foreshadow his famous experiment decades later in which he produced the world's first noble gas compound following a similarly stunning chemical reaction.\nHe began to immerse himself in chemistry to the extent that he built his own makeshift laboratory in his parent's home, complete with flasks and beakers and chemicals he purchased at a local supply store. That curiosity carried over into academic success and eventually earned him a scholarship for his undergraduate education.\nBartlett attended King's College in Durham (U.K.), where he received his Bachelor of Science degree in 1954 and his doctorate in 1958. That year Bartlett was appointed a lecturer in chemistry at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada, where he remained until 1966, eventually reaching the rank of full professor. In 1966 he became a professor of chemistry at Princeton University while also serving as a member of the research staff at Bell Laboratories. In 1969, he joined the University of California, Berkeley, as a professor of chemistry, retiring in 1993. From 1969 to 1999 he also served as a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Bartlett became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2000. Bartlett died on August 5, 2008.\nBartlett's fame goes beyond the inert gas research to include the general field of fluorine chemistry. He held a special interest in the stabilization of unusually high oxidation states of elements and applying these states to advance chemistry. Bartlett is also known for his contributions toward understanding thermodynamic, structural, and bonding considerations of chemical reactions. He helped develop novel synthetic approaches, including a low-temperature route to thermodynamically unstable binary fluorides, including NiF4 and AgF3.

The text of the plaque on the campus of UBC reads in English and French:\nIn this building in 1962 Neil Bartlett demonstrated the first reaction of a noble gas. The noble gas family of elements - helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon - had previously been regarded as inert. By combining xenon with a platinum fluoride, Bartlett created the first noble gas compound. This reaction began the field of noble gas chemistry, which became fundamental to the scientific understanding of the chemical bond. Noble gas compounds have helped create anti-tumor agents and have been used in lasers.\nC'est en 1962, dans cet édifice, que Neil Bartlett a fait la première démonstration de la réactivité d'un gaz rare. Dans la classification périodique des éléments, les gaz rares - hélium, néon, argon, krypton, xénon et radon - étaient auparavant considérés inertes. En combinant du xénon et du fluorure de platine, Bartlett a créé le premier composé de gaz rare. Cette expérience a constitué le point tournant du domaine de la chimie consacré aux gaz rares et elle est devenue fondamentale pour la compréhension scientifique de la liaison chimique. Les composés de gaz rares ont contribué à créer des agents servant au traitement de tumeurs et ont été utilisés dans les lasers.\nAdapted for the internet from “Neil Bartlett and the Reactive Noble Gases,” produced by the National Historic Chemical Landmarks program of the American Chemical Society in 2006.\nAmerican Chemical Society National Historic Chemical Landmarks.

{"question":"What unique characteristics did Darwin discover about Galapagos wildlife, and what current environmental threats are these species facing?","answer":"Darwin discovered that Galapagos wildlife had developed specific adaptations to their environment, such as iguanas with large claws for gripping slippery rocks and finches with varied beak sizes suited to different food sources. He observed that these species had evolved from mainland relatives but developed distinct characteristics over generations through natural selection. Today, these unique species face significant environmental threats due to climate change. The warming oceans contain less oxygen, forcing fish to migrate to colder, deeper waters and adapt by becoming smaller in size. This creates a chain reaction affecting fish-eating animals like sea lions, marine iguanas, penguins, and sharks. Additionally, more frequent and intense El Niño events are predicted to further impact the archipelago's biodiversity.","context":["Theory of Evolution - Doral Academy Preparatory\nTranscript Theory of Evolution - Doral Academy Preparatory\nTheory of Evolution\n• Charles Robert Darwin\n• Born February 12 1809 –\nApril 19 1882)\n• He was an English\n• He published his theory\nof evolution with\nevidence In his 1859\nbook “On the Origin of\nThe voyage of the Beagle\n• In December 1831, the British ship HMS Beagle\nset sail from England on a five year trip around\n• Darwin was on board as a naturalist\n• His job was to learn as much as possible about\nthe living things he saw on the voyage.\n• Darwin's observations led him to develop one of\nthe most important scientific theories of all time;\nthe theory of evolution by natural selection.\n• Darwin made many observations along his stops\non the Beagle\n• Darwin's observations included the diversity\nof living things, the remains of ancient\norganisms, and the characteristics of\norganisms on the Galapagos Islands.\nDarwin was amazed by the tremendous diversity\nof living things.

Seeing tropical corals and parrot fish, sea lions and sub-Antarctic penguins all sharing the same coastal habitat was mind-blowing.\nThis unique combination of marine life happens nowhere on this planet but here. That is because this isolated archipelago in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean is at the crossroad of major warm and cold water currents, making it a cradle of unique marine biodiversity.\nBut isolated as they may be, the Galapagos Islands aren’t immune to the impacts of anthropogenic climate change.\nWhat are the implications and ripple effects of a warming ocean, sea level rise, ocean acidification and the intensification of El Niño events for the Galapagos’ marine biome? These are fundamental questions that remain unanswered. This sense of urgency surrounding the irreversible change in the Galapagos motivated the marine scientists of the CDF – the team that I’m part of – to develop a priority marine research agenda centered around climate change.\nTo make sure we nail it, we called upon top-notch leading marine scientists, socio-economic and policy experts in climate change, to give us a hand. It all kicked-off on the 25th of October when we held a four-day International Climate Change Workshop at the Charles Darwin Research Station.\nThe atmosphere at the workshop was electric, especially for an early-career marine scientist like myself. For the first time I got to see how the wicked multi-faced problems that climate change is imposing on this iconic archipelago can be addressed by a cross-disciplinary approach.\nThe situation today in the Galapagos is precarious – both ecologically and economically – thus, only by proactively planning for adaptation and implementing dynamic new policies aimed at mitigating the impacts of climate change will the Galapagos be able to thrive in the future.\nAmong the things that struck me during the workshop was listening to Daniel Pauly explain some of the key implications of warming oceans: “Fish, especially the larger ones, will have difficulty breathing, as warmer ocean can hold less oxygen, meaning they will migrate to colder and deeper waters, and over time many fish species will have to shrink in size to adapt to a sea with less oxygen.”\nYou can already start to imagine the chain reaction of detrimental impacts that the displacement of fishes will have on the region. Here on the Enchanted Islands, the consequences would be harsh for fishermen and fatal for many fish-eating animals, including iconic species such sea lions, marine iguanas, penguins, cormorants, boobies and sharks, which tourists pay thousands of dollars to come and see.\nAnother hot discussion topic was El Niño, the strongest inter-annual climate fluctuation on Earth. The Galapagos lie at the epicentre of this cycle that occurs once every 15-20 years, though current predictions estimate that these events will take place more frequently and will be more intense due to the changing climate. As a result, Galapagos can serve as a microcosm to explore and study creative solutions for adaptation and designing policy solutions for people and nature that can be replicated elsewhere. The Galapagos Islands first showed us how life evolved on this amazing blue planet, and now it can show us how we need to adapt to climate change.\nI assisted the Communications team in the interview with Boris Worm. Video by Julio Rodriguez.\nIt was fascinating to witness the coming together of such an important research agenda. Jon Witman’s remarks on the last day nicely sum it all up: “I have attended countless workshops, and this is one of the few where the attendees have worked together so effectively to develop solid and actionable outputs.”\nSalomé Buglass is a marine scientist at the CDF since 2016. She is engaged in several applied research projects that support the management of the Galapagos Marine Reserve. These include undertaking the first comprehensive characterization of deep-sea ecosystems in the Galapagos, supporting the Galapagos National Parks in evaluating the effectiveness of the no-take reserves, monitoring the sub-tidal coastal ecosystems, and assessing the spatial and temporal distribution of shark populations within the reserve.\nSalomé has a background in biogeography with a strong focus on climate change and has worked with marine ecosystems and fisheries in the Caribbean, Canada. and most recently in Ecuador. She believes healthy ocean and land resources are the foundation for human wellbeing, and her professional and personal goal is to work towards researching and implementing solutions that can counter the degradation of our natural environments, support their conservation and sustainable use, and improve community resilience."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"verbose and natural"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"multi-aspect"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"novice"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5bb7d388-8ec7-4c65-99c1-37e2de54e271>","<urn:uuid:3b1997b6-b3de-44bd-8c17-03d168adde35>"],"error":null}
{"question":"landlord notice period court eviction process","answer":"While Nevada doesn't specify required notice periods for move-outs, most landlords provide 30-60 days notice before lease end. For evictions, landlords must give 24-hour notice to enter the property and 5-day written notice before eviction. The eviction process requires obtaining a court order - a Notice of Termination alone doesn't end the tenancy. Landlords must apply to court within 30 days of the move-out date on the termination notice to get an eviction order.","context":["Below you’ll find answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about Nevada Landlord Tenant laws. We are not intending to provide legal advice, instead, point you in the right direction! You can review the complete Nevada law here.\nHow much notice does a landlord have to give a tenant to move out in Nevada?\nThe state of Nevada does not have governing rules on how much notice a landlord must give to a tenant before moving out. However, Nevada does require that the landlord includes in a rental agreement the duration of the agreement. This would provide a move-out date for a tenant and landlord to agree upon. For most landlords, asking tenants about renewing a lease occurs 60 – 30 days before the end of the lease. This provides ample time for a landlord to prepare a property for turnover.\nIs Nevada a landlord-friendly state?\nIn Nevada, the landlord and tenant obligations are comprehensive. It provides guidelines for rental lease agreements (at or over 12 months in length), obligations for both the landlord and tenant, and detailed remedies for scenarios such as eviction or failure to comply with a rental agreement. For these reasons, Nevada is a landlord-friendly state.\nMore reading: CHAPTER 118A – LANDLORD AND TENANT: DWELLINGS\nCan a landlord break a lease in Nevada?\nA landlord in Nevada is allowed to break a lease if a tenant intentionally damages the property and/or doesn’t comply with the rental agreement, such as not paying rent on time. In either case, a landlord is required to give notice to a tenant.\n- NRS 118A.420 Failure of tenant to comply with rental agreement or perform basic obligations: Damages; injunctive relief\n- NRS 118A.430 Failure of tenant to comply with rental agreement or perform basic obligations: Termination of rental agreement.\nCan a tenant withhold rent for repairs in Nevada?\nYes, a tenant can withhold rent for repairs in Nevada if the tenant has delivered a written notice to the landlord specifying each failure by the landlord to maintain the dwelling unit in a habitable condition and requesting that the landlord remedy the failures. The landlord has 14 days from receiving the written notice to make repairs, and if they do not, the tenant has the right to withhold any rent that becomes due without incurring late fees and to terminate the rental agreement.\nCan a landlord evict someone for no reason in Nevada?\nNo, a landlord cannot evict a tenant for no reason in Nevada. As mentioned above a landlord is allowed to terminate a rental agreement if a tenant intentionally damages the property and/or doesn’t comply with the rental agreement. If a landlord must evict a tenant, the landlord is required to give their tenants 5-day written notice of their intention to evict.\nCan a landlord enter without permission in Nevada?\nIn Nevada, a landlord must provide a 24-hour notice of intent to enter a premise, during normal business hours. Unless there is an emergency. A landlord can request access to a property to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, decorating, alterations or improvements and/or supply necessary or agreed services.\nMore reading: NRS 118A.330 Landlord’s access to dwelling unit\nWhat are landlords’ responsibilities with security deposits in Nevada?\nSecurity deposits are not required in the state of Nevada. It is also illegal for a security deposit to be more than three months of rent.\nWhen a tenant moves out, Nevada requires landlords to return the security deposit within 30 days of the end of the rental agreement. They must return the security deposit by handing it to the tenant personally at the place where the rent is paid, or by mailing it to the tenant at the tenant’s present address or, if that address is unknown, at the tenant’s last known address.\nA landlord may withhold part of the security deposit to cover any default of the tenant in the payment of rent, repair damages to the premises other than normal wear and tear, and to clean the property.\nMore reading: NRS 118A.242 Security: Limitation on amount or value; surety bond in lieu of security; duties and liability of landlord; damages; disputing itemized accounting of security; prohibited provisions.\nResources for Complete Nevada Landlord Tenant Laws:\n- CHAPTER 118A – LANDLORD AND TENANT: DWELLINGS\n- HUD – Local Tenant Rights, Laws, and Protections: Nevada\nNote: This content is not intended to substitute, replace, or be construed as professional legal advice.

The owner must get an order from the court to end the agreement and to take back possession of the premises.\nThe owner is never allowed to evict you without an order from the court (Residential Tenancies Act 1987 (WA), section 80).\nWhat is an illegal eviction?\nForcing you out of the rented premises without a court order is illegal. It is a serious breach of the Residential Tenancies Act 1987 (WA) to illegally evict a tenant. The owner, or any other person, who forces you out of the premises without a court order may be liable for a penalty ($4000 (s.80)). It is illegal for any owner to evict a tenant without a court order - Penalty $4000.\nIs the Notice of Termination an Eviction Order?\nNO. A Notice of Termination is one of the first steps an owner/agent can take if they want to end the tenancy. The Notice of Termination does not end the tenancy. The owner/agent must apply to court for an eviction order if the tenant doesn’t move out after being given a Notice of Termination.\nDISCLAIMER: While making every attempt to present general legal information accurately in this publication, TAS claims no liability for any loss or damage arising from its use. This publication should not be relied upon as a substitute for legal or other professional advice.\nWhen can an eviction happen?\nThe Residential Tenancies Act 1987 (WA) requires the owner/agent to follow certain steps before the court can give them an eviction order. This often involves giving the tenant a Notice of Termination and always involves applying to court for an order for termination and possession (eviction order).\nThe owner/agent can apply to the court for an order for termination and possession if:\n- You fail to move out after the owner/agent gives you a Notice of Termination.\nIf this happens, the owner/agent must apply to court within 30 days of the date you were told to move out on the termination notice. If they don’t apply within this time the owner/agent must start their action to terminate your tenancy again (give you a breach notice and/or another termination notice).\n- You don’t move out at the end of your fixed term tenancy.\nThe owner/agent must apply to court within 30 days of the fixed term tenancy ending. If the owner/agent doesn’t apply within this time, you may argue you have a continuing tenancy being a periodic tenancy and that the owner/agent must follow other steps in the Residential Tenancies Act 1987 (WA) before they can end your tenancy.\n- You have (or are likely to) intentionally or recklessly caused or allowed serious damage to the rented premises or injury to the owner, agent, neighbours and/or their guests.\nWhere the court gives the owner an order under this section, the order for possession takes effect immediately (s 73).\n- The owner would suffer undue hardship if s/he were required to terminate the tenancy under any other section of the Residential Tenancies Act 1987 (WA).\nIf the court gives the owner an order to end the tenancy, the court can decide when the tenancy is to end and may order compensation to the tenant for any loss caused by the tenancy being ended (s 74 (2)(b)).\nIf the court gives the owner an order to end the tenancy, you can ask the court to consider your ‘hardship’ and to suspend the order for up to 30 days (s71 & s72).\nHow will I know if the Owner has applied to court?\nThe court should send you a copy of the application (Form 12) that the owner/agent has filed. This application will give you details of the owner’s application and the time, date and place of the hearing. The notice can either be sent to your last known address or place of employment; given to you or to the person who normally pays the rent; or given to a person who seems to be living at the rented premises and who seems to be over the age of 16 (s 85).\nShould I go to court?\nYES! It is important for you to go to court and explain why you shouldn’t be evicted. The court won’t know if giving the eviction order is unfair if you don’t go to the hearing and explain why. See chapters Preparing for Court and Going to Court for more information.\nWhat if the owner is trying to evict me in retaliation?\nYou can tell the court that the owner/agent should not be given an order to evict you if you believe the owner/agent is trying to evict you out of revenge (retaliation) for action/s you have taken to secure or enforce your rights as a tenant.\nThis might be because you complained to a public authority or asked the owner/agent to carry out their responsibilities (such as to do repairs).\nYou will need to show the court what steps you took to secure or enforce your rights. The court will then require the owner/agent to show that their action to evict you is not motivated by retaliation (s. 71(3)(b) & (4)).\nThe court may refuse to give the owner/agent an eviction order unless the owner/agent proves they were not wholly or partially motivated to end your tenancy because you enforced your rights.\nWhat if the owner is trying to evict me for a minor breach, or a breach I have remedied (fixed)?\nYou should explain to the court why you think the breach is minor and why it does not justify your tenancy being ended. The court can consider all the circumstances of your case in deciding whether the breach is serious enough to justify your tenancy being ended (s.71 (3)(b).).\nYou should show the court proof that you have fixed the breach that the owner/agent has applied to court about. Be aware the court can take into account any previous breaches of your agreement when considering whether to give the owner an eviction order (s.15 (4)). See also chapter When the Tenant is in Breach of the Agreement.\nWhat happens if the court gives the owner an eviction order?\nIf the court gives the owner an eviction order and you don’t move out by the date on the order, you can be physically removed. The owner will need a Property Seizure and Delivery Order for a Bailiff (court official) to remove you from the premises. The owner can claim the cost of this order from you. The order will be dated one day after the court order and is effective for twelve months (Civil Judgments Enforcement Act 2005 (WA)).\nWhat if I wasn’t in court when the order was made?\nYou can apply for the eviction order to be “varied” or “set aside” if you were not in court when a decision was made (s17(1)). You will need to fill out a Form 16: Application to Vary or Set Aside Order (see sample form at the end of this info sheet).\nThe cost for lodging this application is $26.70 (as at January 2008). Upon lodgement you will be given a new Hearing date. The Form 16 application must be lodged within 14 days of the order having been made (s.17(2)). However, if you have good reasons for not being able to lodge it within 14 days, the court may be able to give you an extension of time (s. 20(f)).\nIf the order was for termination of your agreement, you will need to act quickly before the owner gets a Property Seizure and Delivery Order and you should seek advice about applying for a “suspension” of that Order. If the owner already has a Property Seizure and Delivery Order, and the Bailiff enforces it you will have to leave the premises and the Application to Vary or Set Aside Order may not be successful. (see chapter Community Contacts).\nAt the hearing to vary or set aside the order, you will have to have a valid reason as to why you were unable to attend the first hearing. You will also need to convince the court that there are good reasons why your case should be reheard.\nThis means, you will need to show the court that you have a good defence to the owners application to eviction (eg: that your rent was paid up to date). If you are successful, some courts will set aside the order or make a date to come back for the application to be heard. Others will immediately hear the case, so you will need to be well prepared (see chapter Preparing for Court).\nCan I be evicted if I am a Department of Housing (DH) tenant?\nDH can evict tenants and, like any other owner, must follow the Residential Tenancies Act 1987 (WA). DH can never evict you without a court order.\nIf DH is trying to evict you, try negotiating with them directly. Make sure to ask DH for information on how you can have the decision to evict you reviewed or appealed.\nAlso get help from your local community agency if DH is trying to evict you. See chapter Community Contacts for a list of advocates and community workers that may be able to assist you with tenancy matters.\nDH have their own policies which may give public housing tenants additional options to avoid being evicted. DH policies can be obtained from their website (www.housing.wa.gov.au - click on Rental Housing, then Housing Policies).\nContact Tenants Advice Service for more information.\nList of Tenants’ Rights Manual chapters referred to in this info sheet:\nSAMPLE FORM ATTACHED –"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"question-formulation","category_name":"short search query"},{"categorization_name":"premise-categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer-type","category_name":"multi-aspect"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user-expertise","category_name":"expert"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1d54a483-adca-4d6e-87c3-015568f05f46>","<urn:uuid:9786d3e3-f818-4920-98e8-67b3f432788e>"],"error":null}
